Everyone who had to get up because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road .	-5.6672
The historic maps of the Bavarian Atlas digital Bayern-Atlas , an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the State Government , are far from current - yet for this reason .	-5.8873
Especially if you compare them with current online maps .	-3.0050
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century .	-3.6148
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be recognized as such .	-3.5169
More detailed maps have been incorporated into the large map of cities and municipalities .	-5.3920
According to Bayerischer Vermessmessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and originated from Bayerns ’ first measurements .	-7.3140
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.1143
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War .	-3.5774
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical recording of Bayerns , for military purposes .	-12.0015
Although the French troops eventually departed with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian card .	-5.9473
Kurfürst Max IV , Joseph continued the project , founded the " Topographische Bureau " - and thus the Bayerische VerMeasurement Management .	-5.7187
The Urposition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found like any other on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek .	-5.2094
The comparison of the former / Today is the most striking example of the state capital .	-5.8518
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-2.7538
An example of this is sub-sendling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.3627
Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , when Munich 's district .	-5.5298
Today Untersendling lies in the middle of the city .	-3.0240
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today ’ s Plinganserstraße , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser , a leader of Bavaria ’ s uprising against Austria in 1705 .	-4.6347
Where the West Park is today , nothing can be seen as fields - at first glance : a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwriting numbered pieces from the so-called " primeval photo " from which the base tax was derived .	-8.2943
Small parcels are no longer evidence of farmers - but small gardeners of the " Land in Sun " plant .	-5.7281

On the other side of the Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.6516
In the Urposition sheet , the area of the current Au-Haidhausen district , not only reads the street name " at Gasteig " or from the height " on the lilies " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-6.9771

" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the anchor of the so-called mistakes .	-5.1471
He has also banned staff from using violence against the inmates , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Haidhausen Museum , who has worked on the Anstalt for an . , , . , , . , . . and . . . , . .	-11.4031

Citizens ' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-3.6700
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-3.7474
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the Missouri State , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travellers , visitors and Missouri to pay particular attention when travelling through the state and to take extreme care , because a number of dubious , race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are recorded here , " says the group 's opinion .	-8.1593
A recently adopted Missouri law , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as state law enforcement authorities , which disproportionately target minorities , prompted the group to issue travel warning .	-5.2783
" They have breaches of civil rights that people happen .	-2.7283
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-3.2264
'We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not yet heard . '	-3.2065
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-2.7256
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-1.8519
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during the journey through the state and was taken custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .	-5.5970
The Council also points out a recent report by the Missouri General Office of the Public Prosecutor , which shows that black drivers in the state are subject to 75 % more frequently than white .	-6.0447
" The recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees inform what could happen in Missouri , " Chapel said .	-2.9673
'People must be prepared , whether they bring deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . '	-5.2718
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI Hasscrime report , which classify the state in terms of the number of such injuries .	-4.1742
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law , which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.8387
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigrant offences , which , ACLU believes will contribute to further race profiling . .	-5.3634
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.8693
Weidezaun Project is elementary	-1.4143
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.1389
The CDU MEPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on the ground .	-4.3916
At the court of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-5.3394
Markus Schwendemann gave insights into his business , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , providing 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments .	-5.2392
For him , the ' Black Forest milk ' is an alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , as sisters .	-5.7547
The guests ’ table is exclusively regional .	-4.7813
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach , he called the Weidezaun project as " elementary importance " .	-4.1344
I cannot make profitable on such steep areas .	-3.5205
The green area for a lot of work , much needs to be done with Motorsense .	-4.9835
" We have to fight with the conditions and topography " , said Schwendemann .	-3.3424
In 2003 , he took over the parental plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not run organic .	-6.6399
For mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is pleased with the Leader promotion " .	-5.1703
At the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare farmers would have to be supported .	-2.9249
It is hoped that this would lead to the reforestation of land for a while .	-5.2264
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and who think about how to get their farm , " said the mayor said .	-6.4523
Farmers are often criticized for promoting the promotion of farmers .	-4.6956
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .	-2.8440
The surface is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be explored until at least 2023 .	-5.7492
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was promoted over Leader , a quarter of Fischerbach .	-5.9003
Thus , farmers remained EUR 12 610 million they had to invest in 16.2 km of willow fence .	-7.7074
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences " , explained Schwendemann .	-2.2021
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You do a good job , without farmers and rural women is not going to go ' .	-5.4843
Peter Weiß said : " Best food is produced here " .	-3.9953
The Landscape Courts ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of Weidefenfenfenfences .	-5.5705
The aim is to open up the Black Forest .	-2.1347
The prerequisite is the existence of a funding backdrop referred to by the LPR .	-5.1793
In addition , the fencing area must not be manageable ( increase over 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation .	-6.0094
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the request of eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence .	-5.4908
The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .	-4.8645
Is nothing sacred ?	-1.2004
Now , Trump ’ s White House is Prevention of Liberty	-4.7718
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues .	-2.3152
Americans , like any other – so the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein ’ s stronghold in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.9425
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologists , knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the statue of freedom .	-4.0742
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.6516
A Horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have recalled him if he had done so .	-4.5035
But he attacked its importance , and in particular the importance attributed to it when Emma Lazarus ’ s famous poem in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-6.5319
When Miller Acosta said : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world . , , . , , . . , and . . , . , and . . .	-9.9838
The poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom . '	-3.2727
Miller is correct , but , as he himself said , it is not really a matter of history .	-9.3469
It is about contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only to any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your moses , your poor , / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely , / the wretched waste of your rich coasts ' .	-7.6355
There was never a time when the ' elding waste ' was better seen on our screens .	-4.2359
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.5657
This conflict because of the importance of statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict over America ’ s meaning .	-3.4317
Lazarus - and her friends who sought to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act .	-4.6271
The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a used classic visual representation .	-5.4786
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice .	-2.6067
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of exiles .	-3.2632
The poem ’ s connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.5783
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wing wanted to change it for a long time .	-3.6675
The great shrine Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued that the statue of freedom is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservatives that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : " Lady Liberty is progressing .	-5.3318
It is supposed to wear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-1.7806
The torch should not pave the way to the United States ' .	-3.2502
Limbaugh has found a little unusual here .	-6.3037
The importance of statue is entirely a question of perception .	-3.5433
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , wretched but hopeful people after long and often dreadful journeys on the decks .	-5.2301
It is a real question of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.6971
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and goodwill they have to hear . . , . , . . . . , . . , .	-6.4858
And , of course , this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-3.0885
Their torch is not to enlighten the path , but to inflict hatred that is its only source of power .	-5.0299
2017 World Cup : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK Team	-3.6341
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team .	-2.8473
The UK ’ s performance director of athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will " make a massive contribution to the .	-4.8076
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.1547
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and the UK 's athletics must learn something from it .	-4.5616
" We welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it out , " said Black .	-2.7281
" I am talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.7290
Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2305
British athletic : it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.0440
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.8669
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.5062
Several Scottish athletes are medal candidates , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected to team captain .	-5.2525
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.2155
Your captain speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.0696
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-3.4478
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought about were great . '	-4.9005
The Commonwealth Silver medal , which will take place in the fifth World Championships , says that it is " unbelievable " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.1085
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven to be reached in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.4739
Muir ’ s medium-haul runner along this path and established five British and two European records last year .	-5.7198
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m trucks .	-3.4307
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot to watch after a great season that had won the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.8174
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot was in Team Lee McConnell .	-3.4279
The team paper says that she is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team , but in some cases , also medals and finals .	-6.3729
" The special thing about being team capitalism is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me , it makes something very special for me " , she added .	-6.6249
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-1.9119
It only shows how far we have come .	-2.2074
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podiums .	-2.6226
As regards my speech as captain ?	-2.1549
Yes , I think it went well .	-1.4835
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .	-3.2411
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-9.8472
I get a second chance to go and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . '	-4.1101
Blocking critics on Facebook : Don ’ t get a public office if you can ’ t heap voters ’ heaping voters if you cannot heed voters ’ heed .	-10.7880
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-6.7724
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .	-3.5440
He sent criticism , safe .	-3.2838
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.2257
For in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dumb , we are being slaughtered like sheep . '	-4.8754
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.3014
Hogan ’ s staff blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-3.4888
That is why the American Civil Liberties Union accused him at the beginning of this week .	-3.2524
The governor ’ s staff removed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.7753
" It is just Facebook , " many people said .	-1.9161
But it is important .	-0.6400
And it is particularly important if it is a type like hogan .	-2.8625
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular .	-2.4574
He has the second highest approval of the nation ’ s 50 governors .	-2.4866
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-1.3608
He has shown a firm hand in leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles .	-6.1207
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect to his voters and playful head to chemotherapy on his side .	-5.2757
That is why blocking people who come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum called officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-5.5320
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-2.8949
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hated people who swing the stick online .	-4.0547
The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-2.2655
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a parish , not trolls .	-4.1851
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful , and not profan . . , , . . , . . , . . , .	-7.0520
The parish cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith . . . , . . , . . , . . .	-6.9626
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hated , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.1655
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast " The Post " .	-3.6809
" I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people comment on the same subject , they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected ' .	-6.6651
What the governor ’ s employees described as " concentrated spam attack " would probably call " advocacy " .	-5.2076
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-3.1292
It is much cleaner than in previous times if you had done the same that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or arrest and silence protesters .	-4.9125
But that is precisely what is happening digital .	-2.3325
Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media .	-1.9760
President Trump is charged by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .	-2.8190
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week .	-1.7596
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated First Amendment , according to US District Court James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page .	-4.0549
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .	-1.9889
That should not be so difficult .	-1.6610
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable porto had a similar effect to the Internet . , , . , . . , . , . . , .	-8.3637
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter letters entered into his leadership .	-3.7440
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.4516
People who used pseudonyms like Juricola , Valerius , Belisarius , and Portius , wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .	-3.0750
Petitions criticized his position on the Amity Treaty , Trade , and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project online Papers .	-4.1711
But he did not silence them .	-1.8605
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourses are part of our nation .	-2.4396
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.1625

" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking , " said study leader Heiko Becher .	-3.1355

The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers to account and withdraw the police mobile brigade from the area .	-3.0222
Paniai has always been an unrest for the Indonesian government .	-2.5446
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members Mee , Moni , Dani , and Damal , who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.3751
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend Papua 's rights by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.2711

" There are new threats to foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia 's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a blacklist , " he said in a statement .	-3.8577
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-2.7567
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread injuries ' in Papua including the Paniai foundry .	-4.2940

Despite the threats and intimidation , families of the Paniai victims led to a last symbolic act of the troll : the victim ’ s body was buried on a territory precisely against the police and the military station .	-6.5480

Of those respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that was banned by TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % that were members of generation X .	-5.3258
The most common items deliberately passed on to TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.6004

However , the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.3842

Elon Musk doesn ’ t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla ’ s Order	-3.8483
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.4641
In doing so , he has failed to suggest that some of the customers has withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-6.5740
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a different , less glaring figure : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-6.9727
In recent months , Musk had often promoted the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .	-5.8763
Musk admits that 63,000 pre-orders have been withdrawn , 63,000 have .	-4.5595
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these were only non-binding reservations .	-3.3335
In case of cancellation , Tesla will pay the 1000 euros ( in the US and 1000 pounds in the United Kingdom ) .	-6.2731
Currently 455,000 such non-committal reservations , Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.8575
But the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 % of all orders could become a problem .	-5.0549
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not in demand , but on the production side .	-3.6403
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.1223
2018 it should be - all models taken together - 500,000 , 2020 a million .	-5.2202
The demand is obviously there .	-3.0414
According to Musk , 1800 reservations are available every day .	-7.2080
Anyone who orders a " Model 3 " can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla is able to run its nagel-new production lines never tested in practice without .	-7.2893
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.5296
If there are more delays , however , the unbinding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-5.2743
For then , the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from going out in the host .	-7.3528

Pruitt presented the change when its agency proved more responsive to the needs of government environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-4.0370
He did not mention the complaint raised against his previous post in a federal court .	-3.6098
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-4.6395
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for one year to give his authority more time , study the plan and avoid ' interfering in local decisions or hinder economic growth . '	-4.8431
Pruitt , who was public prosecutor of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump ’ s appointment , had long been a staunch opponent of tougher environmental legislation .	-4.6714
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulation that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry .	-3.5871
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitt regulatory rollback agenda .	-1.9654
Last month , a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA manager exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanleakage .	-5.3092
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his U-turn in ozone standards would simply reinforce the EPA ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of fulfilling the new standards .	-5.8032
" Under previous administrations , EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activists and others , and in an agreement the deadline for implementation , " said Pruitt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.6132
" We do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings and we take deadlines seriously .	-3.2450
We also take seriously the law and authority we have . '	-7.4644
Nevertheless , the EPA 's opinion said that Pruitt will at some point use his " power to delay and any other legally available powers " to ensure that the rules " are based on sound policy and the best available information ' .	-6.0201
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of ozone rules .	-2.7494
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.4253
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.2881
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that had accused the EPA this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-4.3152
" The reversal of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important benefit for health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.8999
New York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-1.6168
Ground ozone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight .	-3.6016

Representatives of public health care and environmentalists complained about Pruitts ’ surprising change of course .	-5.1932
" It is worrying how much pressure it needs to take this reasonable step from the responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.5456

Fortunately , this terrible scene played on 22 July is only a hint .	-4.0521
But when a nose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone came out very real sickness .	-5.7081
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Moore 's Ford Bridge to emulate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were recalled by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-11.7276
No one was ever accused of murders .	-2.3403
" It is really incomprehensible that in all these years , no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organise the rendition .	-5.2368
'It is a jewel on a story , but it is a burden on our souls ' .	-2.4961
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a civil rights activist .	-3.1627

According to FBI files received by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process .	-2.7746
But no one has ever been indicted .	-2.4072
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .	-5.3318
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer .	-3.3454
At about the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Malcom , a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight - allegedly for a woman .	-5.3122
Brooks said that the rumour was in the city that Hester had slept with Malcom 's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .	-4.1732
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , the FBI .	-2.1483
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-1.5876
But when they moved away from prison and approaching Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynchmob surrounded the car .	-3.5607
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes a FBI report .	-2.2155
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the murders , removed evidence and obscured the identity of witnesses ' .	-4.9890
Brooks makes it even more concise .	-2.5790
" It was an electoral right massacre , " he said .	-2.0224
'They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and when you vote , then that will happen here ' .	-3.7211
For nearly a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual replica of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde .	-3.2542
Their presentation is vivid , intriguing and is based in a kind of deep racism , many of which want to believe is no longer in America .	-6.6929
It is difficult to look and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.1297
" We do not want to talk about lynching , because we will be confronted with its severity in all of us , " she said .	-4.8325
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done .	-4.1337
The samples for this year ’ s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - pushed into a room and heard when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece .	-6.6215
Wade Marbaugh is the co-director of Greenes .	-2.1451
He has played the role of Chief Clan member for years , but he said that the role would never be easier .	-2.9030
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.4861
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to those times ' .	-2.8043
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their .	-2.7160
The piece begins with Malcom , who attacks Hester and afflicts him , angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy .	-4.9788
'I said n --- he , vanish from my property ! '	-3.4719
Rascona responds fire .	-2.2970
There is a break .	-1.0626
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .	-3.2982
Greene is lautest .	-7.7710
" What ? ! " , Rascona asked .	-1.9769
It is alarmed and confused .	-0.8958
Was I too tough ?	-1.3758
" No " , Greene said , still kicking .	-3.4993
'I simply do not think that white people at the time ' n --- he said ' .	-3.3176
" But " , one of the other black actors .	-2.2342
" You only have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-2.4504
And that is where energy is shifting in space , a sense of camera replaces the unease .	-5.0730
Everyone is concerned about getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-8.3809
The scene begins again .	-1.5918
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it strongly and forcefully .	-3.4041
No one laughs .	-1.5004
This repetition ends violent and fast .	-1.7822
There are shoe , shots and then silence .	-3.1465
A woman with a grief is above the body of the actor and carries out Billie Holidays 's mourning praise " Strange Fruit " .	-5.5784
Your voice breaks with each second word .	-3.0827
About a hundred meters behind a group of about four dozen viewers glide sweat and tears .	-5.0306
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-2.4336
A couple is made from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many people just come down .	-5.0194
They have experienced Georgian fierce moisture every nearly eight hours when Brooks leads them to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys .	-10.0790
Up to that point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lynch killings took place , the air feels cur.	-5.1514
When the last notes of the song ends , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name .	-3.3719
Children raise their heads , register the falsified blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other .	-4.4056
" They are not really dead " , murs a small boy as if he would remember it .	-4.4098
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-2.1957
The actors throw away the Lynch part and wipe their tears .	-3.2409
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man in suit who played the clan member .	-3.6227
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her poor , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks down with him .	-6.7002
" It is okay " , whispers one of the women .	-1.7765
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.6691
You did so for one reason ' .	-1.8484
Later , the audience joined with the actors for dinner .	-4.3819
At a table , a white pair of Atlanta , inspired by a black pair that they have just met .	-7.2196
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words which feel left .	-3.9508
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and who do so because they look like you , " she said .	-3.2648
'What really does with me makes me believe that Lynchen continues , " she added , " today it is only called a police starship . "	-6.8425
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks Hof keeps his table , he eating and reminds of civil rights .	-4.2296
He said he has already started planning the performance next year .	-2.7046
" The rendition is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.8790
" It is the case if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .	-3.4367

Fortunas Hoffmann : ' Triple works better "	-3.9067
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 : 2 for the season opening against Braunschweig that optimization of the defensive formation in Aue points .	-5.5835
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , and the result would not have been the two opposing gates at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-6.1835
" These were two countertores too much , and we need to be more careful in Aue , says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.3918
In the Erzgebirge , the triangle is to be further optimized .	-4.7221
And a gateway after a release , the Fortunes don ’ t want to capture .	-7.2366
'For the future , it will be the case that no one is standing alongside Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-9.5774
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the triangle than with the four-string .	-6.0901
" I don 't know how we will act in Aue , " says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure his thing , " because we have just in the triangle on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-5.2246
'Prerequisite is , but that we harmonise even better and we do not afford so many playwright mistakes . '	-5.6203
Of course Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game .	-2.4145
" But if you can talk about an unsuccessful start , don 't know .	-5.0116
The performance could be quite okay , " Hoffmann said .	-3.1624
'However , if we can stand with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season start . '	-6.2879
His coach did not want to know that .	-3.1974
" I only judge the start to the season after six to eight days " , says Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of the Sachsen in Heidenheim had to be aborted prematurely due to .	-7.0458
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a bit more fresh , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna .	-6.9185
" But they don 't know as 100 % where they are currently standing " , says the interior defender of Fortuna .	-4.5426
Although the guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting at the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue .	-5.8380
" The fact that we sweep them away simply because we have the right to come under the first six is nonsense , " says Funkel , whose record is only a defeat against Aue from nine games .	-6.6712
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which must be beaten from the outset " , explains Fortunas chief coach .	-5.3827
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant " .	-3.2741
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday .	-3.3753
New results of the Swedish Asylum Review	-6.9092
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , undergoing a new method of medical assessment show that more than 80 % of the people tested are over 18 years old , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.9066
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine ( Count Coal Codder ) has started carrying out the tests last year .	-7.1084
They are intended to clarify the age of age during the asylum procedure after the Swedish migration authority ( migration trade ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage .	-6.6678
To date , migration has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-3.9695
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older . "	-4.7045
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person ' may be under 18 years old ' .	-3.3120
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-2.7077
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-2.4932
" We see no big difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant , " he said to the magazine The Local .	-3.0245
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied to his age .	-4.1988
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that " suggest that the person investigated was 18 years or older " .	-3.3779
When Svenska Dagblag investigated the 581 results published , she found that in 243 of these cases , the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-4.7981
The method of medical age assessment , in which X-rays of Weisheitis and MRT recordings of knees , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-6.5028
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinsk Institute , whose work involves assessing people ’ s biological maturity to see whether they were sooner or later than usual by puberty .	-4.5879
" I had reason to think about this , and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.7837
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.1251
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend that we could , " he said to the newspaper Metro .	-3.8850
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is incorrect .	-9.8045
The greatest risk is if the person is less than 18 , in this case , it is about 10 % . "	-4.5511

Because on Friday advocated the dissolution of Parliament .	-3.6796

Thümler said that the red green government must now decide whether it could continue to govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.8005
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the land day decides its self-resolution as quickly as possible .	-5.4321

The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the country ’ s day deprives the prime minister and elect a successor .	-5.4567
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.3734
These possibilities need to be properly examined , " said Thümler .	-4.4817

Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoners , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.7655
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.9299
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.6549
How can consumers protect themselves .	-0.8383
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in the interview with the German editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.5145
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.6423
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp .	-8.2833
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information about the egg charges .	-5.1110
Those affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-2.4464
Even if everything we know at the moment , a health threat is virtually excluded .	-4.7103
Does Aldi take the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of educator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture ?	-4.9510
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states .	-3.0063
Nevertheless , my House has immediately opened its doors and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries of the countries .	-6.3256
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.6998
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are viable and safe for health .	-4.8913
If the maximum residue limit of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded , these are not viable .	-5.6566
However , uncontrolled eggs can be sold and consumed .	-3.2033
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-3.6504
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?	-2.5457
The current level of knowledge is not directly responsible for production companies .	-5.1888
Instead , they must face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-4.1866
As always , there are too few inspectors in the event of a disaster .	-3.9112
Is it only a matter of staff or the coherent competence ?	-5.3960
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .	-4.2186
The truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy cannot be 100 % excluded .	-3.1024
It is precisely for that reason that it is clear that such events are carried out and the transfer to public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may exist .	-8.0824
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the competent authorities to provide complete information .	-4.7088
Is regular alarm in food scandals really necessary ?	-2.0287
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and safe food .	-3.4221
When an insecticidal is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-3.3168
The loose means that manufacturers , dealers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .	-6.1184
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticidal Fipronil insecticidal in the position of food suppliers is unacceptable and must be brought to an end immediately .	-5.7896
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .	-3.3457
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are quickly and fully informed .	-5.0870
How Football ’ s Financial Regulations affect Neymar ’ s Move to Paris	-4.1830
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to Paris Saint Germain .	-3.8178
Some of the consequences will come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organisation that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions-League Tournament .	-5.4159
Financial fair play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar ’ s transfer was financed without major losses .	-3.5832
Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilians out of his contract , and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several $ 10 million a year .	-3.6145
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar ’ s move to France .	-1.7263
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar sign and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team through the Qatar ruler family .	-5.8592
Clubs may spend a lot of money to acquire players , but they must counteract legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break even point in their soccer business .	-5.8222
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.5690
Former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheated and risking ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-5.1602
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring their losses .	-3.0478
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter .	-3.7578
During the current three-year FFP publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .	-4.1496
And , while Platini fell in disgrace by the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to advocate discourage excessive spending .	-5.3105
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-2.9575
Although the PSG paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a lump sum , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .	-4.3444
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the amount of EUR 44.4 million can be expelled at the annual accounts for the next five years .	-4.2923
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .	-3.2385
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions-League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .	-5.6207
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by blowing their revenue through companies associated with clubs ’ owners .	-5.6496
While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeds standard market rates , UEFA would not allow this to be regarded as legitimate income .	-3.7448
That was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.7246
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar about payments from the organizational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .	-4.0596
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could easily be found .	-5.2333
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.2873
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars transfer , said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . , . , , . , .	-10.2309
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.2282
The latest published reports show that PSG has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 .	-3.6636
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published .	-2.5745
PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising and jerking sales .	-3.8535
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-3.4456
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.2978
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state " , said the President of La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar 's eventual ownership of PSG .	-3.4631
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports team , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .	-3.8704
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.5405
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.3108
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay , because different paths can be different or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country ' .	-5.7717

Nostalgie goes into " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " in " . . . , . .	-8.6348
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of characters of the 80s , for the 90-year Grunge era ( when the thinker David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to major things .	-6.1395
As a cultural artefact , it is also a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories . , , . , , , and .	-6.2857
But as a franchise , it feels as if time is short .	-3.1367
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-2.4461
By moving on to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children , who will grow up - they still made the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke .	-8.9149
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults who now play adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the poison principle , including a reff on the Stalker film of the 90s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that looks the cradle " ) .	-5.7507

As always , the courses are the best part of the franchise .	-3.3182
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon ’ s sublippenbart of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old crack .	-5.4844
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeated " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show how she will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-4.6548
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East West ring combat iconography .	-4.6105
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , with Rhys Thomas as director , suggests to be a television series of television : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two Bucharest officers fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism .	-5.9362
The main roles - a hardened Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executable producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt .	-3.3209
It is a brilliant idea .	-0.8887
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.3093
There are some beautiful gag gag ( police spend time watching chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-5.1145
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game ' Find the voice ' .	-2.0792
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .	-4.1547
With six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-8.7268
" Comrade Detective " , which was edited to a smaller length , could better deliver its Agitprop science , since Gregor and Iosef regularly visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who squad a pile of Hamburg .	-7.3387

The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.0130
Because the data had not been adequately maintained , data quality has not been good in parts .	-4.6818
In individual cases , data of 1921 have been found , ' by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register ' .	-6.4011

However , such misalignments led to ' a distorted debate on the treatment of refugees ' , it says in the analysis .	-7.5931
Meanwhile , the Federal Government seems to have begun to send refugee families back to Italy with children under 16-year-old children when they arrived .	-5.3400
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the New Osnabrücker Zeitung .	-3.3211
The paper says that the BAMF is conducting such procedures ' for families with children - except for infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-6.2650
Since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually no longer possible , as the newspaper citing the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.8133
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees are the responsibility of the EU State they reach first .	-4.3777
If a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry country .	-4.4740
In order to explain why the office now says : ' In the meantime , the absorption capacity for families with infant children has increased substantially in Italy ' .	-7.4031
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.4902
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-6.8716
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.2446
The domestic political spokesman of the left-wing group in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticized this decision : " Families with children threaten to accept the inadequacies of the Italian asylum system and a threat to child ' . . . . and . . . . and . . . .	-12.1817

" It is genial how our body is designed for it and we pay respect the donors who provide their blood to strangers , even unselfish , " said mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.3699
" A single blood donation helps several people " , explained the circle leader of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the conservatives are crushed into their constituents .	-5.8465
Three people could benefit from blood donation .	-2.9343
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported of the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in spring .	-5.1398

The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.0779
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and slowdown in inflation have reduced speculation .	-3.7728
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increased pressure .	-3.6227
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) policymakers voted to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with less members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase .	-4.6460
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just below 3 % in the autumn .	-4.1515
But it signaled that in the next few years , interest-rate hikes would be needed to rein in Brexit inflation , saying that borrowing costs may rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.6600
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-3.0685
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected that it will make GBP 15 billion more available under this system - with £ 115 billion .	-5.7677
minutes after the decision on interest rate , the Bank said : " In the MPC ’ s central forecast , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on households ’ real incomes continue to strain consumption . "	-4.6145
At interest rates , they repeated that " a certain tightening of monetary policy " would be needed to cool inflation and a " slightly larger " scale than markets expect .	-5.1847
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.7941
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " gradual " and " limited " .	-3.1195
The down-adjusted growth forecasts of the Bank for this year and next year are compared to 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-8.9760
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.3697
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .	-2.6156
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 , and fell by 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .	-3.0289
The decision will not be changed after the recent disappointing growth figures have reduced rising expectations of an interest-rate hike , and GDP rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the second quarter .	-5.2130
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the bank by the end of the year .	-3.4821
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal salary increases , as the worsening becomes even worse before it becomes better .	-6.0446
She added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " income collapse in the next few years , but it added that wages will be " clearly " at the end of their three-year forecast .	-5.4548
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate some of lower consumption spending .	-3.5666
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound ’ s fall .	-3.7376
The Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to fully achieve prices and the economy .	-3.8087
Before the Bank ’ s last verdict on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-4.4815
Inflation fell from 2.9 % last month to 2.6 % in June , even though the Bank said that this was expected and will raise it again in the coming months .	-3.9549
The Bank said that exceeds its 2 % target is " entirely " to the weak pound .	-3.8780
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders loudly looking for shops and end the year in a positive way .	-4.8225
The market looks particularly good for those in which existing deals expire and complete the new mortgages , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming ever more popular . '	-5.0518
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is supposed to prescribe controversial HIV-Droge 10,000 people .	-4.3091
Patients will receive access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment after a fight before the High Court against financing the drug in the NHS drug .	-5.2045
NHS England announced that preexposition prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people .	-6.5483
He agreed to finance the process after last year ’ s Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite claiming that local authorities should finance it .	-4.4957
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England CEO Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a " decisive moment " .	-4.6767
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018 .	-3.4091
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-4.3435
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infection .	-3.8923
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that only enough medicines are available in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-4.3417
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-3.1690
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.3961
In clinics , appropriate participants are identified who agree with the study , including men , women , transgender , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.8078
People living in England and registered with a doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-4.7027
The program will be £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .	-3.2954
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , including and implemented on a large scale .	-4.2669
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.6552
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of humanity ’ s greatest health challenges . '	-3.8584
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-1.8196
PrEP , if targeted at needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.2266
From September to September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .	-5.3812
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-1.5752
Ian Green , CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-4.4183
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . "	-4.4821
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Minister for Health , said : ' The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue by government delays and slow implementation .	-4.1725
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.1275
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-2.2108
It is now important that this study should be carried out as soon as possible in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.3084
The Great Life Life : intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have transformed these small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home .	-5.5913
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-2.5687
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold their bags .	-2.7678
" Before I lived in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-2.6837
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-2.3308
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.5710
I fell in love with them and made an offer on this day ' .	-3.5526
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overtaken .	-4.0129
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a meat-level to make the most of the spacious ceiling .	-6.8431
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light .	-1.7634
That was my request , " she says .	-1.7429
To this end , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for Joanne .	-4.1756
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand .	-4.7670
Erfan had to think creative to solve the preset .	-3.0906
" The steel mill is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.4981
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on each other without having to get us .	-6.2204
It was not only about building a simple platform , but also creating steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-5.2573
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .	-5.4984
A classic copper light window of Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area .	-4.0634
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-4.4289
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.7313
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored in order to allow it to work longer .	-4.3843
In the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .	-3.3308
At the entrance you can find covered units for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-5.4114
By perceptions of a glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.7256
Combining kitchens are nothing new .	-2.4885
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.6989
" A little engineering art went there , " explains Erfan of the steel market , furnied MDF door .	-4.6506
'It is counterweight , so it is very easy to slip the door . '	-5.1342
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.6581
" At the end of the day you will sell the ground - or as your property is estimated , " says Erfan .	-3.1198
'In a rudimentary form , a real estate broker will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the ground . '	-4.8817
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.7597
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-2.7507
" You don 't fall into the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.6946
These are important , but they do not play with your heart ' .	-2.0488
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metre from slightly standard .	-5.0129
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-1.9542
Brothers Fighting for $ 500 million of Real Estate Empires	-5.8011
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a dispute over $ 500 million worth of Victorias ’ s largest property empire .	-4.2908
The former director of the ' Carlton football club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be distributed .	-6.1314
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-3.3384
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers possess 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a shop in Smith Street , Collingwood .	-3.3378
The Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops .	-3.2685
It was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .	-1.3612
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city centre , Brunswick and Sorrento apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburb .	-4.3952
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as the " main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of corporate assets and Paul .	-5.1347
A court act says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-2.7577
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.7938
" The departments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought to be the best objects , " he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015 .	-9.4934
Last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed mediations .	-2.8719
The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - as Colin , as Paul claimed , excluded him .	-4.2657
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul for managing some ownership incompetent .	-3.1431
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hope to resolve the dispute .	-2.3567
" My Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.6879
The costs are rising in the case , with hundreds of pages with affidavits , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and legal firms held by both sides .	-4.4205
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.5831
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family ’ s first jeans shop .	-4.2279
Colin says that he began Westco there when he was " the High School in my last years when Paul was a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.5578
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to their sons .	-2.6961
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , " wrote them .	-2.6886
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when leaving the company .	-3.9158
Both Lukas and Mark , Paul says " have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation " .	-4.4559
Colin has remained very restrained , even though he was a former AFL Board member , and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , the best friend of television star .	-5.4339
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.5451
Only Colin responded via SMS to say " I really cannot say much " because the case was before the courts .	-4.1539
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.6746
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands .	-2.0565
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.7012
On Friday , this hope seemed over .	-1.8514
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.2320
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media disdain .	-3.5412
Others have tried and failed .	-1.1092
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do so .	-1.3739
If so , he will be the first .	-1.2977
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the head on a more consistent course .	-10.6150
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.1998
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new Chief of Staff , met with senior staff on his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that gets into the president ’ s hands .	-4.8447
Kelly said to staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he received good information . '	-3.6845
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.6246
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.5326
" If candidate was angry to Trump for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of posts to convince him , " former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said to Politico in February .	-4.9737
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . "	-3.5468
Okay .	-0.2463
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit was ever “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.9224
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know to others - that without their intervention , Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more ignition .	-5.0073
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.7141
If his staff managed to keep trouble away from him several times , their efforts have been rewarded .	-5.5917
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from provoking controversy .	-2.2697
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties , repeatedly try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.7361
Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about advisers ' preference to provide the president with dubious information to the president for strategic reasons .	-5.4414
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.1345
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press sections , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is committed to finding out where they come from .	-5.3362
That was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocation Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh accused of being " the source behind a bunch of leaks " in the White House .	-4.9725
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or that he has not offered concrete evidence , or that he has expressed false accusations and revoked them .	-5.1754
Trump read the article and began to consult Walsh staff . "	-2.9991
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram that Trump receives . "	-3.9108
How did this work ?	-1.7995
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-1.3627
Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than primebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-3.3309
These unchangeable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-1.4499

Travellers negotiate a gulf and return to the ' Millionaires ' series '	-5.1093
Some of the West Midlands ’ s wealthiest homeowners are back with some determined travellers who have negotiated a tomb from the community to reclaim a field in front of their houses .	-6.6858
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the " Millionaires series " .	-3.5819
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May , without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their incursions .	-5.1578
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unblocked to find a way .	-4.5789
Farming people have afflicted the Solihull Council , who said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.0173
An anonymous resident said : " They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-5.0902
The Council must indeed be forced to implement it because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-4.4976
Travellers were there in May , moved forward and are now back .	-2.9156
More came last night , probably even more today . '	-3.1441
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect their parks .	-3.4401
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot even stop this . '	-2.7783
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said : ' It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-4.9652
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . '	-3.8595
A speaker from Solihull Council said : " We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls , and we .	-12.6223
In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible to report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-7.3547
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the Court must examine when we submit our case ' .	-3.8865
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise	-1.1359
The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof .	-2.6437
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .	-4.4516
These are good news for the city .	-1.7927
The closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenue by the Kurtax .	-6.7649
In the autumn of 2014 , the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation to the Council of Landratsamt as a collection accommodation , causing controversial discussions .	-8.2699
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-5.0171
The decision was not uncontroversial in the municipal council .	-3.3939
But especially Freudenstadt Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interest in the house .	-5.2727
He should be right .	-1.3878
The group Luisenhotels , with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Birkenhof hotel at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it into a three-star hotel category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-6.3234
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object .	-2.2882
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-0.9750
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.9080
At the former Hotel Birkenhof , building carved containers have been in front of the entrance for some time , and when you enter the house , you can see the extensive renovation work .	-8.5906
The floors were torn out , partly covered ceilings , old bathrooms were removed from the rooms .	-5.0542
The entire hotel building is a single building site .	-2.4754
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.8960
" It is actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-3.3743
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-3.5981
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned , new windows are fitted .	-4.7873
Everything should later become " beautiful to the citizen " as Thomas Scherer says .	-5.7974
'We want to make a jewel . '	-3.3264
Swimming pool , spa and a meeting room are all equipped .	-3.7574
You don 't want to position at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but at an elevated inner city level .	-5.7673
The Waldhotel Luise , with its 60 rooms , wants to develop a wide range of facilities .	-6.8360
Both individual tourists , groups or businessmen should feel comfortable at the hotel .	-4.2222
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause , so Scherer .	-3.2311
The city 's views are equal to those of the hotel group .	-5.1184
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.7612
When it comes to the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to define exactly .	-4.9583
Nearly less than one million euros , he expects .	-3.8535
The exterior facilities are also put on front , and this is already clearly visible .	-6.2487
A large terrace is created in a courtyard which will be open from the restaurant open .	-5.9746
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.5175
Russia affair : US Special Advocates Grand Jury	-3.7409
In the Russian affair around US President Donald Trump , special agent Robert Mueller , a so-called Grand Jury , after a report .	-5.6507
The body has started work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal , using people familiar with it .	-5.5396
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations .	-3.4542
The CNN station reported that there are already first preliminary invitations to meet a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-5.8692
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of having deliberately interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-3.2659
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.6892
The investigation focuses on several men who acted as Republican advisers in the election campaign .	-4.2616
Reportedly , Mueller also looked more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.3425
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Adviser had put Trump personally into the center and investigating whether the president might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-6.2374
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether charges should be charged .	-5.4660
Grand Jurys are therefore also called charges .	-4.5694
Most of them are activated when they are larger and controversial cases .	-5.0576
The procedure is always behind closed doors .	-2.1701
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to interrogation .	-4.7371
According to the CNN transmitter , invitations have already been issued , revolving around Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-5.1150
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , the report was . . , . , , . .	-9.6744
They should also provide documents .	-1.1161
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner , as well as his opponent , Paul Manafort .	-4.0499
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the establishment shows that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that , if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .	-6.0417
However , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be put in place to decide on the charge .	-5.9233
Nevertheless , setting up the body is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-4.1942
Amid the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-2.8297
" Russia history is a complete invention , " said Trump .	-2.3921
The issue gives democrats a chance to feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about .	-3.7987
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.5931
He also usually works in secret , but he emphasized .	-4.7951
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Representative .	-4.2003
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president was not investigated .	-3.7412
There is no reason to believe that something has changed , the declaration was further down .	-5.7217
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump had fired Comey .	-2.4554
Because of this smoke , accusations against Trump had become accustomed to obstruct justice .	-6.4391
Comey said before a Senate committee committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.6975
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.5776
According to US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .	-3.6830
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to release Mueller .	-3.3765
Unlike an independent congressional congressional congressional , such as the Watergate affair around the late president Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice .	-5.3659
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.2770
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday that the special agent could no longer be dismissed .	-4.4529
Antarctica : Gigantic Ice Mountain is driving in Antarctica	-8.1868
In the West Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg has been solved by the Schelfeis .	-4.9114
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-2.6740
The colossus of more than one trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometres , is now heading north and will probably need two , three years until it is melted .	-6.0626
It is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .	-4.0477
It is not a threat to people .	-3.5329
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear after researchers ' . . , , , , and . . , . , . . . .	-10.1329
In total , however , there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice cubes in the region for about 30 years , the US Research Centre for Snow and ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-5.3838
Many researchers believe that this can be related to global warming .	-2.8322
The now broken coloss was part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis .	-4.0689
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-3.0775
It is therefore growing further into the sea and breaks regularly .	-4.7046
Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-7.7458
North of this skeleton was the balance of wax and breakdown a few years ago .	-5.8711
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete sk.	-4.5684
There is a lot in favour of the Larsen-C Schelfeis , because the front edge edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently .	-6.4363
In addition , the iceberg is under tension and can collapse if a piece of key .	-5.7622
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea levels because they swim on the water and displaces ice as much as it produces after melting .	-5.0850
However , the loss of the skeleton leads the glaciers to the sea and flow much faster than before .	-5.3256
This could possibly increase sea levels , but only a little bit , writes the British research project to monitor Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-5.9352
According to AWI data , the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest slab of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-4.8677
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean .	-3.8471
There it regularly breaks .	-3.8273
" Although it is natural and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of British Swansea University .	-4.4746
" This is the broadest withdrawal since the record , " he also confirmed .	-4.1689
It is controversial among scientists whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will now grow or retire in the long term and perhaps coincide , his colleague Adrian Luckman said , and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-6.8868
But that development will take decades .	-1.7919
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , many of the iceberg in the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen .	-5.4250
This long paddle of Antarctica stretches towards South America .	-5.6296
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-2.9727
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-2.5431
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years and is therefore one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest .	-5.3433
CDU Will Haustarif	-2.9322
Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacancies , the CDU is demanding to leave the employers ’ association to become more attractive .	-4.1415
Just before the summer recess , the district day had 41 new posts in administration .	-4.8173
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the Mettmann district administration .	-3.2784
Now 17 trainees have their first working day .	-3.6019
The teachers at the circle are obviously very desirable .	-3.9651
Approximately 620 applications were recorded for the places to be presented this year .	-4.6236
However , the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .	-4.8316
At the moment there are still 50 vacancies at the Mettmann circle .	-8.4006
Doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces .	-4.4844
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG to take the initiative to counter the shortage of skilled workers .	-5.9785
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration should " develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development " .	-6.2387
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers , but also to counteract the future shortage of applicants .	-6.6075
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive , demanding CDU , FDP and UWG .	-5.3764
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.0401
The circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known before .	-6.2174
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.7392
We are talking about a genuine ' competition between public employers ' .	-3.1450
In addition , there are a large number of employees who leave sick or age from the service .	-5.7703
So it is high time to act , so that no more jobs remain vacant .	-5.8468
But Klaus-Dieter Völker , the leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion .	-4.3661
He recently caused a fatty surprise during the district day when he publicly questioned the staff allowance and stumbled the other parties .	-7.7057
People want to see all the possibilities to leave the municipal employers ' association .	-5.2373
" If we do not reach a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with local cities - should seek a house tariff " , so people .	-7.2709
In this way , the CDU is trying to pay better for employees and officials than the public service tariff system .	-5.9290
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed , increases or more money only if you change to a higher level based on professional years .	-5.3738
But the circle ’ s tasks have increased in recent years .	-3.5864
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in order to provide employees with the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act .	-5.4305
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-3.7495
Italy Strengthening NGO Migrant Rescue	-4.7240
Italy has warned NGOs using bailouts for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue unless they comply with new rules for their operations .	-3.8009
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Secretary of the Interior , Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turiner daily La Stampa .	-3.7938
Minniti ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rettet Association , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.9049
The aid organisation , which has been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.7032
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " the organization said in an opinion on the social media .	-5.6449
'We can only judge all the accusations that are being made at the moment after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-5.1326
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Rettet ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.1258
It is suspected that his crew will take hose boat migrants , who are delivered directly by traffickers and that smugglers can leave so that ships can be used again .	-7.4007
At least such a meeting was supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media .	-4.4669
The occupation is suspected of overturning the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , monitoring rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons rather than for any other motives .	-4.3658
Under the code of conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must have , above all , an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .	-3.1996
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to keep the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta , and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-9.6896
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable because they would not bring ' significant changes or obstacles ' of their rescue operations .	-4.4956
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organization is Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.5109
Minniti has now said that , in recent weeks , the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply , suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors .	-4.9336
" In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the Minister .	-2.5228
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-3.6517
Rising and Trials	-2.6078
Nine Weilermer Biker , the " Berlin Outpost " and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-3.5794
Three friendly guides were available .	-3.0002
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley was a good starting point for the tours .	-3.8580
The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra .	-2.9811
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelschapel above Deidesheim .	-2.9546
It was followed by viewpoints , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer Forest and the upstream plains .	-7.3177
In between , there have been longer and again , for which long trials were rewarded .	-5.2399
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-2.6724
Again , viewpoint at the viewpoint , connected by " flowige " trials and moderate rise .	-6.4139
On the last two days , many meters of altitude have been met again .	-5.1710
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shopping huts brought welcome breaks .	-3.2158
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers breathe in the open-air inhalatorium .	-3.1696
Neustadt was also taxed .	-3.6398
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres in altitude , the group had met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .	-6.5874
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is equipping itself for e-sport sport .	-8.3266
Will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium in wind and weather ?	-6.7817
The fact is that E-Sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high Gagen .	-4.5063
This was also recognised by the first Bundesliga , which is becoming increasingly involved in this area .	-4.6427
At the beginning of 2015 , VfL Wolfsburg , later FC Schalke 04 and last VfB Stuttgart , who founded an E-Sports Division in mid-July and took two professional players for FIFA 17 .	-7.0684
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB " , says CEO Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.3799
He is certain that there are still a number of clubs on this train " .	-4.5184
Next weekend , the FIFA World Cup is organising the first Interactive Club World Cup in London , where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other .	-4.9505
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-2.4927
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-1.5112
The ex-student of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-3.0937
" Real football must deal with the 14 to 30 years old , that young people will continue to go to the stadium , " says the 52-year-old .	-5.8317
And : The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian ones .	-3.5523
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , one could be more present in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year .	-5.6234
What is this about ?	-2.2417
E-sport games such as League Of Legends , Dota 2 , Counterstrike , or even the football simulations FIFA at competitive level .	-5.4422
As in normal sport , leagues have become established , leagues where the professionals compete against each other .	-5.2363
And in the 2022 Asian games , E-Sport is already part of the official program .	-3.3545
But is it a real sport ?	-3.1021
For many , the idea is certainly needed .	-3.1669
Ingo Froböse has also been addressing the question for a long time .	-3.4768
For Professor at the German Sports High School in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because he is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-6.2530
It also requires cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and rapid response capability .	-7.9697
Professional gamers should not only train at the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .	-4.6069
" The fitte player is a good player . "	-1.9994
But Froevil also sees problems : " doping becomes more and more a topic " .	-4.3498
Controls could be difficult to carry out online games and the structures of classical sport were missing .	-4.7455
On the positive side , the scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-4.4844
The players are on the international road , that is like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-5.3907
A study by Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth .	-3.6911
In 2016 , it implemented EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship , and large tournaments .	-3.9489
In three years , sales will be 130 million .	-3.2289
That is little about EUR 2.4 billion of the football league .	-4.3636
However , e-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey , " the Deloitte consultants write .	-4.4890
There are many countries on the international stage .	-4.0261
Large markets are Asia and the US , where ex-car players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports .	-3.4994
Hollywood players Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn .	-1.7989
There is also a great deal in Europe .	-3.1616
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a teaching subject , Froböse says .	-3.6875
In the Netherlands and France , the first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sport department .	-4.0857
" In European comparison , Germany lags behind , " explains VfB Executive Board Röttgermann .	-3.6723
It is no longer enough to fall in nostalgia , and to hide old times is no longer enough .	-6.8026
It is a question of preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time aligning the company in the modern market .	-4.5825
" We live in a digital world " , says Dutt .	-2.1416
'It is not possible to insist that everything remains as it has always been . '	-6.8727

Almost all the federal states have now been affected by the scandal of toxic eggs .	-5.2796
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord responded and removed all eggs from the sale across Germany .	-3.5432

Michelle Carter condemns for the texts pushing Conrad Roy to suicide .	-2.4791
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend through texts and calls for suicide .	-2.4139
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their sentencing behind bars and five years have been suspended .	-3.3068
Carter was convicted in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .	-3.1078
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : " My family is untreated .	-3.7056
My son was my best friend . '	-0.9270
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .	-2.5279
She had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness .	-3.3808
Closed in red trousers and a creamy flower , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when convicted .	-12.7255
" Your actions have killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.1888
" She ended his life to make her own better .	-2.1490
She has not taken responsibility , ' she said .	-2.8119
" She did not show any repentance " .	-3.3777
But Carter 's lawyer said that it is a ' terrible circumstance that she totally regret ' .	-4.0317
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , he did not find out that their " age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions ' .	-4.2587
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy , who said that there is " no day when I do not betray the loss of my beloved son .	-3.3015
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything , and I try to be there for his sisters , despite all the pain that we will carry with us for eternity , " says it .	-7.3703
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would be " persecuted " by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or a aunt for his children .	-4.4114
" No more to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-14.0825
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-3.3597
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-1.5683
The case attracted national attention after Carter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .	-3.0422
" Stop up , spring from a building , cry yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-10.9758
In the moments of suicide , she wrote : " You must do it , Conrad " and " Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . "	-4.5039
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from any press . , . , . . , . . , . . . . .	-8.9867
The case has shared legal opinion .	-2.0040
One of the few who defended Carters was Amanda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder on her British counterpart in Italy before she was released two years ago .	-4.6570
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-2.6470
Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the new mini-Lahm of FC Bayern	-4.2745
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was a captain at the Audi Cup .	-3.1734
FC Bayern mourns a big season for the Confed-Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .	-6.5473
Something was different in his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kimmich immediately , even if the extra garment was very small .	-3.9246
But , since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer was seen , he made his commitment to the arm .	-6.9550
" The trainer did not announce it " , the Confed-Cup-winner after his first bet as Bayern-Kapitän .	-5.1511
Well , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-4.3664
But the sign of the coach was able to interpret Kimmich .	-4.1458
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as the leader of youth players , debutants and especially from their holidays .	-6.9461
Sugar sugar is best distributed to those who want to eat much to eat .	-8.4333
So anyone who has been chosen to take the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-5.8805
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : take responsibility ' .	-3.6301
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old fled as a mini-lawn over the field .	-4.5454
Right at the back , this is his position , the white bind on the arm did its rest .	-5.3456
And at all , Kimmich played in this startup formation as the one who can best take the ruder .	-7.6984
He gave instructions , tried to steer the unsolicited force .	-4.0926
He had a look for the whole while many others were involved .	-4.9242
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness ( scarcely ) ; Renato Sanches with the help of commencing the Asian trip ( also only limited ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Nikla ’ s Süle with no negative impact in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot .	-9.9829
That , after all , worked very well .	-3.5047
Süle ran next to Kimmich , Rudy in front of defense , both acted sovereign .	-4.3320
The name-occupied Napoli Sturm was often difficult , and also tried to win a few times in the .	-10.0571
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was not ' as we hoped ' .	-3.7271
But he also showed a decent performance during the debut .	-3.6170
Gaming , tempo change : " For this style I was also fetched " .	-5.0824
How uninhabited this Bavarian world is still for new entrants , after the game .	-5.6716
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs , but rather six or seven . . , , , . , . , . . . . ,	-8.5588
Kimmich passed a few tough statements in the back of his new players .	-5.4033
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is left here , I have already noticed .	-5.6284
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game " .	-3.9526
After all , he must no longer teach the new ones .	-3.8531

It was often incomprehensible , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister for Economic Affairs of Rheinland-Pfalz .	-3.9575
This is apparent after more than a year when the new Minister of Economics Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-3.4349
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V question of change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister .	-6.1677
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Unternehmen ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy , which Lemke has all blocked " .	-4.2826
Natus 's largest U-turn is in infrastructure policy : The link between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s priorities .	-6.7663
This year , the ministry hopes for a planning procedure , until 2021 , construction law will .	-5.5921
The Western circumvention of Trier is also a part of the country ’ s plans , which is the and needs of the Federal .	-6.9520
The goal is to start the route in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-4.5897
Natus sees this as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.5815
The Chamber of Commerce ( IHK ) Trier strives , as suggested by Wissing , an Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that has been declining for ten years .	-5.5053
Moreover , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , the IHK .	-4.5470
The craftsmen ’ s Chamber Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-4.5032
A premium of EUR 1000 for the completed master exam and EUR 2500 if graduates are self-employed within ten years after the master training .	-8.1405
However , the country ’ s home tax list remains a long time .	-7.9700
In the planned road construction , facts quickly , but at the same time , the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , chief executive of IHK Trier .	-7.8549
Of 56 new engineers who want to employ mobility at the state company , only 29 posts have been occupied .	-6.5931
The IHK calls for more orders to external offices .	-2.1893
CDU group vize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than EUR 20 million in 2017 and 2018 less in the maintenance of national roads than proposed .	-5.8306
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-4.5547
It is also sobering in the country so far .	-5.4503
In 2016 , regional companies had evaluated net supply only with the note 3.4 in an IHK survey .	-3.7645

Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash reaction .	-4.0350
One day before Audi ’ s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-3.0637
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-5.6202
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-3.2935
None of the companies described the undertakings as a call back .	-4.0155
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon emissions rules .	-3.1156
But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.2157
The cost of car manufacturers to install plants to neutralise exhaust gases from diesel vehicles are also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.4849
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.5721
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen ’ s mistakes , which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested but are reduced in normal driving conditions .	-5.3537
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged and others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.2648
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.6695
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition , and could be brought to justice in the United States .	-10.7880
Earlier this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to bypass emissions legislation in Europe , and a question focused on the United States has been extended .	-4.4661
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profits .	-4.9949
That message came on Saturday on the Isar	-8.0217
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.9390
In order to ensure that the Isar visitors also participate , there will be a floss through Munich , which has a special message .	-8.2475
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday , you will see a big floss between Flaucher and Reichenbach Bridge .	-5.3875
And this is not a usual exercise , with Isar tourists .	-4.4822
The building reference will be made to clarify .	-6.0191
On the end you see a big information transparent .	-4.7877

Mordillo ’ s Knollennasen and the Laughter of Unease	-5.7300
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoons , the nolls of his characters .	-5.6742
Even with 85 the Argentine is still drawing and works on a film .	-4.9583
His message : laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-1.9889
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.6796
In the first years he performed as an artist , among other things , as a draftsman for greeting cards , which frustrated him .	-11.1393
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he said once .	-1.9603
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he achieved the breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in the " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-5.2357
Even in China Mordillo found many fans .	-2.9337
Time and again the artists of cities were inspired .	-4.6617
Large , roundabout murdillo figures are melting in drawings with the shielding tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .	-6.4115
In the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.5910
With calendars , puzzles , books for large and small , T-shirts , loops and watches , their drunk figures continue to be spread worldwide .	-6.8458
For six years he has worked on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures .	-4.1535
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a Giraffe - Mordillo 's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand pounds as an opponent .	-4.8969
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which was supposed to come to the cinema wall in 2019 .	-4.6103
" I do not know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-1.8193
The script is not written by him .	-2.0681
That is why he is more likely to rely on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced . , , . , .	-11.1603
Dangerous Lavender from Provence	-3.8749
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-1.9018
Lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and insects communicable diseases , causing great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.4000
Eric Chaisse , an expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-5.1779
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender .	-2.2521
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf caves , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-5.5125
And there is a lot at stake .	-1.7404
Lavender löl not only attracts tourists , but also for perfumes and cosmetics .	-3.8449
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ohren with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-3.2920
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-1.9189
The solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing the evaporation from the soil , but also spraying plants with a protective mix of sound and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness .	-5.3240

The murder of a journalist highlights Mexico ’ s growing threat in Mexico	-2.8855
The Riodoce weekly workers meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in Sinaloa State by organised crime , corrupt officials , and constant drug wars .	-4.9797
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.1086
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.1314
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into office , who were the target of an attack in 2009 or leave them at home .	-5.6486
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutrality , allies .	-3.9043
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and feelings .	-4.0766
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s salary or cartels , a catalogue of criminals that make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous .	-4.2965
There is no rest from violence , and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are in the process : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 . 589 are following attacks and threats under federal protection , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-7.0144
Among the latter , their editor and inspiration of Riodoce , the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-2.7114
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " wrote Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .	-3.2260
His absence is deeply felt even though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " , hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-6.0580
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their divided topics , trauma , their nightmare , paranoia .	-2.5242
Although a special office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings .	-5.3235
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ’ murderers are rarely tried .	-3.3532
At Riodoce , they are still insisting on treating Sinaloa ’ s violence , even though they are more rumors .	-4.6464
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security , says Ibarra .	-2.7826
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.4741
'As long as we do not know why , we distrust everyone . . . , . , . . , . , .	-6.8350
On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-3.3900
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with " Twelve River " .	-7.2620
The shooter went away in his car and damaged it near .	-4.1606
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.4743
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.0148
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan .	-1.5829
But there is virtually nothing but silence on Valdez .	-2.5679
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , because rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-2.7844
It does not make sense that in Sinaloa , someone or more people are shot on the street every day , or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two-storey mausoles for drug kings , larger than many houses for the living .	-6.2529
Forget for one minute that there is a state of ' peace ' if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-3.9120
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , broke with the blame for not protecting his friend .	-3.5495
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder .	-1.3779
First , in February , an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-2.9138
This publication may have annoyed the sons , believing Gangmite members bought every copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kioske .	-5.6245
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the seizure of another newspaper that published the same story .	-3.5332
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-1.8021
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.0529
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce and sold 50 U.S. dollars .	-4.8365
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the problem of drugs , " said Bojorquez .	-2.5737
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-3.4963
Reporters loved to publish tough investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dared to treat .	-3.7258
Eight years after Riodoce , she received the prestigious Maria-Moors Cabot Prize for her coverage in Latin America .	-2.8509
In the same year , Valdez won the Committee 's International Press Freedom Award for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .	-4.9454
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-2.2114
" I want to live , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.1866
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV .	-1.9601
" You must take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb .	-5.2151
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what happened ? '	-8.1731
Valdez , the Riodoce team missed Valdez , who was able to flood like a dock worker , the friend who was generous with impoverishment and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-5.8216
They trusted on his routine .	-2.5383
He would always wear his hat .	-2.0431
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-2.6878
Now they ask : was his love for routine his abduction ?	-4.1831
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do their work and remain alive .	-4.3885
" You don 't like it if you deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways , " to get drugs .	-6.3276
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.1532
The result is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.3132
Trust his own instincts .	-1.5790
If it is wrong , stay away from it .	-3.7009
The anger is , said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier . "	-3.1845
The old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sinaloa , as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials .	-3.5528
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.2487
In the space where Riodoce employees met for security training , no mobile phones were allowed to watch journalists and activists in Mexico .	-4.3208
Two policemen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-2.1787
They were mandated by the government to protect Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle class of Culiacan .	-3.5066
Half in joke , some reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 % of policemen who the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-4.4850
It has been months since reporters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto controlled .	-4.4236
For this week 's edition , Riodoce has seen three main stories .	-3.7920
There was the murder of the brother of former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.0979
They also had an exposé to government spending that focused on the hometown of the governor .	-3.8102
And there was a group that carried out kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-3.3270
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so caution was needed when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.5965
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .	-3.4921
Recently , several PRI governors have been accused of corruption .	-2.8554
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of El Chapo Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.4516
Just a few months earlier , readers would have seen Valdez 's column as the best informed source of abduction .	-3.4623
" We had already known what happened , " Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slender body-stature .	-3.8890
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken up . "	-2.9618
The Valdez office has been transformed into a storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because employees have become something they never had expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-5.0996
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snaped a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-5.4242
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.7549
A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.4547
Across the country , journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " at walking paths and buildings .	-4.6621
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-3.7222
At a meeting with the Sinaloa Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them kill because they told the truth .	-4.7587
Since then , she has asked for it to be re-divided by the government because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity .	-4.4380
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved in it and an equal society .	-4.4514
In his last book " Narco-Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were stuck in a ceiling with organised crime .	-5.4533
The media Guardian Group " Articulo 19 " has assigned more than half of the attacks on police and officials last year .	-3.6612
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.7684
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.1083
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.1984
Your body was found together with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta Kartell : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-3.1491
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head .	-3.1872
Some branches have chosen to close , such as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-3.0671
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its director in 2004 .	-2.6510
In 2010 , Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the front page with the heading ' What do you want from us ? '	-5.2709
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .	-2.7969
It is a painful decision .	-0.8199
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-3.1174
And sometimes they are hunted , as appears to the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-4.4141
For those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-2.3018
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , admits that drug trafficking is frightening him .	-2.5118
" Mexico goes hell , and so I became a reporter , " he said .	-2.4022
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to summarise .	-5.1442
A series of shootings with bandenrivals and security forces near the Mazatlan had left 19 dead dead .	-4.8118
The war continued escalated , as promised by a number of cartel armies in the region .	-2.9212
From the Bordstein edge they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone .	-4.4194
The front page had to be changed the next day .	-2.1208
Sirenen took place near - another shooting in the area .	-4.8011
Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept guards to see if they were ready .	-3.5384
If they were afraid , they did not show it .	-2.9901
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa , the Riodoce employees followed his tracks .	-5.4077
'How can you remember to close , " said Bojorquez said , " if on the same day when Javier was murdered , the practitioners asked me to send them to the streets for reporting ' .	-5.5444
Dinosaurier used to evade his enemies .	-3.2259
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a terrifying one .	-2.9297
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian mining worker were so well received that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs " .	-4.7446
It was so well received that they could even find that his shoppy skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a " restless past " .	-5.8726
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " described it as " the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur copies of the world " .	-4.6945
The Fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the .	-3.4237
His incredibly well preserved state has astonished researchers who describe it as ' really remarkable ' , ' .	-5.2096
According to reports in National Geographic , the carnivorese is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-4.6864
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North of Alberta , Canada .	-9.9090
He met with something that seemed missing from the surrounding rocks and decided to look more closely .	-3.7278
The fossils he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology .	-2.4968
They spent the next six years on revealing the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) of heavy earth .	-5.1315
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.6059
" If you blink just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible .	-4.6909
'It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs ' .	-4.5218
Researchers have found that , even though it is covered with armor and similar to a changing tank , it was probably threatened by meat dinosaurs .	-4.4129
The strongly armored dinosaur used a red and white camel to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as counterburial coat used by many modern animals .	-6.0958
This would have allowed to mix better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-4.9763
The Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.8807
Researchers have now studied the wild animal , and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exploring it carefully .	-4.1470
The amazing conservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-4.1719
They discovered contention , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.2221
Although contention is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds those of today living .	-5.1296
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival .	-4.3930
But most contemporary animals using countershading - think of Rehe , Zebras , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real battle for survival .	-6.3265
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive , heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous dinosaur predators must have been , " Brown said .	-4.7729
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.4769
Scientists continue to investigate the animal of evidence of his life , including his conserved intestines , to find out what it eaten as his last meal .	-4.8252
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , went into a river and was driven into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea .	-10.3000
At that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today , and rivers and oceans are likely to be much further inland than they are today .	-3.9473
" This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scalp , but it is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal , " said Brown .	-8.5888
" The result is that the animal looks almost as in the early chalk period .	-3.8250
You don 't need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it ; if you shoot a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it is on sleep . '	-7.0765
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs .	-4.7449
Although the king of them , Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was driven by some of his terrible ancestors .	-3.4387
The Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-2.7865
Scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology magazine , believe that Borealopelta was sinking in the sea after death and mumified in the mum .	-7.4613
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray , north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.3556
According to the museum , it is the best-preserved armored dinosaurs of the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from sneak to the hip .	-4.9788
Creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.0989
It contained two 20-inch peaks that stood by his shoulders .	-4.0217
Researchers believe that Western Canada ’ s carnivorer was blown up until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-5.9683
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail .	-4.0049
The preserved remains of this special specimens are so well preserved that the skin remains hollow panzer plates along the dinosaur plates along the din.	-7.4770
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as ' rare as a profit in the lotto .	-2.6086
The more I look at it , the more confusing it .	-1.7276
Versteinerte remains of the skin still cover the holy panzers that carry the skull of the animal .	-6.1526
His right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are stretched up .	-5.9728

In the Storm : Mass Carambolage to A8 : Many injured	-10.5000
An accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-3.9605
There are numerous injuries , kilometres of congestion and casualties .	-4.6432
Some 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon on the Stuttgart-Munich motorway ( A8 ) .	-4.3965
According to the first police data , at 5 p.m. , between the nobility offices of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district Aichach-Friedberg ) were transported during a thunderstorm .	-8.5092
The exact number of injuries were not provided for the exact number of injuries .	-5.1041
It was easy to medium serious injuries , a police spokesman said .	-4.6959
A large set of rescue vehicles was at the accident centre .	-3.7184
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .	-2.4368
In the direction of Munich , there was a distance of about ten kilometres long .	-7.3109
As an AZ reporter reports , there was also massive obstacles on the counter-carriage - through numerous casualties .	-7.6269
The fire brigade noted the signs of the vehicle drivers , who now have to face severe penalties .	-6.4176
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.5878
This resulted in a collision between a car transporter and a passenger . . , , . , . , , . , . , and .	-9.8149

Deutsche Bahn : Group tests ' Comfort Check-in ' '	-2.8855
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .	-5.7874
Or one is deeper into his work and has just a brilliant idea .	-3.8468
And then : pufff .	-1.3994
When the creator comes and awakens an impatient or rides the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-6.2797
Ticket control .	-2.6731
But the periods of interruptions are soon over .	-2.9383
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the crewless ticket control .	-3.7184
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and devalues the ticket .	-4.7248
Currently , a test operation is running on two routes .	-3.4471
" If the offer , we will extend it .	-4.4215
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany , " said a railway precher .	-5.1663
" Comfort check-in " calls the train card devaluation without creator .	-3.4360
In order to be able to use these , however , some conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .	-5.8757
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do .	-4.4175
You also need to buy it via the train that DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way to book your ticket .	-5.8757
Finally , you need a seat reservation .	-2.7302
Because the " comfort check-in " works like : you get up in the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-5.5667
For the test customers a button for electronic devaluation appears .	-4.1459
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y seat .	-5.2573
When the train attendant at the ticket check in square Y he knows that a passenger with already depreciated online ticket .	-6.5981
So you can rest on sleep , continue working , continue to remain silent .	-6.2022
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for rail - which in turn should use passengers .	-5.1556
" If you want to travel by our train staff without ticket control , simply check in the DB Navigator .	-5.1393
This enables passengers to personalize their travel time in the train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr .	-6.1748
Secondly , " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs ' .	-3.9847
Those who often drive the train will know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , the ticket controls are one of the biggest problems .	-7.5000
It is often the case that one of the participants do not have all the documents needed to devalue online tickets .	-6.1518
Either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document must be presented .	-4.6971
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , resulting in bad mood in the distance or large area and delays in controlling their own ticket and ultimately takes the time to take care of other concerns .	-7.5116
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-1.5663
And this also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-3.2796
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet available .	-3.6318
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-2.0676
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-1.8943
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.8943
She stumbled through a post from someone from the High School .	-1.9341
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street " , said it was there .	-9.2254
Realized because nobody else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.9742
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah has been constantly retrained on their timeline .	-4.1004
The rapper from St. Louis area was killed in the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-7.7339
He posted an image of Brown ’ s lifeless body that was stretched on the street and would stay four hours .	-5.9529
" That is wild " , Ferrell thought Ferrell .	-4.6734
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.8067
She removed her cell phone to return to Tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive .	-5.0246
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and by a man who claimed to be Brown 's father who called a sign with the inscription : " Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-5.8098
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bell-dog .	-4.0491
In another video , she said , another policeman secured his gun and shouted : ' I will kill you ... animals all . '	-3.4552
" This is not customary " , Ferrell remembered her statement .	-3.0163
'This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical ' .	-3.8153
At this moment I felt shocked .	-3.3469
I was angry and crying ' .	-1.5424
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-2.1947
After landing at 23 o 'clock , she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-5.2425
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film , " Whose Streets ? " , in cinemas from 11 .	-3.3911
It is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people living in the Community and filled the streets to demand answers .	-6.8293
When Ferrell with her daughter , who had a flower dress and a suitable crown , went to Ferguson , the two talked about a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about black experience and black state « .	-6.3295
" You remember how I taught you , when black people must fight for what they believe in ? " she reminded you of what she said .	-5.0533
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-2.6843
I could not take them , " said Ferrell later .	-2.7212
" What has happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past . .	-8.7676
She must know and see it and be raised in it .	-3.7697
It must be well developed , not only know activism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to free ourselves .	-3.8372
Although I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience glaring racism , she is no different from the next black women .	-5.5797
I feel I would do her a disservice to keep her away from it . '	-3.9042
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a campsite when the activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson .	-5.1460
Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .	-3.5250
They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-1.9259
Slowly , a new type of activism began to take shape .	-2.3944
" My activism changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.4892
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.2816
Everything has come . '	-2.2158
Weekly later , Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-director of the film .	-8.6293
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what happened .	-2.2648
A question came into mind : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? '	-9.5378
This skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people , often by white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.4394
As Folayan recently stated in an interview , ' We had heard that people born and grew up in Ferguson did not centralise their voices and we wanted to do it differently . '	-3.7308
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death tract .	-4.2744
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-5.1973
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us .	-2.9613
'That was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because I will be presented ' .	-4.7069
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell ’ s experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messias leader but a community coming together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.6116
As a result , documents of " Whose Streets ? " surprising personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she loves and marry her wife .	-4.0010
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-1.8492
'But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and the humanisation of black people . '	-4.0574
Moreover , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-matter movement .	-2.5956
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin ’ s black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .	-3.9520
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-4.4816
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.2639
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.8038
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film .	-3.5394
" She was the person who shattered this energy " , she said .	-7.1960
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life at these crossings as a black , gay woman is at stake .	-4.7210
You can feel your energy through the screen . '	-2.1395
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue .	-4.0121
Ferrell is on currency for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.3376
She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-3.5992
However , she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-5.8802
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.9068
It is our duty to win .	-1.2466
We must love and support each other .	-0.9812
We have nothing to lose - except our chains ' .	-1.5707
From " Dream " to " Size " : TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery " .	-4.9118
The Bit Gallery moves people , although it is far from built .	-3.4569
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone divides since the first presentation in 2009 , the population in supporters and opponents .	-4.1117
Kalt leaves the subject .	-4.5753
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.8756
While some say to the Bit Gallery say : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be real class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , comes from the other side : " Do not need man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Size ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.0703
While supporters rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , as well as the rest of business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bloom .	-7.2799
In addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the property where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-4.7586
This will end with the start of the construction work .	-3.6560
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with possibility to sit outside .	-5.1355
Simone Room : " We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years .	-4.3299
Most of our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women .	-5.8266
We have also discovered the butcher for us .	-4.2258
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-3.9062
There are other cities .	-2.9683
The small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . "	-2.6290
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers in a market hall in the gallery , comes at the level of the rent .	-5.1767
This is unlikely to be low in the new project . '	-4.7294
Eva Kilic : " Wozu Shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.2453
Whether clothing , shoes , drugstore or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-4.0418
There is enough of this in our city .	-2.8698
You can see how many shops are empty - some for months and years .	-3.6723
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall .	-3.9198
After all , the goods offered are fresh , are mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive .	-5.2894
As you can see , shop shops are only rented by larger companies , because the rents are often not acceptable to a retailer .	-7.1087
It is a pity , special shops are almost no longer available and what remains of it will probably disappear . '	-10.7124
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .	-2.0850
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-1.7916
Above all , where should the farmers ' market hall during the construction period ?	-5.1722
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term if the bit gallery actually comes .	-3.9848
Or does the ghost Bit Gallery before releasing all shops from Bitburg ? '	-4.9761
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-1.8867
And there is no need for a shopping centre that is empty .	-8.1826
In my view , it would have been better to promote a proper farm market rather than this gallery .	-3.6374
But for a farm-market hall , thanks to the insane many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-6.2531
If the farmers ' market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . '	-7.3744
A matching similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-2.2986
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost unimaginable - attached to cable on the ceiling .	-4.3309
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from chelsea Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-2.7491
Manning sent the sections from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publicly publicly disclosed diplomatic information about WikiLeaks .	-5.9930
The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A Successful similarity ) .	-3.6504
It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline combined expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and Manning , a transwoman and landmark dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-4.7064
Dewey-Hagborg has developed through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits , what someone could look with these genomic data , but also an intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity .	-6.9373
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has openly spoken about identification as a woman since her puberty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six breaches of the espionage law , computer fraud , and theft .	-4.3122
The prison was suppressed by her image , so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black and white selfie , in which manning appears insecure on a driver 's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig with which she was associated .	-8.7453
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012-project Stranger Visions .	-3.0296
In that , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette stumbles and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like .	-4.9636
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.1364
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.3660
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.9110
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal correspondents who exchange several letters over two years .	-4.9532
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-3.5550
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-3.8198
There is also something low and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informers from the government camp and transgender troops to find new , tweet-capable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he should actually fix .	-6.2575
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a particular reason " .	-2.6023
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for her oversized signature ( the " i " in her family name has a heart ) , an end to the " automatic fragmentation based on sex , race , sexuality and culture . "	-7.0077
On the opposite wall , her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and G and As , is written in pencil .	-4.3112
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucleotide after the advanced scientific dictionary of the artist ) , Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-4.7257
" What people hope will take with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also visible .	-4.1228
'DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . "	-2.8116
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the aforementioned comic novella .	-5.3486
She shows manning how she emerges with a hands-on phone in her hand from the disciplines of the United States like King-Kong .	-7.1166
" When they cold your speech , they have won , " it says .	-4.4508
" So never stop the mouth " .	-2.4559
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets from Philadelphia .	-2.3455
'I still get goose when I talk about it . '	-2.8679
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , by its own genomic simulacs , which gather together like hordes of Protestants .	-6.8922
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Statur ) , where their genetic haplogy groups were written with pencil .	-5.3486
" In the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.3372
'I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation ' .	-3.4716
Professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford for killing killing .	-8.9662
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are looking for suspects after a man had been raised in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with lethal injuries .	-5.8700
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) Arrest Warren ( 56 ) Arrest Warren ( 56 ) Arrest Warren ( 56 ) were issued for murder of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranleau as .	-4.9280
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several cutbacks .	-2.2609
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Agency states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-3.1733
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-2.5564
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead in the place of the event , and detectives investigate the cutbacks as murder , while the police actively searches for the two suspects , officials said .	-4.7131
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.1344
Alan K. Cubbage , vice president of university relations , said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been vacant and excluded from entering Northwestern University Campus .	-4.0066
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-2.9480
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.1469
A university spokesman and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way . '	-4.8759
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .	-3.5372
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he strongly urge suspects to face the authorities .	-3.7932
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them , " said Guglielmi .	-3.0077
Guglielmi said that local , regional , and national authorities help to find the suspects .	-1.8043
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building age of the Grand-Plaza building , which had just received a mysterious tip that something had happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.8138
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.0628
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-1.9538
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.6050
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.2652
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-4.9532
" We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future " - Russia 's Deputy Prime Minister Mutko Mutko	-3.4899
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) are implemented .	-2.7960
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.3847
The WADA roadmap was updated in this respect , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-1.9683
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for reinstalling RUSADA and recently published on the organization ’ s website .	-3.7631
According to Mutko , it does not contain anything that could give cause for concern to Russia .	-2.8121
" Everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .	-1.9407
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.0470
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-3.7361
With regard to the matter Mutko said : ' We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-4.0884
All measures have been implemented .	-1.1314
But there were no state programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist ' .	-3.2996
Mutko ’ s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov , head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-2.5162
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations , but added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules .	-4.8501
Nobody pretends to accept this report unconditionally ' , Smirnov added .	-3.2083
RUSADA was excluded from implementing doping controls in Russia in November 2015 .	-3.0474
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.1700
After visiting the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving " in the right direction " in order to be reinstated . , , , , , .	-8.5956

She asked people from outside for help .	-2.7652
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.2301
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment , it enables companies to carry out surveys , to address specific groups and demographic groups , provide anonymity and complaints hotlines , and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite executives and directly to the Board of Directors .	-6.2392
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment .	-3.4935
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-4.5105
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card from the company that shows at a glance which units most complaints have and which executives have low approval results - so you can borrow why .	-6.0125
Companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished .	-5.0686
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.6408
Global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let 's Talk Payments website .	-2.6041
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw a rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case .	-4.4000
Convercent has nearly 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.1812
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-1.8513
As Glint , Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made " pulse " surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas .	-4.4459
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can report bad behavior .	-3.0356
And when the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-4.0380
" The court of public opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-2.7418
If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott , employee turnover and complaints , Quinlan said .	-5.2630
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , Convercent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and have a simple way to reach their headquarters .	-5.0921
In the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , and hope that he was taken seriously .	-5.3590
It was often intimidation and inconvenient experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .	-3.0332
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair internships can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-4.2215
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-4.0934
'And we protect our shareholders against employment disputes ' .	-2.8031
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee commitment in 2002 more seriously after the Enron scandal , Arthur Andersen ’ s accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations , Quinlan said .	-5.4963
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from being online .	-5.2076
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.2412
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-3.7013
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds Venture Capital investors who supported both start-ups .	-3.5586
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-3.1580
Glitzers secured $ 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and brought all its funding to $ 60 million .	-2.8540
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.8920
There is a growing research complex that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done .	-4.9100
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes .	-8.3007
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.4003
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs their voices , and that the work you are doing is worth , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.8937
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well when their portfolio companies are running well when employees are engaged and committed .	-5.4944
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.6376
Data on employee commitment according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .	-4.3054
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action .	-3.6705
Indeed , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.5095
And if change is not fast enough , or at all , it can breed disappointments and demotivize employees .	-3.9232
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data .	-5.8119
" Because if you do not follow employees will ask themselves , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.3776
Are you concerned about this ?	-2.8190
And who do not care about why should I ? '	-3.9020
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , has been able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint , so salvation .	-4.2982
And , after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training training to address the problems .	-4.2605
At Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights about employees , and it hopes that , in the long term , this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-5.6022
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.8290
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.5831
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.3887
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins	-3.4297
There is a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the team 's new training fields on the campus .	-5.4667
Some have removed their jerseys and show their back full sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.9326
For a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .	-4.1096
Players entering the summer courses will return to their final exams before returning to the Water Man Football Center at 6 : 30 a.m. the next morning .	-5.9388
" This is a real tretmill for the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday to Tuesday .	-3.7867
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.0933
This is why the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 7.15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players . and , , .	-7.9340
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Moras during the summer school in Westwood .	-6.1530
They are expected to hold 18 exercises during August 20 , before the start of formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-5.5821
Mora said that he support the NCAA change regime , even if they add another point to the multi-faceted routes .	-5.8439
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.4315
" And they simply pushed it through , they are great people .	-3.4523
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-3.5948
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear lines of its fields , from a adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a top-class hotel already covered with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a gate .	-8.0787
Bruin players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .	-3.9819
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.9066
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people hire a room there and then set up to record an exercise .	-4.5177
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is a pretty good business .	-7.6381
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-2.9341
We will do the best to do with what we have . . , . , . . , . . , . , .	-6.8186
I am not worried , therefore .	-3.7322
We have a plan . '	-1.0360
Facebook wants to intensify face-checking in the fight against fake news news .	-4.1844
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reviews from third parties and show their results under the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , and . , and . , , and , and . .	-9.3160
In an opinion on its website , the company said that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible falsehoods and send them to factual auditors who may show results of the fakt test from the original article .	-7.1920
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distributional points for so-called fake news , many of which believe have influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-4.2160
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hasty postings as they did before the September elections . . , .	-5.6759
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.8809
" In addition to recognizing the stories of third-party factual auditors , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-4.8892
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the " related article " and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages .	-4.0039
Creating a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.5008
In its recent past , the small Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.8651
But Scotney has seen 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent , and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-4.7394
" I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says hurry .	-4.1618
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand ' .	-2.4088
' A Castle in England ' covers the period from the Middle Ages to Edward 's age and documents the families living in Scotney .	-15.2047
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally .	-2.6088
" I only responded to the thumbnails on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 's years working for the Jakobiner " , he says .	-5.1229
" That is his thumb pressure !	-2.6612
And letters always smell after smoke , because at that time one fire was lit because of light .	-6.1654
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he was there .	-4.2905
Oh , I love archives ! '	-2.0160
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting " ) all this seems too nice to be true .	-6.0229
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watch the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted Hyänenköpfe on the walls and the bottles that spent centuries in the grave .	-6.4445
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape patrons , gardeners and sometimes with artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-6.3336
Then , at night he trank " whiskey and began writing " .	-2.3872
Scotney 's intimate history is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.7752
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees began to look after the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , put it on the roof . "	-4.9202
Tagebücher , letters from the time of English Empires , maps which represent who owned what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch for the two families fought .	-6.9481
Young , let everything go ! '	-3.5510
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer 's uprising of 1381 .	-4.8177
" There is a record of a revolt that occurred in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.7528
" The farm uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising is a good start .	-3.2911
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-1.8559
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit patron , which the Darrell family hidden for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.5212
Or ' The Smuggler ' , in which Arthur Darrell is depicted from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.9441
The Darrells are Rhodes ’ favorite family of Scotney : " The gentlemen seemed to be a cronies , make debts and spend money on things they could not afford .	-5.8997
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boy , with a talent to promote inheritance . '	-4.7180
After the end of his operation , Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experience .	-5.1068
He passed a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki , the site of a early 20th century sanatorium , which has been recalled by nature .	-5.9465
However , Scotney has a special place for him .	-2.2973
" I was sad to go back , " he says .	-1.2217
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to deal with the damned life ' .	-4.1538
Campaign : Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf	-8.3547
The town of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new roof mark ( Thursday ) on Friday .	-5.8352
Until Thursday Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.5006
At the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Grafenwerth .	-3.2030
" Too good for us .	-1.6894
Or ? " , the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-4.0376
" We do not think that ( of course ! ) do not really think , " they write on their website yesterday .	-5.8480
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.3096
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .	-2.4087
Basically , we firmly believe that , as a Bad Honnefer , we know citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.7431
The action is about more than ' just ' one logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-4.6509
" It is important to make a pledge , one that gives the city a distinctive unique unique feature .	-6.8893
After all , it is in competition with other municipalities .	-2.4156
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign .	-3.5281
Military Reform in Turkey – Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-2.1586
Every year in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on pensions and promotions in the Official Corps .	-4.4382
This week , too .	-7.1283
At first glance , a normal process .	-2.1884
But nothing is routine with Turkey ’ s armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.8682
The sitting was no longer in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .	-4.4628
The five vice-presidents , as well as the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers .	-5.0292
As a result , the YAS civilians were overwhelming .	-5.2000
The government is pulling the reins in the military .	-3.3349
General Secretary Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the army ’ s commanders , the army , and the navy were abandoned .	-6.6974
Since the failed coup , head of state Erdogan has fired off 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-3.4389
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army ’ s ranks – mostly because of alleged connections to the exile prediger Fethullah Gülen , who sees Erdogan as a draftsman of the coup attempt .	-6.1853
There have been negotiations in Ankara since this week against 486 people who are directly involved in the coup attempt .	-5.4303
As early as the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the ' sins gift ' , as he gave him the opportunity to " clean up " the armed forces " .	-7.2217
But does Erdogan really manage the army ?	-2.0288
At the end of February the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unease in the Military Headquarters " .	-2.6582
In general , there are concerns about increasing ' Islamisation ' of the army , which manifests itself , among other things , the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers .	-6.6718
In any case , the large-scale cleansing of the army and the security forces goes on .	-5.2741
In mid-July , Erdogan fired another 7395 officials , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-2.8789
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military .	-3.1427
The generals were earlier than the country ’ s true masters .	-3.4504
On three occasions , they brushed on their role as guardian of the secular state order .	-6.4170
Following his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step , not least in the light of the European Union ’ s reforms .	-4.9172
Former officers say that Erdogan is pursuing Islamization of the armed forces .	-3.3999
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a non-named officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years .	-10.8370
If that happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-3.3983
In any case , there are doubts about the Turkish army 's willingness to act .	-4.5891
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are " weakened , " Nato diplomats .	-3.3707
Washington Changes the Green Card	-1.5265
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , President Donald Trump , cited by the media .	-2.2863
It provides for a reduction in legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules on obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas .	-3.9230
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.7648
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .	-3.0209
'This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars on taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are spent green cards . '	-4.3722
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.1508
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-4.0260
Ministry wants to repair track track for racing huts .	-6.0381
Time and again over the past few months on the future of the race track has been contested .	-11.8156
Before the end of the year , the marod route on which the tourist track will be built .	-6.1436
In order to secure the future of the race lift hut , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin this year .	-6.8017
" With the decision to continue to order and repair the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country is committed to this connection especially important for tourism " , declared Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.2892
The cost of repairing the route was around EUR 2.5 million .	-3.9702
The country accepts 75 % of this sum .	-3.3908
The Treaty on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future , is now being voted definitively .	-5.0583
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .	-4.1311
" This is the roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards " , said Sühl .	-3.3681
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for eleven years .	-2.7294
This will allow the racing shuttle to be regularly ordered on December 2017 .	-5.4218
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a popular rail connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations .	-3.7023
Over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order them in the future .	-5.9824
The track is also heavily burdened in parts .	-4.9580
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about .	-2.5139
Just when you thought that it could not become more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the sex robots .	-4.1634
Yes , indeed .	-0.9360
Sex-robots are now a big thing .	-1.8878
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.0337
According to Noel Sharkey , a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University , and co-founder of FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-3.2980
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the chest warts and the type of fingernails .	-4.2516
" People are funny about them , but companies provide a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , " said Mr Sharkey said when he published his new report .	-6.5733
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-5.4186
The user can also " customize " his robot according to his convictions , selecting everything from the eye color of the robot , the shape of the chest warts to type or color of his fingernails .	-6.6734
But it becomes even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " who would make a stepfor-woman look progressively .	-4.1658
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone .	-2.4135
For example , the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find more appealing , such as shocking .	-5.1815
And then there is the Roxxxxxy Gold Sex-robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of intimacy and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-4.6949
" Roxxxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality , " blows the website of True Companion .	-3.5366
So she likes whatever you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc .	-3.0085
During the day she also has her mood - just like real people !	-4.3930
It can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can be " in mood " ! "	-3.7265
There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the subservient female characteristics , the allusions to rape when one step on Frigid ( i.e. defiant ) Farrah , cause one concern most .	-6.8380
On his website True Companion Roxxxxy compared with a Vibrator , but for men .	-2.1934
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have a roxxxy ? " says it on the website .	-4.0208
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys .	-3.5429
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional addition .	-5.6383
Most men will , of course , not hold sex robots , and while FRR notes its rising popularity , they remain provisionally on the margins of consumer culture .	-4.7132
But what leaks out of the periphery can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live .	-6.8018
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission .	-7.9538
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots are appearing at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who has ironed women sexually assaulted .	-5.1133
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphic images , the winding bodies and the eyes of the eye , but how realistic this vision works .	-6.6253
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-2.9296
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with porn proportions ) .	-3.4992
Their builders want to feel human beings , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-3.4321
But , when it comes to their " personalities " , robots are not real women .	-3.0712
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply go away .	-4.0153
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjection .	-4.2616
In other words , they are good slaves .	-1.3734
Or to put it in the 2017 Speech : Female	-5.5081
Trump ’ s great achievement ?	-1.3547
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense of common sense . , .	-3.9590
It has become a truthfulness of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have divided into small size families .	-4.4686
Around Christmas and Erntedankfest , there were newspapers in the US about how to deal with Trump ’ s horror .	-3.5318
We are all supposed to get our filter bubbles .	-3.4710
Less notice has been the power of Trump to bring families together .	-2.5192
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.2144
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.9935
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows it , including the Republican kinship with whom she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and strange on the same side .	-5.3165
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks .	-5.9394
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but his presidency ’ s apparent effect has the power to put us all right .	-4.9289
When we talk about " normalization " and Trump , we refer to the gruesome possibility that his armies will no longer destroy us .	-6.2534
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “ normalizes ” Republicans who suddenly appear as an epitome of sensible relative to its standards .	-5.5677
Today , I find myself struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urcomic version of crazy - the dog on the car roof , which 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) - both of which , in fact , appear to be very mild offence compared to Trump .	-6.7833
When Trump goes , the Republican candidate must only be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.8722
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel at Central Park , the largest of New York Park Carousel , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-5.2735
The horses are huge , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crazy and the animals twist to look at their own shoulders - extremely finest and climate-friendly music conveys this in a strange way .	-7.6557
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not justice to the dream .	-3.3783
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not entirely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in northern London .	-5.4882
The Central Park Carousel , however , is still a strange magical experience , as two two-year old , an 11-year-old and two women can go to it in the 40 ’ s years and all have a great time .	-7.1000
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-3.9131
On the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-3.6703
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the carpet .	-6.0246
This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but it also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed .	-5.5953
The poor woman in the department was apologetic to grinsend , while I was tired of getting my credit card with five stars .	-7.1455
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with breast aches .	-7.5446
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit .	-1.9754
Last year , he was brought to hospital for treatment of cuts in his hands , according to the prison authorities after a case in his cell .	-4.9580
Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder after an appeal by the .	-5.3191
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of the Valentinstags in 2013 by shouting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-4.8673
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightmare who hid in the cabin .	-4.8757
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-4.9879
The National Law Office said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year .	-4.1479
Pistorius runs the risk that his penalty will be increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful .	-9.2995
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7163
As a Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg .	-2.6947
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the four plaintiffs from Fützen and Epfenhofen were laid off during holidays and in secondary schools .	-6.9935
Three of the disengagement students will go to the gymnasium , four at the Realschule .	-5.3795
The school leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at Biesental in Epfenhofen .	-4.1073
The 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grew up in the chickenerhof , but then released into freedom .	-5.6114
In addition , the muntere Schar introduced a musical entitled " Der Adler im Hühnerhof " .	-6.5327
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , leaving it out of his chickens .	-3.0034
Instead of a chicken breed , a small eagle came out .	-3.2021
But the hope of turning him into a chicken broke down , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain mountain .	-5.4783
After that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank showed a chicken.	-4.1861
The hens danced with the young gockles who played cylinders to the bet .	-4.5758
The adler stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-2.7991
The boy is different from the other young animals ( chicks ) , but is part of it .	-6.3070
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.4691
His provision is to be free .	-7.0869
She wished every four plaintiff that he felt accepted in his new school .	-5.5861
It was followed by thanks to the colleagues , the former head of the school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps in school bottlenecks , and the parents ' representatives .	-9.4258
The cake time is over , explained class-teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.0950
They leave their students very reluctantly after two years of teaching because it was a really great time .	-5.2305
In the end , they have been able to rely on the four-knife barrels .	-6.7815
In conclusion , all students decided to find a song of summer time and holiday time .	-5.3904
The children had great pleasure in doing so .	-4.8175

Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.8288
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .	-3.6471
On the morning of 1 August , police arrested a group of illegal tentative people , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.2688
They were released on the same day , while an investigation is under way .	-3.3226
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later .	-2.1587
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camp and put substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-5.1062
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.1818
The ministry said that the court can impose fines .	-2.5050
Software Update for diesel vehicles : What those affected need to know now ?	-3.8584
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.6177
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?	-2.6977
The most important questions and answers .	-1.8919
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million .	-8.7396
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .	-5.3728
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-2.0824
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives an assessment :	-3.0863
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.3250
No , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .	-1.4653
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have fired software " , says Anja Smetanin .	-4.1862
Its retrofit has ordered the KBA .	-7.6615
How and from when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.3424
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet specified a precise date .	-4.2776
Daimler has informed us to sign any person concerned .	-5.0771
If an inspection is due in any case , it will be done within their framework .	-4.2109
How long should the conversion be carried out ?	-4.7014
" Smetanin says Smetanin .	-2.2291
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and political pressure .	-2.8219
'Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment . '	-4.7498
How long should the update take ?	-2.0675
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.9118
It may be more time to get an appointment .	-3.4756
What do drivers do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.7260
The ACE advises to wait .	-2.5166
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow , Smetanin .	-3.8857
Is a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars ?	-2.4534
ACE fears that .	-1.5149
But precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten .	-3.0947
In rural areas , there is no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.1686
The ACE advises to wait with a sale .	-3.6607
LL Cool J received Kennedy Center Award	-2.0722
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.0012
President Trump ’ s first prize ceremony promises to become political .	-1.5572
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .	-2.6213
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper one of the most sought awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .	-3.1676
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday , the singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) .	-3.5594
The awards will be issued at the beginning of December .	-2.4923
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a welcome and join his wife Melania .	-3.2366
Lear , known with progressive TV series , announced that he would not be participating in the gala .	-6.8227
The ' New York Times ' he said : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of resources - and that is a burden on me ' .	-6.2625
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view .	-3.1684
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.6619
The former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.2808
We make the City Life worth	-3.4954
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city builder will retire next year .	-3.2226
The job is already posted - suitable applicants are rare .	-4.8971
For 31 years Wacker has been a city builder .	-3.5498
And his work still makes him great fun as he conveys in the press interview .	-5.2512
He reports on varied but also challenging tasks that await his successor .	-4.0922
At the same time , he is surprised that no application fulfils the requirements profile .	-3.7951
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible time .	-3.3114
That is how , while respecting the regular termination periods , it should be enough time to deal with it .	-9.8450
Since Haslach acts as a subcontracting authority for the administrative community , the applicant must submit relevant accounts .	-5.7465
Because this function wants to keep the city .	-3.4561
If they were no longer able to fill them , citizens would have to go to Offenburg .	-4.2961
But proximity to the people is important to the city and to it itself , says Wacker , who reports about a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizens .	-6.3698
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated on Wacker .	-4.7873
" We make the city life worth " , he is secure through the building office and its staff .	-5.2450
In the future , however , varied projects are on the agenda : the reorganisation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz square are started .	-8.3499
The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still subject .	-4.1079
The latter alone will beat around EUR 1.5 million , ' if we get it right ' , Wacker estimates .	-5.2177
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.6892
The work here is fun . '	-2.1534
There is a lot of room for a city builder .	-5.0349
With Haslach ’ s own building and gardening , it is possible to react flexibly to many things .	-5.6656
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-5.5851
Since the old town is an ensemble under protection of monuments , it is important to have an eye for what is purified " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing town builder .	-7.5683
In any case , the mayor bears a heavy responsibility .	-4.3846
He is a builder , ' at the end everything goes over my table ' .	-4.6308
He can count on many years of staff and coordination : Markus Neumaier ( building ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( Tiefbau ) for 15 years .	-6.4822
Also that his successor remains a long time , Wacker wishes : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place ' .	-6.8549
Because continuity is important not only for a good business climate , but also for the further development of the city .	-4.1222
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker , you should be able to perform a completed study as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning law .	-8.5145
The City Building Office is subject to construction and underground construction , building management planning , basic employment matters , management of urban properties , city office with Bauhof and Stadtgärtnerei as well as underground construction law , including monument protection .	-10.6562
Cycling on lines : South Railways closed .	-8.9608
According to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway track in the area of Leobener Street ( B116 ) on the lines .	-10.3189
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-4.7108
The investigators depart from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night .	-4.3267
Nearby witnesses a rosaroter roller and a bicycle rider were observed .	-6.0686
" This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich " , said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch to APA .	-2.5732
The perpetrators would have put themselves at great risk and endangered train traffic .	-4.8870
In addition to the damage caused by the locomotives , the delay and the cost of rail replacement transport , the paedophiles of railway customers could also be assigned to the perpetrators .	-8.5129
The speaker said .	-1.7887
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon and rail transport on the southern railway route could be carried without any obstacles .	-6.3147
Almost ten passenger trains had been dropped on Friday morning , two of them related to long-distance traffic .	-5.5107
Freight trains did not fall , but they had delay .	-3.2085
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch , about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be exchanged .	-3.1006
Isolators and masts have also been damaged .	-1.6147
Red meat , milk products , and chocolate could help alleviate IBD ( inflammatory disease ) .	-2.7203
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.5156
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory disorders .	-3.3554
The incurable state that affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach and vesicles , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-4.6717
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-4.7062
The chief researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immuncells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .	-5.1381
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues .	-2.8665
If the balance tends to inflammation , it may result in an inflammatory disorder .	-3.6911
Experiments found that a kind of tolerance immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intake .	-5.7820
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .	-3.1810
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the Darm microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.3920
The more Tryptophan had had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells " .	-2.7829
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a more tolerant diet , less inflammatory intestinal intestinal , if the same system worked in humans .	-5.2945
The postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immunization that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was housed separately , did not .	-6.5892
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestine robioms of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach tract .	-6.3567
The dams of the mice were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria found in mice with the immune cells , but without the mice .	-4.8320
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so they lacked a intestine robiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells .	-6.1356
To understand how bacteria had an impact on the immune system , researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a fluid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without bacteria - to unmature immune cells isolated by the mice .	-5.7938
The immune cells developed to tolerate cells .	-7.3869
When the active component was cleaned , it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan-metabolism known as Indol-3 milk acid .	-4.0718
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 % , but when the Tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.0521
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach tracts .	-2.5283
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to Tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory disease .	-3.7671
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.3295
potent tryptophane values in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population . "	-6.0495
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic " .	-3.3829
At Manchester United has signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes , after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria .	-4.1776
The £ 40 million signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the Holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will .	-5.0423
Matic had been excluded from the Blues Preparatory Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season .	-4.3555
" He takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.5003
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later ' .	-2.9534
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season .	-3.8929
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to meet three of his four priority commitments .	-4.2552
" To get three out of four , I thank the association " , he added .	-3.9230
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . "	-7.4918
Boeing " Malt " Dreamliner in the He	-5.8192
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-3.0667
The pilots fled from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in the US State of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA , which is several thousand kilometers .	-7.6409
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.4537
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner .	-3.5715
The whole was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.0327
Boeing had already made such advertising .	-2.5944
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .	-3.2773
New Upgrading for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem with a problem	-6.8572
As the wind turns : when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , Social Democratic Prime Minister always looked after Berlin with some concern .	-4.6485
Not a disturbing fire from the party ’ s central party , just no headwinds – the most important desire of the campaigners .	-7.8046
Since Martin Schulz leads the party , that has changed radically .	-2.6494
Since then , the Willy-Brandt House employees have been watching the events in the SPD-governed capitals .	-5.3360
What Schulz received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described with headwinds .	-3.2182
They were deep .	-3.1804
One after another .	-2.1640
After the surprising end of the red green majority in Lower Saxony , the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens .	-4.6837
" This shows once again : Red green can simply not govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.1639
Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .	-2.8374
Five months before the country election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP opposition .	-3.0931
The founder of the German Federal Chancellor Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway low-Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate .	-7.0864
Transgression to the CDU means a clear mistrust of the electorate .	-3.9309
Elke Twesten must return their mandate immediately , " said the Federal Managing Director and Electoral Campaign Director of the Greens to the editorial Network Germany ( RND ) .	-6.2997
" That must not be true , " a SPD campaigner when the new hio message reaches the party centre on Friday morning .	-6.7939
Stephan Weil , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands to the CDU without a majority of his own government .	-10.3605
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD counties .	-3.5770
And nobody knows what happens next .	-2.1328
The plight began with the unexpectedly marked defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-2.9592
A blue eye , no more , did the comrades at the time .	-4.4883
After the country elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.5979
That became the case - and everything became much worse .	-5.6368
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln , and the Dusseldorf bankruptcy .	-4.9011
The comrades were quick to get back in the weeks afterwards .	-6.5520
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg .	-4.1484
And with him the next downfall .	-2.9507
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus this weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-3.6110
And because he then made quite quite wrong in crisis communication afterwards .	-6.0319
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-1.7365
Stephan Weil .	-2.5042
Because of the VW exhaust gases and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has long been in criticism .	-5.1592
Miese surveys were added .	-2.1622
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because , in recent weeks , it has tried to set the accent in the covenant .	-7.5876
The former mayor of Hanover ’ s desire to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the vicinity of Martin Schulz .	-5.7823
They allowed him because they promised to stabilize the party .	-2.7824
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.5787
Because the partisan strife of the Lower Saxony Greens does not actually blame .	-5.6479
And Schulz certainly not .	-2.4270
For the time being , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-9.2846
Her anger is directed at the Greens , and here above all , to the dismal parliamentarian Twesten .	-6.2163
" It is intolerable and democratic , as Mrs Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of everyone else " , says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.9612
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but via the national list of the Lower Saxon Green .	-5.7320
The logical consequence would be to give back its mandate .	-2.8994
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestag , laments an " undemocratic maneuver " .	-2.9387
" The willingness to vote four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as the top candidate in the federal election , the RND .	-5.4130
" Now , the personal careers of a future CDU MEP distorts the election result , " said Oppermann said .	-3.9389
He asked to clarify the background .	-2.8578
I want to know whether more has been there or there has been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony .	-3.4711
Aid for Ortskern III	-3.5422
Anyone who wants to renovate his house in the years will soon be able to receive support from the country .	-5.5764
On Wednesday , Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG City Development on Wednesday in Empfingen .	-4.5720
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler gave a look at what has happened so far .	-3.6490
Since 1991 , there have been rehabilitation areas in the .	-8.0647
At that time , in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding .	-4.5138
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsidy was 60 % .	-3.8449
For Schindler , the remedies to date are a " success project " - it is important to promote internal development too , and not just to open up new areas . . , , , .	-11.2565
On 4 April , the government Bureau of Karlsruhe received information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-5.3350
The funding was EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would be from the country , and the rest of the municipality of Empfingen .	-5.2214
How is a remediation area ?	-3.6682
You will continue to investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-4.8196
But it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area .	-4.0104
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be postponed again .	-4.5142
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-1.8314
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder program " Soziale Stadt " , which would then be carried out .	-5.6443
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of urban cities , improving housing and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .	-4.8492
The measures would be carried out object-related , that is , per plot .	-8.0763
The recovery area would then be defined as a statute .	-4.2123
The eligibility period for funding is under way until 30 April 2026 .	-4.2332
However , until September of this year , the inventory would be carried out in which those involved in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire for filling out .	-7.0081
In November or December , the decision on the Statute should be made , as possible , so that the remedies can be started next year .	-6.6797
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .	-4.4584
It is a question of assessing urban maladministration and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent .	-5.0027
It will also be registered for the respective property .	-6.2004
Pietzschmann will come back to Empfingen and make an image of the situation , she promised .	-4.8044
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .	-3.7169
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up by the end of the summer holidays .	-4.9223

Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and pointer and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by BioTeq company .	-4.9709
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson , an advising anaesthesist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-4.0851
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-3.1949

The White House ’ s Advertising Cost Thousands Thousands of Tax	-5.4972
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers taxpayers up to $ 24,000 according to the military left to TIME magazine .	-4.5693
The green white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.7085
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour through products from all 50 countries .	-2.8594
The Connecticut helicopter manufactured in Connecticut , was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine , a Wisconsin firefighter and a Mississippi forklift truck .	-6.9042
The White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , following the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-4.0691
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility " , the commander of HMX-1 wrote to his supervisor , on the eve of the event to his supervisor , the Deputy Navy commander for aviation .	-5.3670
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 a.m. on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and remained until the lawn was cleared this evening between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 p.m. .	-6.0413
The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second team would be required to return flight due to the restriction of hours .	-5.8947
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time .	-4.6843
The records made available by TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was required .	-4.2813
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes .	-2.2478
rows indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the rule .	-3.5509
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-3.4036
" Klingt as if you are closed " , the deputy commander replied .	-3.9408
The " Made in America " was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-3.6752
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.9092
At the event , the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he advocated efforts to curb government rules .	-10.7115
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.4919
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.2894

Trump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential plane was carrying out taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential .	-5.6275
" The White House is thrilled by the show " Made In America " - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials " , said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-4.7671
HMX 1 crews often perform training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to assess the US president at the White House with precise centimetres .	-5.1181
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House .	-2.7183
The flight for the " Made in America " event was in the training needs of the crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-5.0276
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-2.8972
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden for none of the other requirements presented at the event .	-3.2018
A Speaker of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-2.9911
HMX-1 does not have budget designations for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-4.1056
According to the hourly rates of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year , however , the DoD refund rate for the VH 3D is $ 24,380 per hour .	-5.1964
The unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-4.6155
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter operating costs are far below that rate .	-3.3550
" Setting the cost of taxpayers based on estimates of reimbursement rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-4.5630
'These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds ' .	-2.8752
According to a 2015 RAND study , the doD ’ s reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance , and contract conclusion .	-6.8962
At that time , former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the helicopter ’ s use for the event .	-3.4266
" The idea is to present things this week produced in America , " said Spicer .	-2.7521
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it .	-2.8240
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.5756
It is , of course , appropriate to highlight this . '	-3.0337
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his round of South Lawn for the event , but he sat in the driver ’ s seat of a fire-fighter car .	-5.2502
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked the media about his own fleet of company products .	-3.3026

How America Can Damage OMV	-3.0552
Donald Trump was not really happy when he put his signature on the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday .	-4.5234

The response from Moscow was also as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US initiative .	-3.5814
After all , the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.0857

Role backward : The city introduces 46 kitchen aids .	-5.0076
The city organizes the Kita-lunchtime again .	-3.0955
With strong contact partners for children and an assignment to the team .	-4.3574
The clock is turned back in the city centre .	-4.7689
As of September 1 , the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban childcare facilities ( Kitas ) .	-6.3466
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Director of Youth Aid , this is good news : ' We have all been very pleased ' .	-4.2185
Cooked is still outside the house : a caterer takes this task and supplies freshly cooked cooked .	-5.5629
The city operates 46 childcare centres in the Krefeld area , where children receive a warm meal at lunch time .	-6.0072
In the past Kitajahr 2800 children were sitting on the tables , and demand is growing steadily .	-6.1621
" Not only children who are cared for 45 hours in the Kita at lunch " , explains Pommeranz .	-4.2682
'The offer also applies in the 35-hour support if children stay until 14 o 'clock ' .	-4.8126
46 part-time staff have kitchen service from 1 September : They warm up the food delivered , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , individually portionate the meal , remove , rinse and clean the kitchen .	-9.1646
" The employees are firmly assigned to a kita " , says Pommeranz .	-2.8699
The size - there are two groups as well as seven-group facilities - determines the amount of hours .	-5.1691
" The kitchen workers are now firmly part of the Kita team , " says Pommeranz .	-4.7158
" So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts " .	-3.2706

For children too .	-1.7820
" They have a known force in the Kita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people ' .	-4.1430
This continuity is important for children .	-1.1671
The cleansing of the kita rooms - so far the job of kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff .	-6.2598
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in terms of cost comparisons between own registry and foreign allocation for the city , and .	-8.8634

GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Affairs Manager will not be able to gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members .	-5.0612
Generations of families have worked here , and the workers are concentrating heavily on the local community and Glasgow area , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation .	-4.7152
Therefore , from the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , the rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a prosperous production presence at McVitie . "	-5.2381

Paris Saint-Germain will not diminish in its pursuit of Neymar after giving a £ 189 million to withdraw its exemption clause , but did they warned Barcelona three years ago before the World Record ?	-6.0177
The sensational approach fueled the transfer window in the summer , because the Ligue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returned for £ 89 million to Manchester United last season .	-4.8845
After finishing , Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world .	-5.2549
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out outside , even though a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to care for him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-5.0289
But was the PSG president warned about this prospect three years ago ?	-3.0856
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club to sign one of the best players from PSG .	-3.6924

But if they try to sign one of our players , it will have consequences . '	-3.1836
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer 's interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti .	-4.4179

Interview : " Domspatzen report discharge the Pope 's brother Georg Ratzinger "	-7.0720
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger .	-3.7583
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.6911
The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to further discuss .	-9.8319
Christian Weisnder , Speaker of the Reform Movement " We are Church " , explained after publication to the German Press Agency , he expects from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emeritized Pope Benedict XVI .	-5.1054
It would be very useful for the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their misappraisal of what happened at that time .	-5.5643
On the other hand , the Vatican Office criticized the fact that ' double standards ' in reporting on violence in domain domains .	-7.2891
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is ' shameful and shameful actions ' , which would have to be punished and prevented in the future , but striking the ' degree of media manipulation ' , the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian Bioethics Committee .	-7.0280
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-4.0396
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk : " You would like to go to the church and this is a dedicated fresco " .	-7.1968
She also pointed out that in her youth , ' beatings had been a quite normal pedagogical means ' to cope with freak children , as I was one .	-7.5587
They would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.3529
In connection with the reports of abuse cases , Pope brother Georg Ratzinger appeared .	-4.9634
The author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the book " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-3.9938
" I must protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he evaluates the results of the final report .	-2.6116
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber by Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment ?	-3.8298
In total 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were sexually abused by attacks , 67 domspatzen were sexually abused by attacks .	-5.4534
In the final report , Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In summary it can be noted that Domkapellmeister R. have used forms of physical and mental violence in many cases .	-4.7865
Particularly with high emotionality , the punishment could also be more severe .	-5.7350
Nevertheless , unlike many others accused , many victims estimate the general humanity of R. R.	-11.6993
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger .	-3.1032
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the " incidents of violence against defendants at the Regensburg Domspatzen " gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-4.1771
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity " .	-2.7743
On the other hand , it also appears to be a choleric and perfectionist , who has often become handful when a dome track did not produce top performance .	-8.7339
How do you consider this final report ?	-1.6048
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger comes in this .	-5.3940
He has just been devoted to eight pages , and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or cooperation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-6.7316
The violence at the pre-school school also took place outside its sphere of scope .	-4.7829
At best , one can accuse him of having learned it too late , or having not taken the first suggestion seriously enough .	-7.9317
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he acted was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - " redemption " , " heavens " and " better world " .	-6.0278
Thus , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent testimony , describing him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as a very good teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and bones , and was always surrounded by children .	-8.5860
Only a minority complained about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which has already led to rage .	-5.0613
He himself admitted years ago , deeply regrets and apologized for that .	-4.5480
In his honor , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s .	-5.7141
Do you know these methods ?	-3.0366
Of course , I think all of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.2757
I , too , experienced this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-4.0173
However , compared to what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence of violence on the pre-school school .	-6.9673
One wonders whether it is not related to his popularity and role as brother of Benedict XVI , that many media . , , , .	-12.1442
Many people who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian pope . . , and . , . . , . . , . . .	-9.7836
The truth is : the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-3.0270
A great deal has been reported in the media on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-4.1002
Will Georg Ratzinger be charged any involvement or complicity in the final report ?	-4.6396
Michael Hesemann : Clearly no .	-1.7926
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Cathedral captain .	-4.0897
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-2.1023
" I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it , " said a deputy for the others , " It was all very embarrassing to me " .	-5.3486
The real problem of informing sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent .	-3.7361
If they did not even entrust to parents and siblings , it is certainly not a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator .	-6.3634
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger ’ s role with regard to abuse ?	-5.4337
Michael Hesemann : A questioned student formulated it so : " Regarding sexual abuse ... see no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator .	-5.8676
I think it ... too is really absurd to assume that it is precisely him ... Buben more penetrating or clearer or even more , than with their parents , boarding guides , trust teachers , etc .	-11.5978
That he talks about sex ... - unthinkable ' .	-3.2421
Thus , the report concludes that the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance , could not be confirmed .	-6.9395
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is to be exempt from any co-visor .	-5.0174
He cannot be accused of not having prevented or brought him to the display .	-5.7216
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these abominable crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-4.0750
In the media , a lot of " violence zessen " at the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-4.9703
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report .	-4.7704
Does he have to live with this charge ?	-2.5821
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed and poured into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.3789
That is , however , an abuse of the report .	-2.8918
In fact , there is a clean separation between the pre-school and the gymnasium of domains , between sexual abuse and violence and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.2447
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades , in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the domain .	-6.1513
The whole terrible caning pedagogy , the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were quite harassed and maltreated and suffered horrific conditions , all occurred on the pre-school school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed .	-8.2653
However , Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium .	-6.8537
On that , as most of the witnesses emphasize , was the topic " preschool " .	-3.9901
One was happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even " paradisic " conditions .	-5.4281
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-2.9361
Michael Hesemann : there was discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-3.8148
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that " many victims estimated the general humanity of R. R. and , therefore , in many cases , even though violence , combine positive memories with him ' .	-7.7589
At most , the accusation of having looked away away .	-5.1077
However , despite all efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported on pre-school conditions .	-4.4293
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then only around 1993 .	-7.4010
Did Georg Ratzinger keep his ears before the conditions ?	-4.3225
Michael Hesemann : No , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-2.9764
In this , he points out that ' caning will continue to practice caning ' .	-4.9562
In view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.3896
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when caning penalties were already banned in Bavaria .	-4.8427
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone of us knows .	-3.9953
It was also difficult for him to assess where the people concerned might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the limit was really exceeded .	-10.7364
However , one cannot say that he has always looked away away .	-3.8692
That is simply not true .	-1.1514
Only in 1980 , caning was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-3.3052
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to the time .	-3.6317
How do you see this ?	-1.5554
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " trap of anachronism " , in other words the danger of judging past moral standards .	-4.8719
The prince is right here .	-2.6051
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which has been vilified at all times and not to what has been hidden in the pre-school of resistance and violence on innocent children ’ s seals .	-8.7376
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .	-4.2529
At the same time , however , I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all of this had nothing to do with him .	-3.4499
His means of disciplining and punishment , that is , earnest and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-5.8351
When physical punishment was then banned , he also strictly adhered to it .	-4.1301
What image of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger for the book " My brother the Pope " ?	-4.7612
Is the subject of caning punishment ?	-3.9316
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict XVI . , tells from his perspective , since the domspatzen played only a secondary role .	-4.8971
Nevertheless , I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.7408
But this must be said once again : without this perfectionism , without calling for unconditional discipline , he would hardly have been able to form an institution of world-class , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-7.4369
With biscuits and bons alone , one makes nonsense singers no big singers and every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-8.0550
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger on her book ?	-4.3435
Michael Hesemann : By working on the book and beyond , I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and always seen as a wonderful , humorous , trustworthy , deeply believable and heartfelt people , from whom one cannot imagine that he could do something to do .	-10.2464
I regularly get in touch with him , 23 years after he was born .	-6.3020
Those who have not forgiven him that he has been strict with them are therefore clearly in the minority .	-9.2979
Most domain names are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music .	-4.4565
And that he always was a good , father-in-law teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but was also a loving respect for which they still stand up today and which they are honouring them .	-9.2837
I would like to make it quite clear once again : everything that is being accused of educating people who were on the agenda at that time .	-7.7775
We can be pleased that we have overcome this time long ago .	-2.9432
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat .	-3.6742
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious .	-2.8905
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.4459
Now , the decency of a 93-year-old man who has gained great merit and without the outside of Bayerns and perhaps Germany , nobody would know the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-6.3681
