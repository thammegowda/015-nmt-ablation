Munich 1856 : Four maps that change your view of the city .	-2.7905
A misleading institution where young people should meet today .	-4.2068
A crypt chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug .	-4.5879
Small gardeners manage the former farmer ’ s land . are . .	-11.3787
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories .	-3.2039
It annoys if maps are not up to date .	-3.1596
Everyone knows that , because the auto navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-5.5460
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas , an offer of the Bavarian Geoportal to the state government , are far from current - but this is precisely why they are very revealing .	-6.6031
Especially if you compare them with current online maps .	-3.2684
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the area of distribution of Merkur in Munich have changed since the 19th century .	-8.7152
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be recognized as such .	-3.2671
For cities and municipalities , more detailed maps , so-called primitive maps , have been incorporated into the large overview map .	-5.9044
According to data from the Bavarian survey management , these were established between 1810 and 1864 and originated from Bavaria ’ s first survey .	-5.6908
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.7089
The French army leader occupied Bavaria from the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-3.7398
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical reception of Bavaria , of course for military purposes .	-4.1649
Although the French troops eventually departed with the peace of Lunéville on February 9 , 1801 , it was the current neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map .	-5.3832
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the " Topographische Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey management .	-3.7456
The Munich Urpositionsblatt ( Urpositionsblatt ) dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian Landesbibliothek .	-4.9181
The comparison between the former and the present is the most impressive of the provincial capital .	-6.3265
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.1206
An example of this is Untersendling , which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.0646
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich-based district 21 years after the map was drawn up in 1877 .	-4.5941
Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city .	-3.0452
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-4.1719
Where the Westpark is today , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when zooming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : handwritten numbered corridors from the so-called " original photo " from which the property tax was derived .	-6.5000
Today , small plots no longer cover farmers , but small gardeners of the land in the sun .	-5.3757
A large green area is visible north of Untersendling .	-3.3291
The Theresienwiese , the venue of the Oktoberfest since 1810 , was actually a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-4.0374
On the other side of the Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.8173
In the Urpositionsblatt , in the area of today 's Au-Haidhausen district , you can read not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the hill " Auf der Lüften " , but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-4.9430
Yes , people with delusions were once locked up here on Auerfeldstraße .	-4.0368
The Munich-Kreis-Irrenanstalt " Auf der Auer Lüften " was founded there in 1858 / 59 .	-3.1889
From 1872 onwards , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-5.2827
" He was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the anchoring of the so-called astray .	-5.3778
He has also banned the personnel from using force against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Haidhausen Museum , who has been working with the institution for an exhibition .	-5.3040
There was room for 280 patients at first , and then there were 500 .	-8.1896
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district irrenanstalt in Haar in 1905 .	-5.6059
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatry , has been located there since 2006 .	-4.5919
On the premises of the former Auer Anstalt youths now meet at the Salesianum in Munich .	-4.2629
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training enterprises .	-3.5511
To the west is the football pitch of the TSV München Ost , east residential houses from the 1980s .	-4.8121
In 2015 , the " Casa Don Bosco " children 's house was built , based on the original building of the Irrenanstalt , which had been destroyed by bombing during World War II .	-6.7017
Marienplatz was named " Haupt Platz " around 1856 , the Kaufingerstraße was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-3.6977
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich .	-3.0917
In December 1944 , the Allied bombs broke many holes into the city centre .	-6.7155
A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof .	-4.0387
The English Institute , small business buildings and a medieval crypt once stood at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work will take place these days , and the spade stitch for the second S-Bahn strain route will take place on 5 April 2017 .	-7.8179
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial photo of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof . , and . ! ! ! ! !	-6.9121
Citizens ' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-2.5068
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-3.8428
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on African-American travelers , visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention and exercise extreme caution when travelling through the state , because a number of dubious race-based incidents have recently been reported throughout the state , " stated in the Group 's opinion .	-7.2958
A recent Missouri law , which makes it harder for people to take action against discrimination , and the state ’ s law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities , prompted the group to issue travel warnings , said the NAACP .	-5.3602
" They have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-2.5957
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten up or killed , " said the president of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-6.5742
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . '	-2.7145
It is the first such warning issued by the US State Organisation .	-3.1311
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-6.9217
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline left while travelling through the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .	-5.5133
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri , which shows that black drivers are 75 % more likely than white drivers in the state .	-5.5017
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri , " Chapel said .	-2.8143
'People must be prepared whether they bring bailouts or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state . '	-8.0941
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime report , ranking the state as the country ’ s 16th country in terms of the number of such violations .	-4.8347
Travel warnings are also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.6107
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration , which ACLU believes will contribute to further race profiling .	-4.5777
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.6109
Weidezau Project is Elementary	-2.9320
The Fischerbacher Weidezau project is a successful project and will be continued next year .	-2.8695
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on the ground .	-4.3132
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Schwendemann family ’ s rectangular courtyard .	-5.6111
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm , where he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals , and houses holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.7660
For him , " Black Forest milk " is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , according to Schwendemann .	-3.4669
The guests ' table is exclusively regional .	-4.6249
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the pasture fence project " elementary important " .	-4.0520
I cannot make a profit on such steep land .	-6.3796
A lot of work needs to be done with the motor sense .	-4.6710
" We are struggling with the conditions and topography here , " said Schwendemann .	-3.8262
In 2003 he took over the parental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not run a bio-farm .	-5.4937
For mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : " The local authority recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the Leader promotion " .	-5.7532
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3 000 and 4 000 per hectare .	-3.1832
It is hoped that this will allow the reforestation of the land to continue for a while .	-5.0085
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their business , " said the mayor .	-5.6244
Farmers are often criticized for promoting it .	-3.2678
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced in through the support of willow fences .	-5.6181
The area covered is thus 40 hectares , which must not be reforested until at least 2023 .	-5.4664
Of the total costs of EUR 71 500 , half were subsidised by Leader , and a quarter were carried by the municipality of Fischerbach .	-5.3999
This leaves farmers EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fences .	-3.8503
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-2.4341
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You do a really good job , without farmers and rural women it is not possible " .	-4.1958
Peter Weiß also stated : " Best food is produced here " .	-3.4724
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables state funding of fences .	-2.8684
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.3873
A prerequisite is the presence of a funding framework designated by the LPR .	-5.3679
Moreover , the area to be fenced must not be tradable ( slope above 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-5.1081
For the Fischerbach Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , eight participants are currently applying for 24 plots to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence .	-5.1023
The area covered is 35 hectares , and the estimated cost is more than EUR 112 000 .	-8.1385
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.4697
Trump ’ s White House is now adopting the Statue of Liberty	-3.3908
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues .	-2.3362
Americans value them as much as anyone else – hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-4.0769
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe into the statue of liberty in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta about the president ’ s proposals to drastically limit legal immigration .	-4.1311
To be fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.6411
A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .	-3.1793
But he attacked its meaning , and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903 , 17 years after the monument was completed .	-5.2176
When Miller called Acosta , " I don 't want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-8.6556
The poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '	-2.3167
Miller is factually correct , but as he himself said , it is not really about history .	-2.9220
It is about contemporary resonance with the stirring words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only some old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your pains , your poor , your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely / the miserable waste of your rich coasts ' .	-6.5241
There was never a time when the ' miserable waste ' was better seen on our screens .	-3.1146
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.6515
This conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural debate : indeed , it is a conflict over America ’ s importance .	-4.2939
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act .	-8.3097
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical pictorial representation .	-4.8700
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-3.4690
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of exiles .	-2.5498
The poem ’ s connection with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.7965
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people on the right wanted to change it for a long time .	-3.8267
The great cry of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservatives who bring the American flame into the surrounding world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.5683
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-5.1752
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States . '	-2.6190
Quite unusual , Limbaugh found something here .	-4.7915
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the position of perception .	-3.2545
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships .	-4.3350
In the truest sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.2034
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .	-2.8437
And , of course , that is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize .	-2.9077
Their torch should not illuminate the way , but should ignite hatred , which is their only source of power .	-4.3225
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team	-2.9437
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team .	-1.9221
Neil Black , UK athletic performance director , says that the 16-man Scottish contingent in the World Cup will " make a massive contribution to the team . "	-5.3241
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-2.6566
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and that UK athletics must learn something from it .	-8.5320
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find it out , " said Black .	-2.7771
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.5624
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2992
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-1.9346
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.5410
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.3806
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected as team captain .	-4.9189
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.3286
Her captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.4215
" A number of athletes , whether Scottish or wherever they live or train , left the room and felt very proud and motivated .	-3.6551
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great . '	-4.0752
The Commonwealth Silver medal winner , who will compete at her fifth world championship at the 400m hurdles , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-4.5250
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes in the World Cup was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.3921
The medium haul driver , Muir , is on this path , setting five British and two European records last year .	-5.4078
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .	-2.7361
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot to watch after a great season of winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.2603
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in Team Lee McConnell was .	-3.4421
The team captain says that she is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team , but will also , in some cases , be involved in medals and finals .	-4.9869
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me makes it a very special thing for me , " she added .	-5.6483
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.2560
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.8738
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podiums .	-3.3018
As regards my speech as a captain ?	-2.4973
Yes , I think it went well .	-1.2732
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , because we have a home world championship .	-3.8985
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-4.1627
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . '	-3.6283
Block critics on Facebook : Don ’ t ask for public office if you can ’ t stand for voters ’ heating .	-6.3260
The father of our country knew a little about bad press .	-2.6134
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .	-2.8631
He shouted at the criticism , certainly .	-3.8779
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.1377
In 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and ' stupid and mute we are being slaughtered like sheep ' .	-4.5466
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.0778
Hogan ’ s staff blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-3.6116
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week .	-2.8545
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-2.1734
" It 's just Facebook , " many people said .	-1.6631
But it is important .	-0.7489
And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan .	-2.5846
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular .	-1.5722
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.8089
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-1.0123
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles .	-3.6818
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and play his hapless head for chemotherapy on his side .	-5.6026
Therefore , blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called official and paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-5.1318
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than moderation .	-2.4883
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers , or hate filled people who swing the whip online .	-3.9705
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-2.0352
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , not trolls .	-3.1162
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profound .	-1.8318
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-1.9902
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.3026
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the news programme " The Post " .	-3.5630
'I do not appreciate this idea either , when a number of people take a stand on the same subject , they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of citizens ' .	-6.1048
What the governor 's staff called a " concentrated spam attack , " others would probably call " intercession . " " .	-7.3855
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or removing a negative comment .	-3.4358
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same thing had been done by sending staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-4.3238
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-7.2601
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-2.2011
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.7224
One of the first milestones on this issue came last week in Virginia .	-1.9747
The Chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook page .	-3.4696
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.2874
This should not be so difficult .	-1.8981
At the time of Washington , the affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet .	-3.6447
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letterboxes invaded his leadership .	-3.6864
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.2693
The people who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " , and " Portius " wrote all the letters to newspapers that laid down Washington 's decisions .	-3.1485
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty , trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project 's online papers .	-4.2072
But he did not silence them .	-1.9396
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse are at the heart of our nation .	-2.5633
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.4661
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club .	-2.1266

" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-1.9975
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .	-2.5830
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .	-1.8831

Less lung cancer deaths caused by passive smoking	-1.6976
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-5.1640
Scientists from the University Hospital in Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) have reached this conclusion in a study .	-4.4156
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths per year are attributable to passive smoking , " said head of study Heiko Becher .	-3.8599
In comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .	-4.3221
Back then , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking in Germany .	-3.5524
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-2.0929
Housing connections turn out to be very complex .	-2.3328
Construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and " is reasonably in time " , says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .	-6.2025
In the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than anticipated , as there is much hidden underground which is not mentioned in the plans .	-7.3853
Traffic , which repeatedly hinders the construction work , is a major problem for the Stumpp construction staff .	-5.9396
" The ignorance of motorists in front of red traffic lights and barrier grids is already enormous , " reports Heinze .	-4.9098
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass .	-5.1560

When Bardina Degei cooks dinner , she does not use a stove .	-2.7459
It seldom uses a pot .	-2.5105
In her wooden house in Enarotali , the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called " nota " - directly into the fireplace .	-4.0792
After half an hour , the carved bone is removed and swallowed with diligent , unwashed hands .	-5.1946
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp .	-4.4219
A bucket in a rootless room serves as a latrine .	-2.7235
As the youngest of her husband ’ s four wives , she was not assigned any fields .	-3.8824
Polygamy is common here .	-1.4531
Of course , late work can be dangerous : most villagers are unemployed and many drink hard , and there are soldiers here .	-3.1428

It is a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders were to vote in public hands before the occupying forces .	-5.1377
An existing movement that stirred up independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government , which controls the region , excluding foreign journalists or legal observers .	-12.8072
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island .	-2.7152
Enarotali is as remote as it is deserted .	-3.0159
There is no public transport .	-1.7135
The city , with some 19,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated sheet roofs , converted by rust into various yellow brown tones .	-5.4439

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.3948
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold country .	-2.5920
The world ’ s largest and most profitable gold mine , Grasberg , owned by Phoenix ’ s McMoran Freeport , is only 60 miles from Paniai , a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.5408
In 2015 alone , Freeport lost $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-2.7181
Moreover , Papua has an estimated $ 78 billion worth of wood resources .	-3.0950
But these riches are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence .	-3.7365
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military and units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.4145
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gooses and are treated mercilessly .	-2.7057

Indonesian President Joko Widodo , popularly known as Jokowi , promised during his 2014 campaign to address inequalities and violations of rights in Papua .	-3.0472
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Paniai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.2307
But little has changed in Papua , and today locals feel cheated .	-2.6059
" Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi , with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-3.5048
Indeed , just two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October , Paniai suffered a low point .	-2.0127
On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through darkness on a motorcycle .	-2.7132
The frightened children told them that they should turn on their spotlights .	-2.9298
One of the soldiers took offence at their clay and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-4.5859
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .	-3.1966
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.3861
A child , the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was hit so hard that he fell into the coma .	-2.7910
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day .	-2.6631
About 1,000 young Papua men , women , and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .	-3.3946
They performed ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance of Papua ’ s Mee Pago-Stamm in a circle imitating a bird song .	-6.1099
Some demonstrators started throwing stones at police and military posts .	-3.1579
When the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " says an official TIME document that was not released to the local media .	-5.6106
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the leader of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for rest and asked the crowd to return home .	-3.4330
Nobody was in the mood to listen .	-1.5802
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .	-3.4687
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .	-3.0233
" It was crowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-2.0326
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times , so his cousin , who witnessed the shooting .	-3.4447
" I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that it was , " said Yohanes , who , like many Indonesians , bears only one name , the TIME in gloomy mood .	-4.4331
" I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . "	-2.5776
The chief inspector of the Papua police , Yotje Mende , told reporters that his officers only wanted to " secure " their station because they were attacked .	-3.6664
" We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " said the Papua police spokesman , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-2.5096
'It is about life and death . '	-1.7693
According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured .	-2.1555
The news about the killings only came ' filtered ' to Jakarta the following day .	-2.6815
Three weeks , Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura , expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical grievances in Papua .	-3.4268
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-2.8127
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he is setting up an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations .	-3.7788
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.0849
" Most injuries occurred a long time ago .	-1.4764
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000 ’ s .	-2.3540
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements , but there are processes that need to go through , " he said .	-3.3582
Then Wiranto retreated when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June , saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-7.8963
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-2.1696
Wiranto , accused by the UN of ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved , including the Paniai incident .	-4.0385
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with fierce disbelief .	-3.0061
" I have been interviewed four times over the past three years , but no progress has been made , " says Yohanes .	-2.9471
'I am tired . '	-1.1461
He says that years later he still lives in fear .	-1.9660
" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.3260
'I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . '	-2.8145
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.4160
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-2.2860
" After burying the corpses , the military searched for me , " he says .	-3.0620
The shootings have not stopped .	-1.4616
On Tuesday , Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai ’ s neighborhood of Deiyai .	-2.5434
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a conscientious man to hospital , one person died , and 17 others were injured , including children . .	-8.1981
The man , the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who drowned while fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to hospital .	-2.9447
Well-awaited villagers protested in front of the company ’ s location office .	-4.4872
The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings .	-3.0660
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) started shooting at the crowd and killed one .	-2.2666
" We were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered here quickly , according to the TIME .	-4.8053
'I hid my house for two days ' .	-2.9516
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for withdrawing the police mobile brigades from the area .	-3.1549
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian Government .	-2.1133
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.3279
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.0348
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.4623
In response , in recent years , thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and arbitrarily detained on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-3.2247
Some never appear again .	-2.0734
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.6283
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.2133
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.5073
Bread is equally out of reach .	-1.9951
The people here grow everything they eat : especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-4.1158
Agriculture is the job of women , who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .	-4.6213
They keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.4082
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.8095
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between indigenous Papua and the new migrants , who have risen in numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport .	-4.4182
The few jobs in the region usually go to the more educated and prosperous migrants .	-3.4592
Papua rarely have the capital or skills to run their own businesses in a competitive way .	-3.6285
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai .	-3.6436
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.3771
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain tight on international media .	-2.4490
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , even though they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.1251
According to Phelim Kine , Human Rights Watch ’ s deputy Asian director , Jokowi ’ s campaign ’ s promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-4.0493
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report about Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a blacklist , " he said in a statement .	-3.6031
Lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesia ’ s government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-2.5499
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands , and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai Shield .	-3.9269
The same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.6810
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Arrmanatha Nasir , dismissed the group 's accusations and said to journalists in Jakarta : ' Indonesia still has a democratic system and free media , so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.4922
The people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-2.0854
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human-rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and afflicted him with ' We want freedom ' , according to a source that also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous .	-4.7323
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again .	-2.2332
" Jokowi is a person with good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai committees , " says Gobai , Chairman of the tribal council .	-3.7231
He wants Jokowi to know that , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , the Paniai people are in poor education and health services .	-2.6853
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their vote for Jokowi as a " debt " that he must repay .	-3.4520
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-1.9970
Despite threats and intimidation , the families of the Paniai victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance : the body of a victim was buried on a site precisely opposite the police and the military station .	-4.5844
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not forget the perpetrators of their crimes .	-3.7223
" A member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with a lowered head .	-3.0425
'What else can we do ? '	-1.0310
Fires capture the Dubai skyscraper for the second time .	-3.4593
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high 79-floor building .	-4.8356
It is the second fire that sweeps through the tower in just two years , which is accidentally called the Torch Tower ( torch tower ) .	-5.4756
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.1095
" We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and the cries of the people .	-2.8225
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor , " said a resident who named his name as George , Reuters .	-4.4250
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units destroyed the fire and cooled the building around 4 : 00 a.m. local time ( GMT ) .	-6.3237
The government said that it is working to provide shelter for those affected .	-3.1282
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in areas outside high-rise buildings around the world .	-3.8931
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the covering , the outer lining for decoration or insulation .	-6.2602
In the United Kingdom , the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulating and covering the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed around 80 people .	-5.8608
No Davis Cup Reform : Continue Best-of-five	-8.9788
The president of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has gone through the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup coup .	-4.6438
At the Ho Chi Minh City meeting , the revolutionary proposal that Davis Cup players should only play on two winning rates was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-7.0318
The five-place classics , which are often very long , but are also very valued for this reason , are therefore retained in the traditional competition .	-8.8579
63.54 % of member countries voted for reform , so ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal was barely missed .	-3.2980
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members did not accept the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-3.6559
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions , " said Haggerty .	-2.6986
They will continue to work to improve their applications .	-3.9767
After many objections , the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place was not put to the vote .	-5.3939
New from 2018 onwards are only comparatively small details : For example , the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host rights in the next year in the first round .	-4.4966
In order to reduce costs for the organisers , the requirements in terms of training places , etc . , will be simplified and players will have to make less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-6.3284
More than 1 in 5 US travelers bring banned items onto the plane , finds out a survey .	-5.4123
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 % deliberately or unconsciously illicit items were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 % who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades .	-5.3568
Less than 1 % claimed that they were late in discovering that they had travelled erroneously with firearms , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.4941
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travelers tend to flout the rules .	-3.8678
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % , who were members of generation X .	-4.3475
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.9966
More than 3 % admitted that they had knowingly carried items with blades through the security check , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately put banned drugs on the aircraft .	-5.3619
The company said it had consulted travellers across the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many had deliberately done so .	-5.5295
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry smuggling goods - knowingly or unwittingly - through security were those who fly most frequently .	-4.8158
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.5189
People are often uncertain about what liquids they can take with them or how much of it .	-4.1055
No surprise , then , that most of the TSA ’ s confiscated items are prohibited liquids .	-4.0777
For a while , people thought the TSA could view books as smuggling goods .	-3.0362
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.7080
Elon Musk doesn ’ t matter : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel the order .	-2.5929
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to announce with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.8524
In doing so , he has so far denied that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-6.0290
In addition to the constantly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla CEO Elon Musk has , for the first time , revealed a different , less brilliant figure when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-7.7735
Over the past few months , Musk has often advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , the delivery of which is just beginning .	-5.3541
Now Musk admits : Of the 518,000 pre-orders , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-3.8436
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-3.0946
In the event of a cancellation , Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro ( 1000 US dollars in the USA and 1000 pounds in the UK ) " Reservation Deposit " .	-6.7660
At present , 455,000 such non-binding reservations were planned , Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .	-5.2335
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem .	-5.1673
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not with demand , but with production .	-3.5708
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.2024
In 2018 - all models taken together - it will be 500,000 , and in 2020 a million .	-4.1134
The demand for this is obvious .	-2.2367
According to Musk , 1800 reservations are currently added per day .	-3.8717
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla is able to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without any major interruptions with maximum utilisation .	-6.1195
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.4927
However , if there are major delays , the non-binding nature of the reservations could become the problem for Tesla .	-4.7438
Because then the company cannot prevent discontented customers from getting away in droves .	-4.6872
EPA Chairman Pruitt is withdrawing from the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions .	-4.7716
A day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the Environmental Protection Agency ’ s chief , reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce Smog emissions of air pollutants .	-4.8383
Pruitt presented the change when his agency was more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-4.6771
He did not mention the complaint brought against his previous post in a federal court of appeal .	-3.8317
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-3.2721
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time , study the plan , and avoid ' interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth ' .	-3.5265
Pruitt , who was Oklahoma ’ s Public Prosecutor prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump , was for a long time a staunch opponent of tougher environmental regulations . , , the of , the . , the of . , the of	-9.3157
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry oppose .	-3.5197
Wednesday ’ s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt ’ s regulatory rollback agenda .	-1.7468
Last month , a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-4.2352
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his U-turn on ozone standards simply strengthens the EPO ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-4.7497
" Under previous administrations , the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by groups of activists and others and , in an agreement , set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.2078
" We do not believe in legal regulation , and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.9266
We also take the law and the authority that we have seriously . '	-2.5428
Nevertheless , the EPO 's opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use its ' late power and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are ' based on sound policy and the best available information ' .	-5.0616
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader overhaul of ozone rules .	-2.5681
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.4141
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.4434
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that sued EPAs this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.9941
" The EPA 's reversal - according to our complaints - is an important health and safety benefit for these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.1518
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-1.4758
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .	-2.6717
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-2.9540
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered about Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-2.9831
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-8.8207

Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church .	-1.4960
750 Years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , a Serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday 16 July at 4.30 p.m.	-4.5290
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .	-3.7551
Visitors to the sixth Benefit Gallery can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-3.7425
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made Tumlingen 's friends and patrons their concern .	-6.2009
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village jewel " .	-2.9964
In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg Book of Documents : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen along with the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber .	-4.2227
According to the letter of the document , on the Tumlinger Berg , apart from the former parish church , there was also a stately court , to which the church or the patronage right belonged and not the other way round .	-6.7240
People also lived there .	-2.6899
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt in 1858 , next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen , the " mountain " was the third , the dominant settlement centre of the village .	-6.3177
Old maps dating back to 1600 underpin these historical realities .	-5.3089
The patronage law originated from the early Middle Ages .	-5.4084
A gentleman who built , equipped and occupied a church with a parish remained the owner of this church and could also inherit it it .	-5.7423
This was accompanied by the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .	-3.6111
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-1.8897
The larger of the two collapsed at Christmas 1673 .	-3.5097
The newly purchased bell first sounded in 1692 , but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942 .	-4.9205
In the Thirty Years War ( 1616 to 1648 ) the windows were sunk and the bell ropes were stolen .	-4.2072
The roof was leaking .	-1.7743
In 1796 French troops were stored near the church .	-3.0902
They broke the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-2.7466
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-3.1806
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler .	-3.7185
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilarius was demolished .	-3.1875
Only the church tower was left standing .	-2.5706
In New Year 's Eve in 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .	-3.7698
In order to prevent an accident , the tower was demolished .	-4.1373
Only the tower dwarf , which still exists today , remained as a witness to the 750 year old church history .	-4.3332
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cultivate the Hilarius plant as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn .	-3.0554
As organiser , the friends and patrons of Tumlingen invite to the sixth Serenade at the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel on Sunday 16 July .	-5.0386
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-3.6027
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word .	-3.7827
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.5943
Incoming is from 3.30 p.m.	-3.2605
At the end of the Serenade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .	-4.4916
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest " , the organizers highlight the fantastic view .	-4.3689
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-2.1516
The organizers are hoping for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius facility , which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler .	-4.3949
Friends and patrons of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care , as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms .	-3.9977
Association wants to have permission of wind turbines tested	-4.8181
" Boisheim defends itself " does not see any legal precondition for the construction and has therefore approached the councillor .	-5.7551
The association " Boisheim wehrt sich " has asked councillor Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines at the Nette Boisheimer .	-5.0031
It was unlawful .	-1.9889
The association argues that , at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at Boisheimer Nette , because at the time only the city border with Schwalmtal had existed a wind power concentration zone in Viersen .	-6.7143
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city .	-5.4072
Such zones are designed to prevent the landscape from being " saved " .	-5.1476
A few days earlier , the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Nette Boisheimer - which had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district government because of a formal error .	-6.9543
" Due to the lack of a planning legal basis , the approval decision issued is still unlawful and therefore also withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim is resisting " .	-6.8516
Current state of affairs : before the summer recess , the City Council again decided on the wind concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette ; the district government has yet to approve it .	-6.9379
Erkens : ' This means that the granting of permission for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law ' .	-7.2199
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.9160
" The relevant letters have been received by Viersen County since last week , " said a speaker .	-4.1961
The circle takes them to look again at the matter .	-4.2205
However , they are unlikely to result in the process being stopped .	-4.0225
In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court , the district did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association " Boisheim wehrt sich " on Thursday .	-5.4380
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four 200-metre windmills on an area of the Nette Boisheimer .	-4.0613
Last year , the company , in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved , had already concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .	-4.9749
The construction of the four wind turbines will be able to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .	-5.7996
The NEW Re wants to invest about EUR 20 million .	-2.6239
Last summer , Viersens City Council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County .	-4.2928
Crack Car and Tractor : Women dies in a terrible accident	-7.8068
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at about 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel ( Rhein-Lahn-Kreis ) .	-3.5221
A woman was killed .	-1.9271
Two other people were slightly injured .	-1.8458
The highway remained closed for hours .	-2.8300
After police information , a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich , accompanied by her car , and her 53-year-old mother , found the L 333 in the direction of Bogel .	-6.2227
City and Dealers Planning " Homeland Ships " Weekend	-4.3473
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-3.9637
The trade association and the city administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping .	-6.1119
As the chairman of the trade association Christian König announced , the " Homeland Shipping " weekend is intended to make customers aware of the offers offered by their own city away from the usual supermarket goods .	-7.0287
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned , similar to the weekly market .	-3.8387
In addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprenticeships .	-3.4338
In addition , the shops of the city centre are to be invited to " midnight shopping " .	-5.8088
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the surrounding region .	-5.0289
In preparation are commercials on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the weekend of action , according to Christian König .	-4.3041
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-3.3851
This means that the trade association and the city will enter another stage of the project " Attractive city centre " .	-5.3191
These include new offers such as the first " Active Day " at the Well Festival and the sale of Sunday , discussions with all traders and hosts to get them to participate actively .	-6.6022
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .	-4.2020
In addition , customer potential is to be reopened or re-opened .	-4.5531
These include spa guests and tourists .	-2.4605
However , many locals would also have lost sight of the city center when shopping .	-8.4493
In the end , everyone would have to help revive the city centre , including landlords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .	-5.4671
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network , which had partly spread , King said in the spring .	-4.7277
Birgit Streich , head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , announced that five Thuringian cities will participate in the third " Heimat-Shoppen " day , nationwide .	-4.8880
Besides Bad Langensalza these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-2.3311
The day should " promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities , " he says .	-5.7687
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her direct environment through his / her purchasing behaviour .	-6.5943
Two deaths and several injuries following the explosion at US School	-3.9395
During construction work , a gas explosion occurred in the school building .	-3.5374
New people were injured .	-1.5487
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine others injured , some of them severely .	-6.3098
According to the fire brigade , on Wednesday ( local time ) another injured person was in critical condition .	-4.1643
A person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion .	-2.6181
A missing person was also recovered dead later .	-4.2945
The dead were school employees .	-1.5704
As a matter of accident , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .	-4.2987
At the time of the holiday , few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building .	-3.6290
Trump pressured Mexico for paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of telephone calls .	-4.1962
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-2.1055
On January 27 , Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.6364
The US President insulted him for publicly denouncing the wall and reportedly said to him : ' You cannot tell the press that ' .	-4.3498
Trump started his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the US southern border , and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.4347
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.2565
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US is " ridiculous , " bad , " and " stupid , " and that insistence on trade provided by the Obama administration would make him look like a " depp " after proposing a ban on resettlement of refugees to the US .	-5.4764
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull , ' this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-4.1773
Moore Ford Massacre : Activists resubmit racist Lynchakt as a call for justice .	-3.9749
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rushed to the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-4.3397
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .	-3.3437
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windscreen .	-4.4416
Inside , the inmates were frightened .	-3.6359
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " the man shouted .	-2.1303
'Get it out of the car ! '	-1.4911
Schreie torn the silence when a young black man was dragged from the front-passenger seat .	-3.1776
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a replay .	-4.3194
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience found very real sighs .	-4.6237
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to emulate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.5330
No one has ever been charged with the murders .	-2.2164
" It is truly incomprehensible that in all these years , not a single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organise the repatriation .	-4.9535
'It is a dirt stain on a story , but it is a burden on our souls ' .	-4.3856
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a civil rights activist for a lifetime .	-3.5645
For him , deference serves as a dramatic call to action , and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.0904
" We want prosecution , we want ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-2.7021
'We cannot heal and reconcile until we get justice ' .	-2.9824
A forensic doctor lays a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Order synthesis on 27 July 1946 .	-5.4099
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process .	-8.2805
But no one has ever been charged .	-1.8674
Although suspects have remained at large for decades , civil-rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch ’ s actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-4.2038
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court ruling allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer .	-3.5538
About the same time as the election , according to the FBI , Roger Malcom , the black farmer , stumbled a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight - allegedly for a woman .	-5.8795
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom ’ s wife Dorothy , and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .	-3.9313
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to release Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-2.2927
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.0229
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynchmob surrounded the car .	-3.0638
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes an FBI report .	-2.4028
'It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses ' .	-4.2851
Brooks put it even more succinctly .	-2.0300
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-2.0487
'They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and if you vote , you will be here . '	-4.2654
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene led the annual follow-up of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch ’ s murders .	-3.5955
Their presentation is vivid , moving , and rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America .	-4.1861
It is hard to watch , and even harder to look away , but Greene said that is the point .	-3.9748
" We don 't want to talk about lynching because we are then confronted with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-3.8984
" But I cannot establish a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have been through " .	-4.0501
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - poured into a room and listened when Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece .	-5.7065
Wade Marbaugh is Greene 's co-director .	-2.4377
He has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role would never be easier .	-3.2344
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-2.4241
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times ' .	-2.8995
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.1599
The play begins with Malcom , who attacks and afflicts Hester , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-3.8294
'I said n --- he , disappeared from my property ! '	-2.3269
Rascona returns fire .	-1.8421
There is a break .	-0.9829
And then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) breaks out into laughter .	-2.8499
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.0703
" What ? ! " asked Rascona .	-6.1737
It is alarmed and confused .	-1.0263
Was I too tough ?	-1.3724
" No , " Greene said , still kicking .	-3.4681
'I simply do not think that white people said ' n --- he ' . '	-3.2854
" But " , one of the other black actors joked .	-3.1178
'You only have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-2.4755
And that is exactly where the energy in the room is shifting , a feeling of comradeship replaces discomfort .	-4.9631
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-2.8730
The scene starts again .	-1.3221
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and emphatically .	-2.8120
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.9419
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-2.2633
There are shootings , shootings and then silence .	-2.5992
A woman dressed with a sorrow stands above the bodies of the actor and performs Billie Holidays 's mourning speech " Strange Fruit " .	-5.1279
Your voice breaks with every second word .	-2.7497
About a hundred metres behind it , a group of around four dozen spectators is sweat and tears out of sight .	-5.3037
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .	-2.7319
A couple arrived from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many are just down the street .	-4.6564
They have experienced Georgian humidity for almost eight hours , when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys .	-4.4999
Up to this point , the killings have remained anecdotal , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lynch killings took place , the air is ghostly .	-4.9809
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name .	-2.9553
Children raise their heads , register the falsified blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other .	-4.0218
" They are not really dead , " a little boy murmurs as if he wanted to remember .	-3.7924
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-2.5579
The actors throw away the lynch and wipe out their tears .	-2.8531
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man in suit who played the clan member .	-2.0380
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down crying in their arms , and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .	-4.1401
" It is okay , " whispers one of the women .	-1.8636
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-2.0798
You did so for one reason . '	-1.6072
Later , the audience met the actors for dinner .	-3.2111
At a table , a white couple from Atlanta excited about the replay with a black pair they have just met .	-7.2254
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling .	-2.5812
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do this because they look like you , " she said .	-7.4695
" What this really does with me leads me to believe that lynching is still going on , " she added , " today it is only called a police shooter . "	-5.8527
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks ’ court holds at his table , eats and reminds of civil rights .	-3.8902
He said he had already started planning the performance next year .	-3.1488
" Defense is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-4.0273
" If we do not learn anything from it , it can happen again .	-4.4009
Those who do not study their own history , those who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat it . '	-2.6600
The Wagnerians in Bayreuth reconciled the Dawn of the Gods .	-3.4551
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf relies on a colourful frivolous staging against a gigantic six-storey backdrop .	-4.1495
The revolving stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) shows a shabby street corner with the wall and dönerbude in Berlin , a " Plaste und Elaste " logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-5.1316
Before that , there is an open Mercedes classic car park , where the Rhine daughters pose as rock-energy vehicles , or alternatively an Isetta .	-6.8017
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf 's leitmotif - money , power and greed - which runs through his " ring " stag.	-5.3139
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize beautifully as in the " Rheingold " .	-2.9808
Kess seduces Siegfried ( Stefan Vinke ) , drags a corpse into the boot in Hollywood style and gives the Krawallo clique .	-3.7870
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer .	-3.8936
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried .	-3.7135
Later , Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) still has to believe .	-4.0864
The audience would like to thank the ensemble with strong applause .	-3.4451
Foster , Milling , Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in a stormy manner , which humbly bows hands to the Merkel-Raute .	-8.0833
There is great applause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing .	-6.8386
The show was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his director .	-4.1493
Five years later , when he had to go on a whistle concert in 2013 , there was great jubilation in which the occasional " buh " cries fell .	-8.2233
The director of the festival Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this .	-5.4437
" One realizes that the audience has somehow grown together with the " ring " , she said just before the performance of the dpa .	-4.7462
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but also an understanding of his view grew .	-6.7927
I would like to draw a positive conclusion .	-3.2385

I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works .	-3.2276
Unlike in civil engineering studies ?	-3.0722
Quantity : Well , this is not about calculating statics .	-4.4184
You always have other people in front of you , each with a different story behind you .	-5.0434

Very interesting .	-0.5605
And you had no fear of touch ?	-2.2991
Lots : I am not the type for that .	-3.3419
It is an area that gives you a lot .	-2.7223
A lot of love , a lot of kindness .	-2.5893
There are also negative moments , but life is like that .	-4.1925
Pearson is cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting the dividend to revive business .	-2.7671
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 % , as another restructuring program would be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .	-5.6304
The job cuts that Director-General John Fallon announced mostly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 come in addition to his previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 jobs .	-4.4085
Pearson announced in May , in a third cost-cutting program , a cost reduction plan of £ 300 million ( $ 394 million ) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid move to digital learning .	-4.9882
The company , which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after it had increased from 1 % to £ 2.05 billion in the first half of the year .	-4.9002

A statement by NATO states that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening , when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was ' attacked ' by a ' people-supported improvised explosive device ' .	-5.5451
It says that all the injured are in a stable condition and are treated in the US military hospital at Bagram airport .	-4.6924
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State ( ISIS ) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in the nearby Bagram .	-2.7284
According to the United Nations , at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .	-3.0325

EPA Reverses Decision on Delaying the Smog Rule after Complaints	-3.0595
The US Environmental Protection Agency has revoked a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration that requires states to contain smog-causing emissions , a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move .	-5.7078
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to promote the so-called ' ozone provisions 2015 ' and said that it is showing the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with States .	-5.2684
" We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners , " said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.5031
In June , Pruitt announced the EPO ’ s intention to delay the ozone provisions – which aim to measure pollutant emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards – by one year until October 2018 .	-5.1107
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-2.8599
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has sought to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump claims will boost economic growth .	-3.8523
However , the efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups , who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-5.2420
The EPA website says that inhaling air that contains ozone can " reduce the lung function and increase the respiratory symptoms " such as asthma . is . . is in the . . is . . is .	-14.8982
Community area	-2.5748
In the end , the decision was clear : with two votes against , the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a Community area in the future residential complex .	-5.1327
Before the discussion there is an important piece of information : the purchase contract for the missing piece of land has been signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden . . .	-10.5698
Although it will take some time before the area previously owned by the parish church is in the parish 's possession , there is now no obstacle to planning the project to be put up by a private investor .	-7.1477
There is a debate on a Community area for this .	-6.1123
One of the two investors still on board offered to meet the community .	-3.2606
On the ground floor he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .	-4.7303
The administration and the majority of the municipal council would like to see such a common area not just as a meeting place for seniors , but open to the community .	-6.9405
As an example , the word " knitting café " went round .	-3.5381
The decision that was pre-empted by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn is being overlooked by means of support opportunities .	-7.0489
The building is located in the rehabilitation area .	-3.0465
The creation of a Community area , Tjaden reports , would be eligible for 60 % of 30 % .	-3.3070
The proposal for a resolution , in order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a stick between their legs in this respect , provides for the observation that both the saddle - which is in line with the surrounding construction - and the pulse roof - which reduces the pitch and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .	-8.8187
It is not only Wilfried Sohmer who believes that this addition is unnecessary . , , .	-7.8561
If it helps , it happens unanimously .	-3.6578
The Community area is not so easy .	-2.9458
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings , which do not make much progress , but the Community area is now being rejected , she says : ' I ' .	-8.6598
Yvonne Staiger is very much in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against local participation .	-4.9480
It sees it as a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .	-4.2526
That is not the case , because the purchase of land does not grant a subsidy , but rather gets a real value that can be marketed in the event of doubt , is the counter-argument .	-7.8967
Mr Staiger 's proposal to split the proposal for a decision accordingly has three supporters .	-4.3221
That is how two votes against the original programme , which Stefan Haller summarizes : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-5.2063
Car collision : Wheelers are thrown on the road .	-4.7273
On Wednesday in Garath , a 82-year-old cyclist was captured and seriously injured by a car while crossing the road .	-7.7956
As the police announced , the 82-year-old Langenfelder had travelled by bicycle on the Schwarzer Weg road from Hilden at 12.20 p.m.	-6.1480
The senior wanted to cross the railway at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch .	-3.4668
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority .	-2.5279
When the Langenfeld took to the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic .	-10.1796
He came together with a car that managed a 66-year-old helper .	-4.3768
The man was thrown onto the street .	-2.4196
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue message .	-3.9339
FC Bayern Munich has to forgo David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund .	-3.8180

With staff care the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .	-4.5290
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the trophy winner .	-4.4025
The human resources at the German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday ( 20.30 h / ZDF and Eurosport ) at the trophy winner Borussia Dortmund .	-6.9294
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti has to forgo David Alaba in the duel with the BVB .	-4.6346
The Italian confirmed this on Friday .	-1.9136
In addition , the Münchners Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing .	-2.9902
Ancelotti was responsible for the five defeats in the last six test games for the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team .	-4.3289
" We know that we are not in the best physical condition , " said Ancelotti , adding : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-2.7353
That was not good last time . '	-2.5682
The 58-year-old believes , however , in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory season .	-8.9170
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-0.9047
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities .	-2.5129
The team is ready .	-0.6231
We want to play intelligently , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intensive game " .	-2.3836
The duel of the two German soccer weights captivates the fans .	-4.0190
The game is sold out with 81.360 spectators , the German Football League ( DFL ) announced on Friday .	-3.5018
Moving from Star to Star in the Harz	-3.5740
In the resin the first " star path " is to be created nationwide .	-4.4451
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans this .	-2.9106
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.5906
A " Star Path " met the need for information from many resin visitors , it was said .	-5.4244
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.4820
Members want to set up boards along the planned route and then inform about stars and constellations .	-5.2203
In a first phase up to 2018 the association plans " easily accessible installations in five to six places " in Oberharz .	-4.5528
It would be called St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeiß and Sieber .	-4.3950
The information on the panels should be supplemented via the Internet .	-3.3989
Therefore , a good mobile network reception is important when choosing the location .	-5.0340
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.7839
Later , the star path of Zug by Zug will be extended .	-4.8128
" On the Star Path the spectators learn a lot worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-5.7984
They also learned why stars have different colors , or why a star shines more than another , even though it is much further away .	-4.9389
It will also explain the constellation in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see .	-6.0151
The association has been operating the highest observatory in North Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-3.9912
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the National Park Harz is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-4.0062
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen with the naked eye .	-3.3113
Since 2003 , on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen , there has been something similar in the United States city to the planned Star Shift - the Planetary Path .	-5.9045
Beginning in front of Gebhardt 's hotel in Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary trail leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an " alien " site in Diemarden with the planet Sedna .	-5.8120
The steels with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to dwarf planets at the endpoint - are located exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion .	-6.0517
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimetres in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 centimetres .	-4.9569
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres .	-3.2113
While light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to stand with Pluto .	-4.1175
Pedestrians are thus faster than light in space .	-2.3204
The march to the next fixed star , however , would take half a year .	-3.4944
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discussing a possible showdown .	-1.6375
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who were on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .	-3.5210
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia , the unrivalled World Boxing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-Federgewicht-Champion .	-4.0369
After Garcia 's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for Pound-Liste .	-4.1107
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-3.0042
I wish you good luck . '	-1.3710
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7 p.m. on Saturday evening .	-1.9121
When the couple posed for photos , Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between combatants would be the " perfect order of magnitude . "	-7.8686
" I am a former feather weight , " recalled Garcia .	-2.6903
" I went up for bronze [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.8627
I am small for 140 .	-0.9275
I would like to come down to lightweight .	-3.1336
And he has to move on lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.4657
That is what the fans are asking for .	-5.7660
Let us give them that ' .	-1.6303
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.6316
'Boxes need this fight ' .	-1.5170
Klimas asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View , part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) , who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .	-5.4271
" This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it , " said Garcia , and later expressed openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package .	-5.4164
We are the best .	-0.6957
No other names can generate this kind of attention .	-2.0331
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.4122
Garcia said he regards Lomachenko as " a huge fighter , " and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight .	-4.8030
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the three-fight champion from Riverside look " very slow , I am sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out " .	-5.5124
Garcia said the focus is to show strong , then boxes .	-2.7892
Both said that they could feel the momentum they had built up for their own struggle .	-6.7690
" This is the battle that must be carried out .	-2.5498
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.7326
I am more than happy to work on this , " said Garcia .	-1.8226
Lomachenko said : ' I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.3996
It will be a great fight . '	-1.9653
Four injured after Reifenplatzer	-2.8946
In an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .	-2.7614
According to initial information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the Marktbreit junction , presumably after a tyre plater .	-6.1086
The car slid to the right into the slope , where it was overloaded and then lying on the roof in the green strip .	-7.4051
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .	-2.4341
The A7 was closed for about an hour to the north during the emergency service ’ s first delivery of the injured , and then the traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident site .	-8.0560
Fortuna Hoffmann : ' Triple works better '	-2.9590
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 season opening against Braunschweig that the optimisation of the defensive formation in Aue points .	-5.0179
Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the first season game , and the result would not have been the two opposing pitches against Braunschweig .	-6.9615
" These were two counterparts too much , and we have to be even more vigilant in Aue , " says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.5445
In the Ore Mountains the triangle is to be further optimized .	-4.4394
And the fortunes no longer want to capture a goal after a free strike .	-5.3580
'For the future , it will be the case that no one will stand alongside Michael ( Rensing ) . '	-5.6926
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better after the experience in preparing the triple-chain than with the quadruple chain .	-7.2196
" I do not yet know how we will act in Aue , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we just have players in the triangle on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-5.1688
'It is a prerequisite , but that we harmonise even better and that we do not afford to make so many playback errors ' .	-5.7940
Of course Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game .	-2.8532
" Whether one can speak of a failed start after a draw does not know .	-4.4147
The performance could well be okay , " Hoffmann said .	-3.3292
'But if we can stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good start to the season . '	-5.5730
His trainer didn 't want to know about this .	-3.3020
" I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the Sachsen match in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm .	-5.4304
" Now they can start the season almost with a home game , " says Funkel and Hoffmann , who believes that Aue players might even be a little fresher , because they don 't have a big and complete game like Fortuna against an upward favorite in the bones .	-7.9256
" But they don 't know 100 % where they are at the moment , " says Fortuna 's interior defender .	-8.6812
It is true that the guests from the Rhineland as a light favourite will meet on Sunday in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue .	-6.0623
" The fact that we sweep them away just because we claim to be among the first six is nonsense , " says Funkel , whose record is positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games .	-6.0758
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to be beaten from the start , " says Fortuna 's chief coach .	-3.9758
'To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant ' .	-2.3674
And so Funkel doesn 't want to experience his players on Sunday .	-4.3950
New results of Sweden 's Asylum Assessment Tests	-3.9801
Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of people tested are over 18 years old , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.7951
The Swedish Ministry of Forensic Medicine ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) started the testing last year .	-4.6188
They are intended to make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration agency ( migration union ) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage .	-6.6651
To date , Migration Chart has sent 6,880 cases to be tested , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-4.1900
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) were rated as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-4.3077
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years of age " .	-2.5726
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-3.1096
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-2.4586
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.3450
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to have been over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age .	-4.1008
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases ' suggesting that the person investigated was 18 years or older ' .	-3.4148
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases , the person had frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-8.6318
The method of medical age assessment , in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI shots of knee joint are taken , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-5.7204
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual .	-3.8799
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.6539
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.9912
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend we could , " he said to the newspaper Metro .	-3.2846
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is low .	-3.5132
The greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case about 10 % . '	-4.2243
Full of the Plan	-1.2896
Work on the three bridges of Landstrasse 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.8150
On Wednesday , a seven-tonne concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-6.6962
" We are very good at the time , it is running super , " says Reinhold Leicht , construction manager at the Department of Road Transport in Freiburg .	-9.6866
In April the work started simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation .	-4.3655
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be adhered to .	-4.4799
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads over the Trombach .	-2.8811
It is a concrete vaulted arch bridge covered with red colored stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-5.1600
It was built in 1900 .	-1.1332
Like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .	-4.1528
In order to ensure durability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .	-5.0619
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach .	-1.8171
They are made of red colored sandstone .	-3.0163
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.60 meters long .	-3.3932
The bridge at the entrance to the village of Lauterbach received a 1.30 m wide bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning and seven tons of heavy .	-7.3589
This is a border attachment which is also used as a way of operating .	-7.6164
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-4.2071
Then the pedestrian path should run .	-4.5977
The special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of Schramberg company Dizwo .	-4.7246
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-2.4567
Particular attention has been paid to the installation of pipelines by the Lauterbach building .	-5.4124
This is also where a fibreglass cable runs , to which many companies are connected .	-5.0349
The residents were informed about the project by hand in advance of the work .	-4.6082
In addition , fish and crabs first had to be fished .	-2.8886
For bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is single-lane controlled by a traffic light .	-4.7045
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance the road in the area of the bridge is completely closed at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " .	-4.8569
The total cost of the three reconstruction projects is EUR 700 000 .	-4.0170
It is financed by the country .	-2.8938
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protest at German potato salad	-2.1471
It does not happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative für Deutschland ( AfD ) , it comes together , which otherwise is difficult to reconcile .	-3.9066
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district congress ( CDU , SPD , Grüne , FDP , FWG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that peacefully shows flag on that day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the poster " Great campaign start " .	-6.4516
And well-known names will be launched , such as Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , will be the leading duo for the federal election on September 24 , and Beatrix von Storch , Deputy Chairman of the German Parliament .	-7.4044
But those who are already there hours before the event starts want to demonstrate rather than listen to the AfD people .	-4.9902
The motto " The Eifel remains colourful " .	-2.3468
Originally the town picnic was planned on the Brunnenplatz under the motto " All at one table " , but now takes place in the parking area below the toboggan run - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle .	-6.7307
A colorful picture that comes up there .	-4.7207
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of the One World Forum and one of the authoritative organizers , is really pleased : " Great how many people have met here " .	-5.7594
There is music and a lot of food , including a " German potato salad that the AfD could eat without any problems " , says the woman who brought him with him .	-5.5255
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , and they are mainly present at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .	-5.8483
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-2.2892
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcanic Eifel reported that he was trying to get such an event and was awarded the prize .	-6.7257
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun , but was refused there because of the already built Laurentius church there were not enough parking spaces .	-6.1928
So now the rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-4.0740
With regard to the event on the Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.5018
This is what it does : At around 8 p.m. , a band provides entertainment on Rondellvorplatz , and various speakers in the Stadthalle , including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD Chairman Uwe Junge .	-6.4201
There are about 200 people in the Chamber who are waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches .	-5.2668
The police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-2.9048
The AfD event lasts for a little more than an hour , the guests on the square have a longer breath , but there is also a need to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.	-7.6456
The police can leave - no special events .	-3.7548
The Trompete	-2.3999
A repertoire with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli is available in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .	-5.2680
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert entitled " Black Sea meets Black Forest " , or even " Balkan folklore " meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .	-3.4598
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and perform solo performances in top European orchestras .	-3.3654
Petkov is Solotrompeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the soloist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .	-3.5425
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .	-4.0885
Johann Sebastian Bach , like in a new guitar , sounds like " World Music " with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece " Exchange Suite " by jazz musician Nils Wogram , classical music , jazz and free play combine to form a fascinating total artwork .	-9.2286
This core piece of the programme was premiered this spring with enormous success in Freiburg .	-4.7163
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert .	-4.5363
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality	-1.3800
" Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .	-2.0642
But I want to try everything , " says Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality .	-2.8057
'Once I bite in grilled cheese , I think : ' Oh that was cool , what comes next ? ' .	-4.0292
The Hollywood star 's most famous relationship was that with her twilight fellow Robert Pattinson , who eventually went sorely apart .	-6.3004
In spite of all this , the brittle performer assures the " Harper 's Bazaar " magazine : " I was in love with everyone I 've been in .	-6.4685
Or do you think I had played it ? '	-2.5705
After their separation Kristen admitted that she was bisexual : " I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it .	-3.6182
So I have never been confused or obstructed .	-2.2030
I have never liked to be taken seriously . '	-2.6654
She was particularly affected by this , according to " Bang Showbiz " , but in school , when she preferred to dress like a boy : " Not all girls are typical girls .	-6.7161
That really hurt me a great deal .	-3.3795
When I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a bust .	-3.3513
I felt really attacked , frightened and ashamed .	-2.4354

In particular , they do not like to explain their love life to the public : " People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me .	-4.1894

West Virginia Governor announced that he would change the party .	-3.2080
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening in a rally with President Trump that he would change the party .	-3.0162
Whether you like it or not , the Democrats have moved away from me , " said Governor Justice .	-2.3441
'Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today , as a resident of West Virginia , I will tell you that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . '	-4.5724
The rally broke into jubilee .	-2.1349
" Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans , " added Justice .	-1.9988
'As a trainer , I would say it is time to play another game . '	-2.7344
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .	-2.7062

It is worth about $ 1.59 billion .	-1.0802
In the meantime , the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening saying : ' Governor Justice 's change of party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again ' .	-4.9033
" With only 15 governements and the control of least legislative bodies in history , Governor Justice ’ s announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive , unifying message , " said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News .	-5.2690
Coe praises " honest " Russian apology for doping scandal	-2.4000
On Thursday , the global leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated in sport .	-4.7653
Russia ’ s athletic leader , Dmitry Shylakhtin , said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World athletics championships that his country ’ s withdrawal from sport was correct , and that he was determined to fight doping .	-4.7804
He said he was sorry for " all the athletes who were snatched away gold and silver medals in competitions " .	-5.0322
Despite its comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-2.7048
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-1.9071
'The entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised with itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is redesigned ' .	-5.6591
Coe said he was also ' pleased ' that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction .	-3.1281
" I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the Task Force 's recommendations that this is not the time to restore Russia , " said Coe .	-3.4346
" In the coming months , we must do everything possible to normalise this situation .	-3.4598
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system , " he added . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.5979

Sadly for Missing Soldiers in Mali	-2.2444
At a funeral in Fritzlar in northern Hesse , some 1000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .	-4.4224
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Cathedral City under high security precautions .	-3.5667
On the unresolved crash , Secretary of Defense Ursula of the Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing .	-3.9891
However , she called the two defeated pilots " experts of their field " .	-5.5849
" We bow down to this highest sacrifice they made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she said .	-3.7480
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from Northern Hesse died in Mali , West Africa , on Wednesday a week ago .	-3.8511
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday accompanied by a death guard of the Bundeswehr .	-5.8270
At lunchtime , only the family members of the church left .	-6.1142
After that , the funeral in the family , the closest friends , representatives of the German Armed Forces and politicians began .	-5.3286
These included Hesse ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker .	-3.4401
Sad guests laid down roses , the family members stood arms in arms at the coffins .	-5.3383
In front of the church Fritzlar and many soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .	-2.7895
The Defense Minister of the Ley called the defeated soldiers " highly decorated " and operational experience .	-5.4530
The Tiger fighter pilot was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots in his region .	-5.7062
Volker Bauersachs , commander of the regime to which the soldiers belong , also said : ' If this occupation could not prevent the crash , no one would have succeeded ' .	-5.7580
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen : the deployment was dangerous .	-3.8649
But it is also of great importance ' for a country from which we are separated by only two states ' , she said .	-3.3574
After the funeral , the coffins were brought out of the cathedral .	-2.8438
When and where they are buried , the German Armed Forces did not provide any information .	-4.2646
Prince Henrik wants no grave beside his wife .	-2.4258
The man of the Danish queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-2.4385
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday .	-2.5235
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-3.9762
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard made a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.5132
The Queen agreed with her husband ’ s decision , as stated in the communication .	-4.3537
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear .	-2.1708
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .	-3.3553
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of his unhappy title .	-2.5837
After his wife Margrethe ’ s ascent to the throne in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .	-3.7459
In 2016 , he retired with the title of " Prince Election " .	-5.0047
Since Henrik was not given the title and function he wanted in Denmark , he does not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death , explained Lene Balleby , the head of the Danish royal house .	-6.0823
Where the last retirement of the 83-year-old will ultimately be is unclear .	-4.6903
It is not his intention , however , to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .	-3.5419
He likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .	-2.1867
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat , the son of a French noble family , Margrethe met in London in 1965 .	-2.5860
He worked on the theme in the French Embassy .	-2.5005
During his later wife , Prince Henrik had a hard time with the Danes in his nearly 50-year rule .	-6.7161
In an autobiography , Henrik said about the first years in Denmark : ' A few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticized .	-3.8548
My Danish was fluctuating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of knitted socks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-2.5405
Even for the Gauloises , who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation here for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals , I could not hope for forbearance .	-4.9278
I was different .	-1.0737
I seemed to be satisfied with that position and not to be ashamed .	-3.2911
These were two mistakes ! '	-2.5374
Prime Minister Weil wants a speedy re-election	-3.0598
The CDU and the FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony	-2.8576
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority , but he does not want to resign .	-4.5793
Because on Friday it was in favour of the dissolution of Parliament .	-3.3299
Previously , the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her Lower Saxony party had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a serious crisis .	-4.2007
Five months before the official election date , the Red-Green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow single-vote majority in parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-4.7764
Elke Twesten , a former Green MEP , based her move on the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-5.0651
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-2.2833
Christian Democrat leader Björn Thümler would recommend to his group that it be included .	-4.0603
This would give the CDU and the FDP a total of 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , the SPD and the Greens 68 seats .	-5.3584
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-1.8839
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-3.8996
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.5105
Stephan Weil , however , considers it essential that the Landtag decide to dissolve itself as quickly as possible .	-5.4889
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is expected to decide on on Tuesday the report .	-5.1498
The constitution also provides for the possibility of the parliament withdrawing trust from the Prime Minister and electing a successor .	-4.7934
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.6437
These possibilities need to be examined in a legally clean manner , " said Thümler .	-5.4876
'All questions will be discussed calmly if they are properly examined in law ' .	-5.3986
Thümler called Twestens Schritt " doch etwas kurios " .	-1.9620
The politician herself emphasised : " I am not a traitor .	-2.3461
I feel very good ' .	-1.0839
She was a supporter of black green .	-3.8446
The Greens called on the separatist MEPs to return their country 's mandate .	-4.2754
" We assume , of course , that she will return with immediate effect the mandate she received from the Green Country List , " said the regional presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-6.6101
The chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Anja Piel , said : ' We greatly regret the decision taken by Elke Twesten ' .	-4.0187
She has deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group .	-2.6995
'Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . '	-4.5657
The SPD Chancellor ’ s candidate Martin Schulz denounces Elke Twesten , a Green deputy from Lower Saxony , as a betrayal of the CDU .	-5.8686
" The behaviour of the former Green deputies in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters , but also betrayal of the Red Green , " wrote the German Social Democrats leader on Friday on Facebook .	-5.2171
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to re-elect the parliament quickly .	-3.2708
Leaving Twestens costs the majority of the Red Green in Lower Saxony .	-3.7441
The politician , " in her wounded vanity and frustration , puts her personal interests before the good of the country , " criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil .	-4.7150
" It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to make political capital out of it " .	-3.8097
The head of the CDU in Lower Saxony , Björn Thümler , will recommend to his deputies that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU .	-4.1449
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of using personal careers to distort the outcome of the 2013 general election .	-4.6021
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD , but the SPD and the Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament .	-4.6909
Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.7159
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.8975
How did the scandal happen ?	-1.6364
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.0872
Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) , Minister of Agriculture , is speaking and answering in an interview with the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-4.9308
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.6238
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print .	-3.2446
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de the federal states provide the latest information on the respective eggs batches .	-5.1706
The eggs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-2.8436
Even if , according to everything we know at the moment , there is virtually no danger to health .	-4.6543
Does Aldi now accept the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the Federal Minister of the Economy does not really perceive the central role of the enlightened ?	-5.2945
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states .	-3.3111
Nevertheless , my House immediately turned its attention and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became aware of Germany 's concern .	-6.7750
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.1134
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe to transport .	-4.9628
If eggs exceed the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg , they are not transportable .	-4.0736
However , uncontaminated eggs can be sold and consumed .	-2.8306
This time it is not the companies that are to blame .	-2.6556
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?	-2.7785
According to the current state of knowledge , the production companies are not directly to blame .	-4.8185
On the contrary , they have to reckon with economic damage as a result of alleged illegal practices by service companies . are . are . are , , , , ,	-7.5225
As always , there are too few inspectors in case of emergency .	-3.3756
Is it simply a lack of staff or even of conclusive competence ?	-4.8898
It was precisely the official controls that uncovered the process .	-3.3368
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 % .	-3.1266
It is precisely for this reason that it is crucial to provide consistent information on such events and to pass it on to the public prosecutors in cases where there may be criminal offences .	-6.5752
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the authorities responsible .	-3.5755
Is it really necessary to keep food scandals on a regular basis ?	-4.2166
Consumers have the right to have only safe and transport food .	-6.6300
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.6970
The muddled means have put producers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-4.3165
In principle , it must be made clear that the illegal use of Fipronil insecticide in keeping food suppliers is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-5.1933
This must be done consistently and with great pressure at all levels .	-3.3221
I expect all the competent authorities to provide speedy and complete information .	-4.5839
How Football ’ s Financial Rules Impact Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-2.1496
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spain ’ s Barcelona to France ’ s Paris-Saint Germain .	-3.7638
There will be some consequences for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA , because the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-4.9003
Financial fair play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar ’ s transfer was financed with little loss .	-4.0884
Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract , and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year .	-3.4017
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.5321
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signs up and takes him into a galaxy of other stars , given the team ’ s funding from the energy-rich Qatar ruling family .	-5.8785
Clubs may spend a lot of money on buying players , but must counteract with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break even in their soccer business .	-5.8296
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.4668
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-4.5788
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.2771
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - buying a potentially strong club and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher business .	-4.2179
During the current three-year FFP hiring period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .	-3.1436
And , while Platini was disgraced by the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , remains committed to discouraging excessive spending .	-3.1424
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-4.2170
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a lump sum , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .	-3.5512
Neymar has signed a five-year contract , so that the replacement fee for the next five years , amounting to EUR 44.4 million , can be recorded in the annual accounts .	-5.4025
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , who holds Manchester City , struck the PSG with the most severe sanctions .	-4.0785
The PSG received a fine of € 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .	-5.0284
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outlist their financial supervision by blowing up their revenues from companies associated with club owners .	-5.5150
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates , UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income .	-3.6422
This is exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.6783
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments could come to Neymar via payments made by the World Cup Organization Committee in 2022 .	-4.1957
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and that such a maneuver could easily be found for UEFA regulators .	-3.7346
Previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.6105
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.3201
They spoke to The Associated Press under anonymity , as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.5749
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.9721
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published .	-2.8528
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising , and jersey sales .	-2.6599
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-3.6339
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.2217
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of the La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's eventual ownership of PSG .	-3.2053
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is owned by an American sports team , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .	-3.7276
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.2265
" As soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.1666
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-4.4835
Swiss is Looking for a New Shoggilist	-3.9372
In recent years Chocolat Frey has produced Bord chocolate for Swiss .	-8.6531
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to a possible end : the airline rewrites the order .	-5.7380
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper " North-West Switzerland " from Friday .	-3.4561
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.7655
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-3.2961
" We are very pleased with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.5076
Approximately 17 million small red and white shock panels of 14 grams per year distribute the cabin crew to the passengers prior to landing .	-6.1283
The Swiss did not want to provide information on the costs .	-3.5089
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to " North-West Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss Francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss Francs .	-5.1477
But what is more important is the advertising effect : for a shoe manufacturer it is a prestigious order .	-4.7445
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender .	-5.5124
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-4.2973
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .	-2.7764
For sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-3.2766
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate tables on board its flights since 2006 .	-3.0406
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with Migros ’ daughter , Barry Callebaut , in collaboration with Hug , had delivered the chocolate tablets .	-3.8547
Two and a half years ago , Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo with Chocolat Frey .	-3.0051
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.5121
On long-haul flights , First Class customers will be spoiled with delicacies from the Sprüngli Confiserie , in Business Class from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey .	-5.2123
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed by Chocolat Frey on the short-haul route , both in business and economy class .	-5.6029
athletics - Discussion Olympic Champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals	-4.0023
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday .	-4.1096
His brother Christoph , the 2016 Olympics winner , had failed in the national World Cup squeeze , and could only look at the discus race from the gallery .	-6.7092
Also with the first attempt , the Polish defender Piotr Malachowski , who threw 65.13 meters wide , qualified for the final fight .	-4.2446
Nostalgia goes into the niche of " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " .	-2.3854
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90s Grunge era ( when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd , went on to make larger things .	-5.4944
As a cultural artefact it is also a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-2.8020
But as a franchise , it feels like time is running out .	-2.2428
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables , spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.5532
By getting stuck to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless made it impossible to win back the last part of the joke .	-6.2153
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more by the scattering principle , including a reef on the Stalker movies of the 90s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " .	-5.0905
At one point , a character groves through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.6790
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.3170
The loving Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now novelist , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-2.7299
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.5029
And there is another crazy malicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.8318
As always , the courses are the best part of the franchise .	-2.8098
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's beard of " Singles " , whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old crackdown .	-5.1789
These are the moments of accidental madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeated " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , the last scene of which the bands will show how they will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-5.3774
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War by " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its east-west wrestling iconography .	-8.0123
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism .	-3.9588
The main characters - a hardened Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English .	-3.8470
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.2956
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.2928
There are some nice gags to watch ( the police spend time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .	-4.4850
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of ' Find the Voice out ' .	-2.9039
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like one .	-3.1156
In six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-4.2033
" Comrade Detective " , edited to a lesser length , could better deliver his agitprop series , as Gregor and Iosef visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers .	-6.5187
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed a jelly .	-3.7458
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong : we are even doing it with our own recent history and with theirs .	-2.8661
Killing Drug Mafia in the Land	-3.4075
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-3.0226
On Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district , Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosecutor ’ s office in Konstanz announced on Friday .	-4.1018
15 accused people aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants were issued against them .	-5.0144
The officials also secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine , firearms , and several hundred thousand euros .	-2.9374
At the same time , two people were arrested in Italy .	-3.1047
There were German arrest warrants against the two Italian suspects .	-2.9983
The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany .	-3.3622
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.2893
In total , more than 300 police officers were deployed .	-3.3871
The Mafia 's members are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , robbery and blackmail .	-4.6798
Since summer 2016 , the prosecutor ’ s office has been investigating Konstanz against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-3.5351
The prosecutors in Constance and Palermo were in close contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.7669
That is why the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four Palermo officials .	-3.8422
The investigation was directed mainly by Italian nationals closely related to the Italian mafia .	-4.8233
Another incident in Hüfingen on 27 May , during which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to be the result of the gang .	-5.7075
There are major gaps in the foreign register .	-5.0604
" Data from citizens who should not appear there " : According to a report , the register of foreigners in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-6.1964
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-3.2194
According to a media report , the Federal Government ’ s representative for the management of refugees , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to major gaps in the central register of foreigners .	-10.8546
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to ' sometimes serious mistakes ' in asylum procedures and deportations , warned in an analysis presented in the ' Süddeutsche Zeitung ' .	-6.0220
According to the data , the register contains ten million people of foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.1364
The data is therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.4583
Because the data was not maintained sufficiently , the quality of the data has not been good in parts .	-4.7461
In individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , ' by people who are no longer alive or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should not actually appear in the register ' .	-5.4814
" Incorrect data input can slow back processes considerably , " the report goes on .	-4.9949
Moreover , statistics on people who are forced to leave include EU citizens who do not need to leave .	-8.6953
However , such false allocations ' led to a distorted debate on how to deal with those who have to leave ' , according to the analysis .	-6.7453
Meanwhile , the federal government appears to have begun sending refugee families with under 16 years of age back to Italy once they have arrived from there .	-4.7515
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-3.4080
The paper therefore states that the BAMF ' has been carrying out such procedures for families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-5.8824
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014 , according to the newspaper , referring to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.6804
Under the Dublin Convention , refugees are the responsibility of the EU state , which they first reach .	-3.1892
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that country can send him back to the country of entry .	-3.2645
To justify this , the office now writes : ' In the meantime , the absorption capacity of families with underage children has increased significantly in Italy ' .	-6.0923
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.4874
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.2073
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.4240
Ulla Jelpke , the spokesperson for domestic politics in the Bundestag , criticized this decision : " Families with children are threatened with inadequacies in the Italian asylum system and with inhumane reception conditions and a threat to children 's welfare " .	-6.6885
Second best result achieved	-2.0005
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided the blood donation service to other people .	-3.5817
At least among the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-3.8139
First of all , Jürgen Greule , who , with his now 100 donations , now shared 50 litres of blood .	-5.0512
Traditionally , at the meeting of the Council of the Municipalities , the municipality acknowledges the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-6.1919
" It is brilliant how our body is designed for this purpose and we respect the donors who provide their blood for strangers , not to mention altruistic , " underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.7167
" A single donation of blood helps several people , " explained Holger Maisenbacher , the district governor of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , for the cannons are crushed into their constituents .	-6.3927
Three people could benefit from blood donation .	-3.7863
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring .	-3.2102
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the head of the DRK Association .	-4.6688
Apparently , the change to the theatre house led to higher attendance numbers a few years ago .	-4.8817
Before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 donations each .	-3.4219
Half as many Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger stayed , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave them 500 milliliters each of their life .	-4.6685
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 % .	-1.3160
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation slowdown have dampened speculation about rising .	-3.6747
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " by maintaining interest rates on family income in the midst of intensifying pressure .	-3.6274
Bank Monetary Committee ( MPC ) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-4.1160
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % , and for 2018 to 1.6 % , warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation expected to rise to close to 3 % in the autumn .	-3.7655
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the next few years to rein in Brexit ’ s fueled inflation , and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.1740
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-3.4204
It will call for time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - GBP 115 billion sterling .	-5.2082
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the MPC 's central forecast , GDP remains weak in the short run , as pressure on real household incomes continues to impede consumption . "	-5.7638
On interest rates , she reiterated that ' some tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' slightly greater ' level than the markets expect .	-4.7936
Markets are forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.6934
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-3.0600
The Bank ’ s downward adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next year are relative to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-3.3908
It has kept its growth forecast at 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.2111
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .	-2.8873
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 , falling by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-2.1347
The decision cannot be changed after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest-rate hike , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the second quarter .	-4.6638
Growth is expected to reach 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the bank at the end of the year .	-3.5959
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage increases , because the tightening first gets worse before it gets better .	-5.3734
She added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " the loss of income in the next few years , but she added that wages will recover " significantly " at the end of her three-year forecast .	-5.2535
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will offset part of lower consumer spending .	-3.3869
The decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .	-2.7538
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve this fully in terms of prices and the economy .	-3.1358
Prior to the Bank ’ s latest judgment on interest rates , the call for an interest-rate hike had risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-4.9420
Inflation fell last month , from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and that it will recover in the coming months .	-4.1860
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its 2 % target was ' entirely ' attributable to the weak pound .	-4.4017
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders are clamoring for deals and want to end the year in a positive way .	-4.6339
The market looks particularly good for those who end the existing deals and make the new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more popular . '	-5.4879
The National Health Service ( NHS ) is to prescribe a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people .	-3.5046
Patients will have access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September onwards , following a fight in front of the High Court against funding for the drug in the NHS . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.1697
NHS England announced that preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) taken before intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-9.3189
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it .	-4.8288
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as " an important new intervention , " while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called it a " decisive moment . "	-4.6422
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be launched across England in April 2018 .	-6.5549
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.4746
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection .	-2.2306
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person ’ s body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.0224
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-3.3056
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .	-2.6933
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , transgender , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.6063
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-4.0538
The program will be £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .	-2.6243
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as targeted , absorbed , and implemented on a large scale .	-4.9796
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.0163
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in tackling one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . '	-3.5281
Deborah Gold , chief executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-6.5314
PrEP , if targeted at people in need and danger , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.5984
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is genuinely individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which will improve many , many lives .	-4.7660
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.9069
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly throughout the country and for no one who is at risk of HIV to be left behind .	-4.8148
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are well on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-4.8682
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government .	-3.7433
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-2.6924
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-3.1922
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us move one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.3693
Living the Great Life : The mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-7.6995
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to an Earls Court apartment .	-2.5994
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags .	-3.0570
" Before that I lived with my ex-in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-3.2240
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .	-2.3794
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.1765
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . '	-2.1861
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken .	-4.0281
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the spacious ceilings .	-4.3308
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.4054
That was my requirement , " she says .	-1.8091
To this end , she asked Erfan Azadi ’ s Duck & Shed Architecture and Design studio in Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Joanne .	-8.4727
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand .	-3.6997
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement .	-2.3836
" The steel mill is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.5802
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to put ourselves together .	-4.5987
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-6.1798
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other in full height , with a lot of drama .	-4.4390
For the mezzanine floor , a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area .	-2.8510
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.5390
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-2.0165
On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer .	-3.6741
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-3.0588
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses from Joanne .	-3.0042
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.6785
Folding kitchens are nothing new .	-2.7406
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.9964
" A bit of engineering art went there , " explains Erfan of the steel reinforced , veneered MDF door .	-4.9531
'It is counterweight so that when you push the door up , it slides very easily ' .	-7.7942
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne gained an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.4550
" At the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is estimated , " Erfan says .	-4.3315
'In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter into a calculation based on the size of the land ' .	-4.1555
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.4277
" The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.6577
" You do not fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.8438
They are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.3829
It shows that a flat can turn from something standard to something quite amazing due to good design and increased square meters .	-5.7611
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-2.1267
Brothers Fight for a $ 500 million Real Estate Imperial	-2.9837
Two brothers are in conflict four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , over $ 500 million worth of one of Victorian ’ s largest real-estate empire .	-4.6262
Former director of the Carlton football club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared .	-4.3235
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a clash over separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-4.4977
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 homes worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a store on Smith Street , Collingwood , in 1973 .	-3.8379
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.7639
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.2516
This money has been invested in real estate , and De Lutis ’ portfolio now includes urban offices , Brunswick and Sorrento development areas , Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments , and suburban shopping centers .	-3.9711
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company 's assets and Paul about a third .	-4.5206
According to a legal act , this means that Colin owns $ 316 million worth of property and Paul $ 176 million worth .	-8.3556
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-6.4600
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects , " he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015 .	-3.2928
Last Friday , after several failed mediations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.8066
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - from which Colin , as Paul claims , excluded him .	-4.5804
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of administering some possessions incompetently .	-2.4757
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-2.9380
" My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.6886
Costs will rise in this case , with hundreds of Affidavits , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-5.0084
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a Brunswick shop in the early 1970s .	-3.5530
They used the security to buy the Collingwood store where Colin opened the family 's first jeans shop .	-3.7062
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was " in my last years high school , when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.7187
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons .	-1.8498
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , " she wrote .	-2.5648
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis Group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when he left the company .	-9.0057
Both Lukas and Mark , Paul says , have become embittered about the terms of their financial separation .	-4.2966
Colin was very reticent , even though he was a former AFL board member and , after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , the best friend of the TV star .	-4.4025
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.3844
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I really cannot say much " because the case was before the courts .	-3.7943
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our surname through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.9925
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.5677
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said , adding that he " still hopes for a solution " .	-3.3000
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.7170
" Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts , " wrote Colin .	-2.4046
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-1.8538
Others tried and failed .	-1.4791
Perhaps John F. Kelly can .	-1.8845
If so , he will be the first .	-1.3309
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course .	-4.0606
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.9463
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met senior executives on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to fix : bad information that comes into the president ’ s hands .	-4.9540
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . "	-3.9935
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.4398
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.9094
" When candidate Trump was angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of posts that were to be persuaded , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February .	-5.5920
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that , " the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption is consistently praised . "	-4.1210
Okay .	-1.0529
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit was ever " under control " is ridiculous .	-6.0455
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we others do not know – that without their interventions , Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel .	-4.3659
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.6985
If his colleagues have managed to keep him out of trouble several times , their efforts have paid off .	-4.4372
But no one has been consistent in preventing Trump from provoking controversy .	-2.7505
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing parties , people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting material to Trump that may promote their views from the world .	-3.7168
Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the advisers ' preference to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-5.0149
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-2.1067
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press clips , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is keen to find out where they come from .	-4.5227
This was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson ’ s website , accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a bunch of leaks " in the White House .	-4.3645
Although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter for harassment , or has offered no concrete evidence , or has made false accusations and revoked them in the past .	-4.3055
Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh . "	-2.9583
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter “ tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives . ”	-3.0414
How did this work ?	-1.3111
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .	-1.8605
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than primebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-3.2862
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.1805
Europol 's mail to the most sought after criminals	-4.7758
Since the address is unknown , the support of the population is being sought and hoped for .	-4.7168
Police across Europe this summer sends ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .	-3.8283
As the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are by definition unknown , evidence from the population is hoped for and requested .	-6.7389
Europol reported on Friday the action following the ' EU Most Wanted ' winter advent calendar .	-3.7230
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations , as Europol said .	-4.1403
21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .	-3.5591
Since 2016 the website www.eumostwanted exists , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .	-3.5045

Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the Millionaires series .	-3.0640
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are once again at war with some determined travellers who negotiated a ditch drawn from the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions .	-5.3654
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy Solihull street called the " Millionärs " series .	-4.2909
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May , but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their incursions .	-4.7070
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained untouched to find a way .	-4.4238
Angry residents have afflicted the advice of Solihull , who said that ' it is useless to deal with the problem ' .	-4.1255
An anonymous resident said : " They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on passers-by .	-4.6001
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it has been useless in dealing with the problem .	-3.9171
Travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back .	-3.6634
More came last night , probably more today . '	-2.8590
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by making long instructions to protect its parks .	-4.1160
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-2.2222
A resident who did not want to be called said : ' It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-4.2160
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . '	-3.5686
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and we are working with the Solihull police and we are taking the necessary legal steps to move forward as quickly as possible .	-5.6379
In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 . .	-8.1062
This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the Court will have to examine when we will present our case . '	-5.1547
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise .	-1.7319
The Waldhotel Luise becomes the former Hotel Birkenhof .	-2.9429
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year .	-8.4832
This is good news for the city .	-1.3577
After all , with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH as of 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time and income from the spa tax was also lost .	-5.5566
In the autumn of 2014 , with dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the councillor ’ s office as a collective shelter , causing controversy .	-6.7540
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.3694
The decision was not uncontroversial in the municipal council .	-3.4663
But Freudenstadt ’ s Lord Mayor , Julian Osswald , defended the hotel ’ s location and spoke of serious interest in the hotel back then .	-5.8405
He should be right .	-1.3920
The Luisenhotels Group , with its managing director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has bought the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star plus hotel under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-5.5243
The group has four houses with the pleasure city object .	-3.3114
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.3907
They are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.2206
At the former Hotel Birkenhof building waste containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out .	-5.9405
The floors were removed , ceilings partly removed , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-4.5404
The entire hotel building is a single building .	-2.6413
Much remains to be done by March .	-2.2203
" It 's actually a beautiful hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-3.0676
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-3.2035
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed .	-3.7285
Everything should later become " beautifully close to the citizen " , as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-4.7932
'We want to make a jewel out of it ' .	-3.2967
Swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room are all equipped . .	-6.0249
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but already at a higher level of the inner city , Scherer emphasizes .	-6.1438
The Waldhotel Luise , with its 60 rooms , aims to set itself wide , explains Scherer .	-5.8639
Individual holidaymakers , groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel .	-4.2128
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause , according to Scherer .	-2.4598
The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.4393
'We are on the same line ' .	-2.3074
Asked about the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise .	-4.2128
Less than a million euros , he calculates .	-3.8302
The outside areas are also being brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .	-6.9712
A large terrace is created in the courtyard , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-5.0425
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-2.1439
Russia affair : United States Special Counsel sets up the Grand Jury	-3.9665
In the Russia affair involving US President Donald Trump , Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reported to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury .	-3.9712
The panel has started work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal , citing people familiar with the issue .	-4.9244
The newspaper viewed the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation .	-3.2532
The CNN channel reported that there are already preliminary subpoenas of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-4.0434
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-2.1613
Mueller is investigating whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-2.6772
The investigation will focus on several men who campaigned as Republican advisers .	-3.7426
Mueller has reportedly been more and more scrutinizing Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.8595
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Trump , the special counselor , had put himself at the center and investigated whether the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair .	-6.1885
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to bring charges .	-4.9914
Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Chambers of Appeal .	-3.9680
Most of the time they are switched on when there are major and controversial cases .	-4.9482
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .	-1.9550
The board can also be consulted by the public prosecutor to invite people to interrogate under oath .	-4.4995
According to the CNN channel , lectures have already been issued on the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.7362
People who took part in the meeting were asked to make a statement , as the report says .	-4.3144
They should also provide documents .	-1.1985
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and his campaign chief , Paul Manafort , were on the conversation .	-4.2400
On Thursday evening , legal experts said on US television that the appointment shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary .	-5.2304
However , it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be consulted at the end in order to decide whether to bring an indictment .	-5.8565
Nevertheless , the establishment of the panel is the start of a new phase in the investigation and a new source of concern for President Trump .	-4.8474
Amid the new revelations , the president used a speech on Thursday evening in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-3.0355
" Russia 's history is a complete invention , " Trump said .	-1.9559
The issue gives the democrats a chance to ' feel good because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-3.7505
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , stated in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.3476
But they usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-4.4300
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Counsel in a ' fair ' way .	-4.5370
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that the president is not being investigated .	-3.5000
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , the statement continued .	-4.6566
But Mueller was only deployed after Trump fired Comey .	-2.7539
Trump had been accused of obstructing the judiciary because of this overthrow .	-5.7746
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.0814
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.2844
According to US media , the White House collected material against the Special Counsel and its staff .	-3.9520
That triggered speculation about whether Trump would sack Mueller .	-3.3988
Unlike an independent congressional special envoy , such as the Watergate affair surrounding later retired President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which , theoretically , at the president ’ s insistence , he could be fired by the Ministry of Justice .	-4.9988
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-3.4947
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Thursday that would make it less easy to dismiss the Special Counsel .	-4.8284
Antarctica ’ s Gigantic Ice Mountain Drives in Antarctica	-2.7320
In the Western Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has got rid of its shell .	-5.6494
This was announced on Wednesday by the Bremen Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research .	-2.8633
The colossus weighing more than one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-4.7028
It is one of the largest ice giants registered by researchers over the past three decades , with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres .	-3.6373
It does not pose a danger to people .	-3.0310
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear according to research .	-3.5618
Overall , however , there has been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice cubes in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a background of facts .	-5.1940
According to many researchers , this could be linked to global warming .	-2.9085
The colossus that has now been aborted has been part of the larsen-C shell .	-5.4850
Schelfeis swim on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-3.1470
It grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly .	-4.7720
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-4.6509
To the north of this shell , the balance of growth and breaking was disturbed some years ago .	-7.6936
A complete shell has broken up there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-3.8554
There is a lot to be said about the fact that the larsen-C shell is also in danger , because the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is today .	-7.9520
In addition , the ice sheet is under stress and may collapse if a piece of ice breaks off at a key point .	-6.4450
The melting of the shell and iceberg does not raise the sea level , as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it does after melting .	-6.0644
However , the loss of the skeleton ice means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .	-6.0400
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the UK ’ s Midas research project .	-4.4419
According to AWI-data , the Larsen-C skeleton is the fourth largest skeleton in the Antarctic with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-5.9159
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters .	-4.4799
There it stops regularly .	-3.1950
" Although it is natural and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary of Swansea University in the UK .	-4.1808
" This is the furthest withdrawal since records began , " he also confirmed .	-3.0877
Among scientists , it is contentious whether the Larsen-C shell will now grow again or fall in the long term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Luckman , adding : ' Our models say it will be less stable ' .	-6.9081
But it will take decades .	-2.0008
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , a great many icebergs of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades .	-3.9142
This long tip of the Antarctic stretches towards South America .	-3.1135
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the Antarctic Peninsula 's ice surface has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.1694
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-2.9011
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the last 50 years , making it one of the areas where temperature is rising fastest .	-4.7194
CDU ’ s Household Tariff for Personnel	-4.5318
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant posts , the CDU is calling for the resignation of the employers ' association in order to become more attractive .	-5.1227
Just before the summer recess , the Kreistag has completed 41 new administrative posts .	-5.1451
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.8804
Now 17 apprentices have their first day of work behind them .	-3.9962
The apprenticeships at the district are obviously very much in demand .	-5.0401
Approximately 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year .	-4.1057
However , the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .	-4.6194
At present there are still 50 unfilled posts in the Mettmann circle .	-3.8751
Doctors and engineers as well as general administration staff are requested .	-4.8932
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the district parliament and to address the shortage of skilled workers in administration .	-7.2121
In accordance with the wishes of the parties , the administration shall " develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development " .	-7.7781
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers , but to counteract the shortage of candidates in the future , it is said .	-5.4059
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , should show concrete measures for cross-frontier entrants and should include a training offensive , CDU , FDP and UWG demand .	-6.9147
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.0494
After all , the circle is dealing with personnel problems that were previously unknown .	-5.9362
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.6544
There is talk of real ' competition between public employers ' .	-3.1399
In addition , there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-4.8133
It is therefore high time to act so that more jobs do not remain vacant .	-4.2805
But Klaus-Dieter Völker , the leader of the CDU group , and his party go beyond the joint motion .	-7.5273
He recently caused a fistful surprise in the district parliament when he publicly questioned the staffing ceiling and startled the other parties .	-7.7435
Peoples want to see a review of all the possibilities that allow them to leave the local employers ' association .	-6.1174
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the district administration should seek a house tariff with the trade unions , perhaps also in cooperation with the nearby cities , " says peoples .	-7.3853
In this way , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the collective agreement for the public service actually provides for .	-5.4357
Wages are currently strictly prescribed , and increases or more money can only be achieved by moving to a higher level , based on years of work .	-6.5843
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown ever more in recent years .	-4.3232
Only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on the protection of prostitution .	-4.5943
Not least because of the increase in the number of asylum seekers , Councillor Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-4.0892
Italy Strengthening the Mind of NGO Migrant Rescue Bo	-4.7991
Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue unless they adhere to new rules for their operations .	-3.3614
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa .	-2.8558
Minniti 's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rettet aid organisation , because its team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.3968
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor , Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.2142
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in a statement on the social media .	-4.9989
'We cannot judge any allegations currently made until we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-4.3718
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of ' Youth Rettet ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.2803
It is suspected that its crew will take on board migrants who are supplied directly by human traffickers , and that smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be reused .	-6.7760
At least such a meeting was supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosecutor ’ s file , the content of which was published by Italian media .	-4.0856
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian coastguard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason .	-4.0815
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities .	-3.3374
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta , and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.6468
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring about ' major changes or obstacles ' of their rescue operations .	-4.5475
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner is Médecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ) .	-2.5459
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescue operations has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libya ’ s coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.4724
" In recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.7045
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-2.7747
Upgrades and Trials	-1.6778
Nine Weilermer Bikers , the " Berlin Outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-3.3636
Three friendly guides were available for this .	-2.8872
Accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-3.0021
The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome addition .	-2.8605
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-3.5054
It was followed by observation points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains .	-5.7552
In between , there have always been prolonged increases for which long trials have been rewarded .	-4.1014
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and to the folk feast sausage market .	-4.5633
Once again , the viewpoint stood at the viewpoint , connected by " floating " trials and moderate climbs .	-6.2082
On the last two days , a lot of altitude meters were planned .	-6.0629
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and caves brought welcome breaks .	-2.2232
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers breathed salt in the open-air inhalatory .	-3.9795
New Town has also been fired .	-3.8550
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group got to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .	-4.7089
Console instead of grass - Bundesliga is Arming for E-Sport	-4.1421
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of having to fight over the stadium pits in the wind and weather ?	-7.3214
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - including big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high profits .	-4.7369
This is also recognised by the first Bundesliga leagues , which are increasingly committed to this area .	-5.2992
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015 , followed by FC Schalke 04 and , most recently , VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .	-6.2142
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB " , says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.8064
He is sure that " there are still a number of clubs on this train " .	-5.9368
Next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London is organising the first Interactive Club World Cup , where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other .	-5.9798
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-2.9598
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports .	-1.5248
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.4052
" Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds in particular , that young people will continue to enter the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-5.3474
And : The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially Asian ones .	-3.5914
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , you could be present on these markets online much more often than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year .	-5.8703
What exactly is this about ?	-2.0576
In e-sports , computer games such as League of Legends , Dota 2 , Counterstrike or FIFA football simulation are fought at competitive level .	-4.6191
As in normal sport , leagues have long established themselves in which professionals compete against each other .	-4.6017
And E-Sport is already part of the official program for Asian games in 2022 .	-3.2425
But is it really a sport ?	-3.0252
For many , the idea certainly needs to be used .	-3.7778
Ingo Froböse also dealt with the question for a long time .	-3.2284
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - e.g. increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.7352
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and rapid response capability .	-3.3370
Professional gamers should not only train at the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .	-4.2905
'The fit player is a good player ' .	-2.3254
But Froböse also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-2.9980
Controls were difficult to implement in online games , and the structures of classical sport were lacking in the scene .	-4.8992
On the positive side , the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-4.4435
The players are on the international stage , which is like a big global family , and there are no intercultural barriers .	-5.3388
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth in e-sports .	-3.3983
In 2016 , this amounted to € 50 million in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship , and major tournaments .	-4.1471
In three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .	-3.6860
This is not the case with the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the football league .	-6.7407
However , e-sport is " not far away from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey , " the Deloitte consultants write .	-4.7053
Many countries are already on the international stage .	-3.5001
Major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-baseball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-3.1203
Hollywood actress Ashton Kutcher invests in the e-sports betting provider Unikrn .	-2.7031
There are also things happening in Europe .	-3.2042
In a Norwegian school e-sport has been introduced as a subject of instruction , says Froböse . . , , , , , , , , , , , and . , , ,	-7.9011
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-3.3452
" Germany is lagging behind in the European comparison , " explains VfB-Executive Board Röttgermann .	-3.8722
It is no longer enough to fall into nostalgia , and to paralyse the old times .	-6.0000
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company with the modern market .	-4.2562
" We live in a digitized world , " says Dutt .	-2.2126
'You cannot hold on to the fact that only football is the way it has always been ' .	-6.2414
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking	-2.8089
Almost all the Länder are now affected by the poisoned eggs scandal .	-3.6654
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and removed all eggs from the sale throughout Germany .	-3.6246
Only eggs are to be placed on the shelves that have proven to contain no fipronil .	-6.1780
Michelle Carter has been convicted of the texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide .	-4.1180
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .	-3.1024
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months condemning them behind bars and five years have been suspended .	-2.5229
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on July 13 , 2014 .	-2.3787
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : ' My family is unblemished .	-3.3164
My son was my best friend . '	-0.8571
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal .	-2.8079
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had a mental illness .	-7.2889
Closed in red trousers and a cream blouse , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands , and downward eyed eyes when she was convicted .	-8.3137
" Your actions have killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutor told the court .	-2.7605
" She ended his life to make her own better .	-2.0201
She did not take responsibility , " she said .	-2.5677
'She has shown no remorse ' .	-2.1350
But Carter 's lawyer said it was " a terrible circumstance that she deeply deplores . "	-4.8854
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not find out that their ' age , maturity or even mental illness have a significant impact on their actions ' .	-3.2640
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy ’ s mother , Lynn Roy , saying that “ there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son .	-3.6887
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything , and I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we will bear for eternity , " he says .	-5.6670
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would be " persecuted " by the realization that she would never attend her brother 's wedding or be a aunt for his children .	-3.7789
" Not having this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-4.4480
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.5914
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.1803
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that it had encouraged him to end his life .	-2.6133
" Hang up , spring from a building , swallow yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .	-4.4721
In the moments before his suicide , she wrote : ' You have to do it , Conrad ' and ' All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-3.5299
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from the case through any press .	-3.3850
The case has divided the legal opinion .	-2.1411
Among the few who defended Carter were Amanda Knox , convicted in 2007 of murders of her fellow British citizen in Italy , before being released two years ago .	-4.1746
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not imprisonment ' .	-3.1539
Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the FC Bayern Mini-Lahm	-3.0496
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to be a captain at the Audi Cup .	-3.8846
The FC Bayern believes the Confed-Cup winner has a great season - there is no harm to any extra motivation .	-7.1298
Something else was there on his seat in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even though the extra garment was very , very small .	-4.0871
But since no Philipp Lahm was seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup and no Manuel Neuer was seen either , he made the binding to him .	-7.1182
" The coach has not announced it " , the Confed-Cup winner told us after his first assignment as Bavarian capital .	-5.7229
Well , the booth could have been better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC of Naples .	-5.2571
But Kimmich could interpret the sign of the coach as well .	-3.8204
It was not Arturo Vidal , who was eight years old , who was chosen to play in the C-Elf , which was made up of youth players , debutants and professionals who had just come out of the holiday .	-10.9924
It is preferable to distribute sugar to those who are trusted to have a great deal of pleasure .	-7.0614
So if you were chosen to take up the legacy of Lahm , you can only use a small extra motivation .	-5.8850
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-3.2290
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flipped over the field as a mini lamb .	-4.7277
Right back , that 's its position now , the white tie on the arm did the rest .	-5.3268
And Kimmich even worked like the one who can best take the helmet in this starter formation .	-7.8962
He gave instructions , tried to steer the unplayed troop .	-3.9528
He looked at the whole thing , while many others looked at himself .	-4.7231
Vidal was playing his lack of fitness ( barely worked ) ; Renato Sanches was hitting out with the achievements of the Asia trip ( only conditional ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did not turn out negatively in their first appearance in the Bavarian thriller .	-9.3632
After all , that worked very well .	-5.6217
Süle ran next to Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acting sovereign .	-3.3414
The famous Napoli Storm was often difficult , and Süle also tried to succeed a few times in the construction of the game .	-10.3338
His colleague , Mr Rudy , admittedly admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped it would be ' .	-3.9653
But he , too , showed a good performance at the debut .	-4.0324
Relocation of the game , change of tempo : " I was brought up for this style " .	-5.9825
After the match , we saw how unusual this Bavarian world is for the new entrants .	-5.4157
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two in the catacombs , but certainly six or seven interviews .	-3.0807
Kimmich quit after a few tough statements in the back of his new fellow players .	-5.6882
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " I have already noticed what goes on here .	-4.4648
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game " .	-3.2380
After all , he no longer has to teach the new .	-2.6847
Alaba Motivates Austrian Women	-1.8271
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies	-2.1349
Austria ’ s most famous footballer registered on Twitter just before the match and wished the ÖFB-ladies well .	-8.8082
The Bavarian regional is almost a club member of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is fevering with our Ladys .	-5.2458
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winners should be a special injection of motivation .	-3.9528
Our ladies may well need the famous Bavarian shower .	-3.5543
Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissings Tempo	-3.4152
It was often irreconcilable , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economics at Rheinland-Palatinate .	-7.1684
This is apparent after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-3.7911
At T V , chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy - and at the same time accuse the old minister .	-5.1736
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association Trierer Unternehmen ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing picks up the wishes of the economy , which Lemke has all blocked " .	-3.8579
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy : closing the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now high on the country ’ s priority list .	-4.8160
This year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure to be followed , and construction law will be in place by 2021 .	-6.9051
The West Trier bypass also plays a role in the country ’ s plans , which is the primary requirement of the federal transport route plan .	-5.8667
The aim is to start the route in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.5313
Natus sees this as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.6085
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine , as suggested by Wissing , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been taking off for ten years .	-6.1951
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , praising the IHK .	-7.6472
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-4.0026
It is planned to receive a premium of EUR 1000 for the completed master examination and EUR 2500 if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master training .	-7.0919
But the country ’ s homework list remains a long one .	-7.2026
The plan to build a road quickly creates facts and at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier .	-6.3731
Of 56 new engineers who want to hire mobility at the national plant , up to now only 29 jobs have been filled .	-5.0775
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .	-3.7203
Christian Baldauf , the CDU Group vize , points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that in 2017 and 2018 , the country will invest more than EUR 20 million less in maintaining roads than proposed .	-5.6345
Frank Natus also expects a country ’ s concept of how to address the region ’ s shortage of skilled workers .	-4.3117
It is also sobering that the country has so far expanded its broadband network .	-5.6521
In 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an IHK survey with only a 3.4 rating .	-5.2524
They complained about stalling Internet connections and breakdowns .	-3.4700
On the other hand , former Minister of Economic Affairs , Eveline Lemke , is now out of politics and is still on the board of the wind turbine company Pro Wind .	-4.7771
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe - where , after four months of disagreement , she had already left the field .	-4.7675
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-2.8557
One day before Audi announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-3.0012
The chairman of the BMW Group said that the company considered that ' there are smarter options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel vehicles .	-5.6790
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles will be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-3.2204
None of the companies described the enterprise as a recall .	-3.0557
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-3.3004
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.3316
The cost to car manufacturers of installing systems for neutralising the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.8382
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-2.6159
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which was able to regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but to drive back in normal driving conditions .	-6.5647
In the United States , several employees of Volkswagen have been accused , while others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.5669
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi ’ s engine development in Germany .	-2.5032
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States .	-8.1974
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was extended .	-3.6303
Audi ’ s involvement in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury automobile manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profits .	-4.1737
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar .	-3.9580
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-2.2359
So that the visitors of the Isar can take part , a raft will run through Munich tomorrow Saturday , which has a special message .	-6.6395
When it comes to the Isar again on Saturday , you will see a big float between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-5.4788
And this is not a common raft , with Isar tourists .	-3.7404
In particular , the building department wants to enlighten .	-5.5970
On the raft you can see a large information transparency .	-4.0085
It shows a mountain of rubbish .	-1.7421
The start of a public relations campaign to appeal to Isar visitors .	-3.4661
The motto " True love is ... " is to sharpen our understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river .	-5.2354
As early as last summer , the raft crossed the Isar and this year , there are other actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious attitude .	-7.5845
Mordillo ’ s Crystal Places and Laughter Against Disease	-4.4290
Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoon artists , and his characters ' bones are his trademark .	-5.3614
Even with 85 , the Argentine still draws and works on a film .	-3.2271
His message : laughter , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-2.0868
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants .	-2.4642
In his early years as an artist , he worked as a drawing for greeting cards - which frustrated him .	-6.6490
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , " he once said .	-2.0696
After graduating in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the release of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.9356
Even in China Mordillo found many fans .	-1.5353
Time and again the artist was inspired by cities .	-3.3763
Large , round Mordillo figures appear in drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .	-4.0995
In the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting at the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.8409
Through calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , t-shirts , plushy toys and watches , his drunken figures continue to be widely spread worldwide .	-6.1463
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters .	-3.6137
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillo 's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand feet as an opponent .	-4.2547
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film , which is scheduled to appear on the cinema wall in 2019 .	-4.4572
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it 's strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.3055
The script is not written by him .	-1.6313
That 's why he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wordless .	-6.0453
Provence ’ s Lavender Threat to Climate Change	-2.0742
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.0098
Lavender is declining due to drought-related conditions and disease insects , causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.3764
Eric Chaisse , expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn .	-5.0709
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender .	-2.6152
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-3.3959
And the stakes are high .	-1.4362
Lavender soles attract not only tourists , but also perfumes and cosmetics .	-3.8825
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long ears of plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-3.6531
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.2792
The solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the ground , but also planting with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-4.5115
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year existence this year .	-3.2207
This Saturday and Sunday is the peak of a medieval festival .	-5.1184
Crams , guilds , merchants , vagabonds or a land trolleybus are to be seen in the city centre these days .	-8.2168
A journalist ’ s assassination highlights Mexico ’ s growing threat .	-2.3700
Riodoce weekly workers usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa by organized crime , corrupt officials , and relentless drug wars .	-4.2193
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.1037
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.7688
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children into office , which in 2009 was the target of a grenade attack , or leave them at home .	-4.9096
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.6461
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and belly feelings are sufficient .	-3.7886
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s payroll or the cartels , a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous .	-4.3527
There is no respite from violence , and while bodies are piling up across the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 ; 589 have been under federal protection following attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.5642
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration of Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-2.6950
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence .	-2.6655
Its absence is deeply felt , although its presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-5.2666
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .	-2.8601
Although a special Federal Prosecutor ’ s Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , the latter , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists , has initiated only two criminal proceedings .	-5.1258
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ’ killers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.9706
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating Sinaloa ’ s violence , even though they are inconsistent , and even though the terrain is now more treacherous .	-5.0093
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , says Ibarra .	-2.4612
" It 's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.7087
'Until we know why , we distrust everyone . '	-2.8080
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the provincial capital of Culiacan .	-2.8812
He only managed to travel a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced from his car and shot 12 times , probably because of the newspaper 's name - which is translated as " Twelve River " .	-5.4039
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.5997
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.8481
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.3939
Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan .	-1.8375
But on the subject of Valdez , there is virtually nothing but silence .	-3.1111
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlegrounds , as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum .	-2.8656
It does not matter that in Sinaloa , every day , one or more people are shot on the streets , or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings , which are larger than many houses for the living .	-5.1290
Forget for a minute that there is a state of calm when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-4.1535
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , was blamed for failing to protect his friend .	-3.6930
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder .	-1.5268
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.3301
This publication may have upset the sons , suspected gang members bought up each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-3.9402
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story .	-3.3826
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.0560
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.7857
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $ 50 holdings .	-4.4327
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.8525
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-3.5819
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to discuss .	-4.4574
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors Cabot Award " for her coverage in Latin America .	-7.6810
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led .	-3.3827
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.6255
" I want to live on , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.2689
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV .	-1.9594
" You have to do the job you do as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-7.2360
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-2.8576
The Riodoce team miss Valdez , the funny bird who could curse like a dock worker , the friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-3.8385
They relied on his routine .	-1.6693
He would always wear his hat .	-1.0842
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-2.2532
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his destruction ?	-2.6144
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive .	-3.4576
" You don 't like it when you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways " to move drugs .	-5.1678
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.8039
The result , even in the best of times , is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.1370
Trust your own instincts .	-1.0739
If it smells wrong , stay away .	-2.1996
The trouble is , the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said , ' smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier . '	-3.6111
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as they do in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials reside .	-3.4007
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.3018
In the space where Riodoce staff met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly not allowed , and it was announced days earlier that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.6240
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .	-2.7391
They were mandated by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan .	-3.8827
Halfway through the joke , some reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the policemen that the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-4.2455
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountains , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.2473
For this week 's edition , Riodoce has clicked on three main stories .	-4.0661
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.6354
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the governor ’ s hometown .	-3.0972
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block away from the prosecutor ’ s office .	-2.8021
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite of drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.1202
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .	-4.2266
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of high-profile corruption .	-2.3726
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this venue , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.7729
Only a few months earlier , readers would have regarded Valdez ’ s column as the most informed source of abduction .	-3.5144
" Previously , we would have known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body stature . .	-8.4222
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken up ' .	-2.5286
The Valdez office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against journalists ’ killings , because the staff have become something they would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-5.1784
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-3.7073
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.9717
A burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.1876
Throughout the country , journalists have become more vocal by writing " SOS Press " on the streets and buildings in organized protests .	-4.6152
On that day , director Bojorquez is away from Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-4.2515
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and murdering them for telling the truth .	-2.9085
Since then , she has asked for it to be reorganized by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-4.7950
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organized crime , government officials and an indifferent society .	-3.3048
In his last book , Narco-Journalism , he wrote that reporters are being killed not only by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces , who were under the cover of organized crime .	-5.1886
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials last year .	-3.8743
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut , " said Ramirez .	-3.0136
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.0903
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.3201
Their body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-3.3435
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separated head .	-3.1679
Some branches have chosen to close , such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-6.8054
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was murdered in 2004 .	-2.6932
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled ' What do you want from us ? '	-2.9966
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country .	-2.9187
It is a painful decision .	-0.7933
It is difficult to find work in exile and they are still watching the streets and looking for danger .	-3.0057
And sometimes they are hunted , as appears to the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 in a home in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz , along with four women .	-3.6516
For those who stay behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.6865
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking frightens him .	-2.1361
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a reporter , " he said .	-2.0382
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office on the pavement and drank beer when all their phones suddenly started to bump .	-5.2499
A number of shootings with band-rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan left 19 confirmed dead .	-4.1915
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel ambassadors in the region .	-2.7030
From the edge of the brook , they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone .	-5.7788
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.7517
Sirens hooked up nearby - another shooting facility in the area .	-5.5010
Bojorquez looked at the police who kept guard to see if they were ready .	-3.6244
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-2.5315
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa , the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps .	-4.8587
" How can you think of closing this , " said Bojorquez , " when on the same day that Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting . "	-5.9431
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade his enemies .	-2.4459
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.0005
Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as " the dinosaur 's Mona Lisa . " .	-9.4695
It was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said they had had something of a " restless past " .	-5.2558
The report in the magazine Current Biology called it " the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world " .	-3.2130
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurians who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.6932
Its incredibly well preserved state has startled researchers who describe it as ' truly remarkable ' .	-3.9039
According to reports in National Geographic , the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind .	-2.5731
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta , Canada .	-3.0288
He met something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-4.3052
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology .	-1.7292
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) of the earth ’ s shrimp .	-5.7405
After all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.2812
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost think it slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-4.4157
'It will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs . '	-3.1322
Researchers have found that , despite being covered with armor and resembling a changing tank , this herbivore was likely to be threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs .	-3.9383
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.8602
This would have made it possible to mix better with its surroundings and avoid its enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-5.1810
The 110-year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.3413
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it .	-3.3210
The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-4.1527
They discovered counterfeiting , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.6370
Although countershading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today .	-4.3241
It suggests that dinosaurs were hunted by sufficient pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs , that evolution favored veiling confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.8161
But most contemporary animals using countershading – think of roe , zebras , or belts – are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this nodosaur was facing a real struggle for survival .	-5.2152
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been during the Cretaceous Period , " Brown said .	-3.7196
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown .	-2.2521
Scientists continue to study the animal for information about its life , including its preserved intestinal content , to find out what it eaten as its last meal .	-4.2352
They believe that when he died , the dinosaur was flown into a river and driven out to the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .	-7.9332
At that time , Alberta was as warm as southern florida today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today .	-3.7678
" This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin , but it also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , " Brown said .	-5.6263
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it was in the early Crescent period .	-4.3681
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you just look a little with your eyes , you might almost think that he is sleeping . '	-5.8690
The Crescent era was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth .	-4.0806
Although the king of them , the tyrannosaurus Rex , lived for millions of years in Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors .	-3.0255
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .	-3.3067
Scientists whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology journal believe that Borealopelta was diluted in the sea after death and mummified in mud .	-3.8497
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub up on March 21 , 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta , Canada .	-2.8325
According to the museum , it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the muzzle to the hip .	-2.8946
Creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long on average , weighing up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.9577
It contained two 20-inch peaks that stood on its shoulders .	-4.0433
Researchers believe that the armored herbivore was flooded by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-3.2789
But the dinosaur ’ s underwater burial kept its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.8558
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur .	-4.6140
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as ' rare as a gain in the lottery .	-3.3339
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.6051
Aucted remains of the skin still cover the woody armour plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-5.5123
His right forehead is on his side , his five fingers are spun upwards .	-4.9920
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.7674
In Storm : Mass Carambolage on A8 : Many injured	-2.5079
Thousands of accidents on Thursday evening on the A8 : Less than 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-8.5357
There are many injured , kilometres of traffic jams and gadgets .	-4.6029
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) , around 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on Thursday afternoon .	-4.3265
According to the police , around 5 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) , almost 30 vehicles , probably including trucks , were interlocked during a thunderstorm .	-6.6277
The exact number of injuries was not reported at first .	-5.3746
It is light to medium injuries , said a police spokesman .	-4.3359
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site .	-3.8146
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .	-3.0110
In the direction of Munich , a ten-kilometre backlog was formed .	-5.3350
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive obstacles on the opposite track - due to a large number of visitors .	-7.8388
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle stewards , who now face severe penalties .	-5.9783
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.5284
This resulted in a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-3.7668
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .	-1.9106
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests ' Comfort Check-in '	-2.5786
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : you sit in the train and sleep with nothing in suspense .	-6.3404
Or you are deepened in his work and just have a brilliant idea .	-4.9240
And then : pufff .	-1.3390
Comes the creator and awakens a gently or tears the passenger out of the work.	-5.1791
Ticket control .	-1.8328
But the interruptions are soon over .	-2.8809
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the seamless ticket control .	-3.8239
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus devalue the ticket .	-5.2668
Currently , a test operation runs on two tracks .	-3.5335
" If the offer comes up , we extend it .	-4.5496
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany , " said a railway spokesman .	-4.5945
" Comfort Check-in " is the name given by the train to the depreciation of the ticket without the conductor .	-6.2215
However , in order to be able to use them , a number of conditions have to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-5.1957
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do .	-4.3074
You also have to buy it via the train App , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient way to book your ticket .	-5.4334
Last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-2.9811
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works like this : you get into the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.4189
A button for electronic validation will appear for test customers .	-4.3855
On their mobile devices , train attendants receive a notification that passengers X are on the train and have taken the booked seat Y .	-6.2293
When the train attendant arrives in place Y at ticket control , he knows that a passenger is there with an online ticket that has already been devalued .	-7.3532
So you can sleep , continue working , keep quiet .	-4.3969
Check-in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should benefit passengers .	-4.6179
" If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train attendants , just check in at the DB Navigator .	-6.0637
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time on the train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr .	-4.5242
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-4.5104
Those who often travel on the railways know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest annoyances . are .	-6.4005
Often , but in any case , one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets .	-7.5760
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or any other document you need to present .	-6.0305
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or in the large room and delays in controlling your own ticket , and ultimately takes the time for the creators to deal with other concerns .	-8.0314
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-2.3369
And this only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-2.3556
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet available .	-3.2818
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-1.9286
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-1.7510
Just one day after she arrived in New York City , she sat in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.7548
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school .	-2.4814
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street , " they said .	-3.5114
Confused because nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.1900
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline .	-3.1683
The rapper from the St. Louis area was tweeting the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mon .	-4.3459
He posted an image of Brown ’ s lifeless body , which was stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours .	-4.6647
" This is wild , " Ferrell thought .	-3.1038
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-2.1318
She dropped her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening .	-3.9386
There were photos of the police band and people shouting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who bore a sign saying : ' Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! '	-5.0558
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog .	-2.7169
In another video , she said , another policeman unleashed his rifle and shouted : ' I will kill you ... animals all ' .	-2.8680
" This is not customary , " Ferrell recalled her statement .	-2.7604
'This is not the kind of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call typical ' .	-3.2779
At that moment I felt chills .	-2.9055
I was angry and crying . '	-1.6032
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.6291
After landing at 11 p.m. , she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father 's house and decided that the next morning they would go to Ferguson .	-4.8126
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas since the 11th century .	-4.2321
It is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-3.5450
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , they discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state « .	-4.6294
" You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe in ? " she remembered what she said .	-3.2068
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-2.5273
I could not take her with me , " Ferrell said later .	-2.2448
" What happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .	-2.7870
She must know and see it and be raised in it .	-3.0686
It must be well developed , know not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to be free , to free ourselves .	-8.5941
Although I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black woman child .	-4.7469
I feel I would be doing her a disservice to keep her away from it . '	-3.6554
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.8909
There , Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who had lunch .	-4.3864
They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-5.5037
Slowly , a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape .	-2.5216
" My activism changed completely after 9 August , " she said , and notes that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association , focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.1964
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.7354
Everything has come . '	-1.7761
Weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-1.7910
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.0442
One question was put to Ferrell : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-3.6767
This skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people , often whites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.2586
As Folayan recently stated in an interview , ' We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centrate their voices and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-3.8988
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates .	-4.0225
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , together with six other locals , followed the Whose Streets team in the years following Brown ’ s shooting .	-11.4839
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us , " DaviDavi.	-4.0958
'That was the main thing for me how these people are presented , because that is how I will be presented ' .	-4.7467
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a messiah leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.1350
As a result , documents from Whose Streets show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-3.6899
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-2.7566
" But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people . "	-4.2426
Moreover , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement .	-2.6657
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , coined the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-2.9441
" Black , gay women in managerial positions have carried the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-4.7288
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.1668
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.7179
She insists , however , that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity .	-3.3475
" She was the person who stirred up this energy , " she said .	-2.7736
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because there is so much at stake in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman .	-4.4191
You can feel your energy through the screen . '	-2.1080
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police persist .	-3.4223
Ferrell is suspended for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-2.7467
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-3.4244
However , she clings to a song and feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-5.1136
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.0565
It is our duty to win .	-0.9523
We must love and support each other .	-1.1422
We have nothing to lose except our chains . '	-1.9314
From Dream to Size : TV readers discuss Bit Gallery .	-2.9472
The Bit Gallery moves people even though it is far from being built .	-3.1585
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-3.7761
There is hardly one cold issue .	-4.5433
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.4290
While some say to the Bit Gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really great " ( Nicole Schausten ) , from the other side comes : " Needs no man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply " megalomania " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-4.8620
While supporters rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , benefiting the rest of the shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bloom .	-11.2804
In addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the site where the farm market hall is located , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-5.3386
This will be the end of the construction process .	-4.4074
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside .	-4.1375
Simone Zimmer : " We have been buying in the farmhouse market hall almost weekly for many years .	-4.6242
Our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women , are always very welcome .	-6.0662
We also discovered the butcher 's shop for us .	-3.4376
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the gallery has been built .	-4.8077
Other cities also have this .	-3.4562
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . '	-3.0999
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent .	-3.2156
However , I do not think this will be very low in the new project . '	-5.3741
Eva Kilic : " What shopping malls in Bitburg ?	-1.9978
Whether it is clothing , shoes , drugstores or supermarkets , I find that superfluous .	-5.0580
There are already enough of this in our city .	-4.9315
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.4265
However , since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall .	-4.5409
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive .	-4.8646
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies , because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer .	-5.8777
It is a pity that there are almost no more special shops and that what remains of them will probably disappear . '	-6.6408
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not suit me .	-2.6840
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.7457
Above all : Where should the farm-market hall be located during the construction period ?	-4.8217
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .	-3.7935
Or is the Ghost Bit Gallery already managing to sell all shops from Bitburg ? "	-3.9426
George Marquet : ' That will simply not work .	-2.5198
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-2.4252
In my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .	-3.5207
But there is no room for a farmer 's market hall , thanks to the madness of many - I think - useless construction projects in Bitburg .	-6.5493
If the farm market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-6.5565
An Appropriate Similarity : Artist Creates Portraits with Chelsea Manning ’ s DNA	-7.1524
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , almost imperceptibly the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-4.7500
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from chelsea slippers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning . , and . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.6969
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publishing classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website .	-4.4696
The new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Becoming Resemblance .	-2.5943
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline combined their expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and Manning , a transwoman and pioneering dissident , whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he had only three days left .	-4.2462
Dewey-Hagborg , through algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning , from which 30 portraits of how someone might look with these genomic data , has created a sharp , if somewhat intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.5450
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the espionage law , computer fraud , and theft .	-4.4644
Her image was suppressed by the prison , so much so that there was only one photo - a grained , black and white Selfie , in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver 's seat and wearing a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated .	-10.2549
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2010 project Stranger Visions .	-3.1760
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts , such as cigarette dumb and chewing gum , extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of what those people might look like .	-5.0239
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.7081
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-2.9368
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-4.7844
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal correspondents who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-3.5755
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person .	-3.2167
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-4.2747
There is still some depth and strength at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new , tweet-capable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to address .	-6.0933
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a given reason " .	-2.7810
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning , with her oversized signature ( the " i " in her family name is embroidered with a heart ) , called for an end to " automatic fragmentation based on gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-4.8961
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-3.2433
Dewey-Hagborg hoped by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the artist ’ s highly developed scientific lexicon ) to show how surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-4.0341
" What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose 2007 video work , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-3.9930
'DNA data can tell so many different stories , so there are 30 of these stories . '	-3.1730
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the aforementioned comic novella .	-4.1623
She shows Manning how she appears like King song with a hands-on phone from the disciplines of the United States .	-5.2029
" When they cold your speech , they won , " it says .	-4.1020
'Never stop talking ' .	-2.9368
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets from Philadelphia .	-3.0428
'I still get goose butter when I talk about it ' .	-3.2502
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as predictably anticipated in the comic book - but if it should , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , by its own genomic simulacres , which collide like hordes of protesters .	-6.0144
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Manning 's stature ) , in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-4.7954
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.4319
'I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . '	-3.6928
Professor of Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee looking for killing .	-3.3970
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are being sought as suspects after a man was stolen in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with lethal injuries .	-5.1098
On Monday , arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) for murders for alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as evidenced by the acts of the Court of Cook County .	-3.9046
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-2.0804
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Agency states that the body was discovered on July 27 .	-3.8578
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.0916
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene , and detectives investigate the stitches as murder , while the police actively search for the two suspects , officials said .	-4.5993
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.0611
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice President of University Relations , said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been certified and has been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University .	-4.6418
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.4122
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.1874
A university spokesman and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that ' we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in every way possible ' .	-5.1177
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to face .	-3.4872
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he is urging suspects to face up to the authorities .	-3.8465
" The police have an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them are intensifying , " said Guglielmi .	-2.9707
Guglielmi said that local , regional , and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-6.6426
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building , who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something had happened in the apartment 1008 .	-4.4163
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.2030
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.7350
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.0395
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " Guglielmi said .	-1.7065
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to the residents : ' The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . '	-4.4594
'We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future ' - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko	-2.6295
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for restoring Russia ’ s anti-doping agency ( RUSADA ) are implemented .	-3.2413
" At a certain stage of meeting the roadmap criteria , RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.0089
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.2346
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for reintroducing RUSADA and recently published on the organization 's website .	-4.3728
According to Mutko , there is nothing that could give Russia cause for concern .	-2.4475
" Everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .	-2.5518
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.7658
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-3.7625
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : ' We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted an error .	-3.9002
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.3314
But there were no government programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-3.2283
Mutko ’ s words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of Russia ’ s independent anti-doping commission .	-2.1733
When talking to the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-9.9764
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally , " added Smirnov .	-2.1986
In November 2015 , following the doping scandal , RUSADA was excluded from conducting doping controls in Russia .	-3.1351
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.1981
Following a visit by the organization 's headquarters in Moscow in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is " moving in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-4.3421
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being	-2.3812
That was shared by the business groups .	-2.8572
It is a purely precautionary measure , as the communication says , that no further damage to health can be assumed .	-6.6602
From now on only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fipronile-containing anti-Läusemittel .	-6.4859
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers .	-3.7355

Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your employees in your e-commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .	-3.4389
Answers were often vague , unhelpful , or , worse , fraudulent .	-1.9411
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.6787
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who operates the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-2.4131
She has called people from outside for help .	-2.2523
A new race of Human Resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.1189
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , provide anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees , and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-Suite executives and directly address the board of directors .	-5.0926
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analysis tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .	-3.1802
Errett said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-2.4185
In addition to snap surveys and surveys by certain teams , it offers a company heat card that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill why .	-5.3579
Companies are coming to see that they must stay at the top of the workplace culture , so that you do not become the next man involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished .	-5.5275
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.4341
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could be worth more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial website Let 's Talk Payments .	-3.4203
Denver , Colorado , start-up Convercent , which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw a rising interest and activity early this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit .	-3.4889
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.4932
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-1.8202
Like Glint , Convercent lets companies send customised " pulse " surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-4.3347
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.0189
And if the Chief Executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.2391
" The court of public opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , founder and CEO of Convercent .	-2.6116
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotts , employee turnover and complaints , Quinlan said .	-4.4693
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .	-4.4323
In the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email to the headquarters , file a formal complaint , and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.6028
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff .	-3.0113
Now that the company employs Convercent , problems previously hidden by leaders who sat in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , harassment , or unfair practices , can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-5.3073
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.9623
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes ' .	-2.9281
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.8815
But it took the Social Media to get their act together , and companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online .	-5.7816
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.3924
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-3.4410
It is a business model and an opportunity that meets the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups .	-3.9962
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .	-3.2407
Glitzers secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised total funding to $ 60 million .	-2.7620
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.7268
There is a growing set of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-4.8868
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-2.0447
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.7808
" If people are happy to be in a company that listens to their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , who uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.2021
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well .	-4.4467
If third party analytics tools promise to increase employee involvement and commitment , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.9729
The data on employee involvement according to the experts of the workplace culture important .	-9.1292
But the data are useless if a company ’ s managers do not take action .	-2.9779
Indeed , if a company asks employees for your feedback , they can expect change to be on the way .	-4.2242
And if change is not rapid enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and discourage employees .	-4.0828
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at Kotter International Business Management Company , which has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data .	-4.6184
" Because if you do not follow staff will ask , " Did you really hear me ?	-3.5459
Are you concerned about this ?	-2.0028
And who you do not care about it , why should I ? '	-3.4006
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , according to Errett .	-3.8346
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , thanks to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-4.7374
At Ruby Tuesday , the company keeps getting new insights into its employees , and hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better retention of employees in an industry known for high sales .	-6.2625
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.7993
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.5943
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-6.7602
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins	-2.9583
It goes to 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team 's new practice fields on the campus .	-5.8659
Some have removed their tricot parts and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.9320
For a large part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .	-3.2910
Players enrolled in summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6 : 30 the next morning .	-4.6519
" This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , " said Bruins trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.7980
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-3.7204
For this reason , the UCLA ’ s first three training sessions should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the players ’ busy schedule .	-6.1607
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , and practiced during the summer school for the first time during Mora ’ s six seasons in Westwood .	-4.9450
They are expected to hold 18 exercises during August , 20 before the formal game preparations begin for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-5.8478
Mora said that he supported the NCAA ’ s rule change , even if they added another point to the players ’ busy routes .	-5.0935
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.6747
" And they just pushed it through , they continue to placate , they are great people .	-5.0378
I think that once we get to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-4.0080
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear lines of its fields , from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the upper class that has already been fired with footballs clearing a safety net behind a gate post .	-11.8614
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are vacant during the season .	-3.8110
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.7336
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to record an exercise .	-3.7603
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is quite a good business .	-7.9722
But we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8 .	-2.5535
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.5937
I am therefore not too concerned .	-2.7491
We have a plan . '	-0.9726
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking efforts to combat counterfeit news .	-3.2793
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to fact-checking auditors from third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday .	-6.1788
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin to use updated machine learning methods to detect possible falsehoods and send them to fact-inspectors who may display the results of the fact-checking from the original article .	-6.1232
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distributions for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-3.7600
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled postings , as they did before the September elections .	-4.6759
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands , and Germany .	-4.0330
" In addition to recognizing which stories are challenged by third-party fact-checking experts , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-4.5017
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the " related article " and work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages .	-3.8480
Creating a Comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.9504
In his recent past , Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-4.0194
But Scotney has lived through 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy home in the Bewl River Valley in Kent , and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaaric Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents .	-4.8592
" I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he sadly says .	-4.1056
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands . '	-2.5405
A Castle in England spans the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney .	-4.4477
It is not Rhodes ' first book based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional .	-2.8401
" I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 's who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-4.4256
" This is his thumbprint !	-2.0551
And letters always smell of smoke , because at that time a fire was lit because of light .	-3.7773
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there .	-4.1250
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.2217
For someone who is so old that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( " To be honest , I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting " ) , all this seems too good to be true .	-6.3157
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , browsing the archives and studying the castle 's many treasures and curiosities , such as the mounted hyan heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries digging .	-5.0260
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape lovers , gardeners and sometimes artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-4.9975
Then , at night he drank " whiskey and began to write " .	-1.7816
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown , because the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.1879
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees began to look at the archive he described as " hundreds of years when aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the roof . "	-5.1168
Diaries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps showing who possessed what : " You could think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to which two families fought .	-4.9495
Young , let everything go ! '	-3.2301
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for a wider immersion into English history , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381 .	-4.5338
" There is a record of a riot that appeared in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.0216
" The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-2.8306
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-2.3622
Other stories are deeply rooted in the castle 's history , such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit patron , whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.0077
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which depicts the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-3.4071
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks , borrowing time and money for things they could not afford .	-4.6136
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to promote grandchildren . "	-4.0822
After the end of his visit to the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-4.9753
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki , the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature .	-4.4673
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.7007
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.4788
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to deal with the condemned life again ' .	-4.2813
Campaign Launched : More than 300 Years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf Shattered	-4.7237
With the covering of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand on Friday .	-3.9841
Until Thursday , mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.5497
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-3.9930
" Too nice for us .	-1.4587
Or ? " , the promoters have been asking on posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel since yesterday .	-4.9168
" We don 't really think this ( of course ! ) , " they write on their website , which was yesterday .	-4.5098
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.8015
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem .	-2.3066
Basically , we firmly believe that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know full well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.3032
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-3.5737
" It is necessary to make a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistakable unique feature " .	-5.1500
After all , it is in competition with other communities .	-5.4463
The city of Bad Honnef can cost an average five-digit amount of its new roof brand and campaign .	-5.3121
Turkey 's Military Reform - Erdogan 's Army Fear	-1.7486
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and promotion in the officer corps .	-4.1984
This week too .	-2.2263
At first glance , a normal process .	-5.5551
But nothing is routine among the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.8282
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff 's building , as it used to be , but in the Prime Minister 's office .	-4.4855
The five Vice-Premier and Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government .	-5.2093
As a result , the civilian population in the YAS was in excess .	-5.7216
The government is tightening up the military .	-3.1485
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the commanders of the army , the air force and the navy have been removed .	-4.2026
Since the failed coup , Prime Minister Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.1699
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army , mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen , whom Erdogan views as the leader of the coup attempt .	-5.0743
There have been negotiations in Ankara since this week against 486 people who are alleged to have been directly involved in the coup attempt .	-4.2939
Even the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the coup attempt a “ gift of God , ” because he gave him the opportunity to “ clean up ” the armed forces completely .	-5.2912
But is Erdogan really in control of the army ?	-2.1648
At the end of February , the newspaper Hürriyet published an article entitled ' Unease in the Military Headquarters ' .	-2.7644
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing " Islamicisation " of the army , manifested among other things in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-6.0322
In any case , the big cleaning up of the army and the security forces continues .	-5.1179
In mid-July , Erdogan ordered a further 7395 civil servants to fire , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-2.9874
Erdogan seemed to have tamed the military .	-2.4054
The generals were once considered to be the real masters of the country .	-3.7095
Three times they cleansed , citing their role as guardians of the secular state order .	-5.0967
After winning in 2002 , Erdogan gradually pushed back the military ’ s power , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reform agenda .	-4.8760
Former officers say that Erdogan is purposefully pushing forward Islamization of the armed forces .	-3.3747
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a non-named officer , who sought asylum abroad following the attempted coup for fear of persecution , warned that in a few years ' time the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and salafists . "	-5.1878
If so , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-2.5794
In any case , after the purges , there are doubts in the alliance about the Turkish army ’ s readiness to intervene .	-4.8270
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are " weakened , " says NATO diplomats .	-3.1333
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules	-1.2500
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-1.8080
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas .	-8.8647
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.4863
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .	-3.4238
'This law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which green cards are issued to citizens from other countries . '	-3.5639
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.3505
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-4.1689
Ministry of Renewal Track for Racetrack Huts	-5.5626
Over the past few months we have been arguing about the future of the racetrack hut - now it 's time to go fast .	-8.1055
Before the end of the year , construction is to be carried out on the crumbling route on which the tourist train runs .	-6.8190
In order to secure the future of the racetrack hut in the long term , construction work on the track should start this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .	-5.3258
" With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country is committed to this link , which is particularly important for tourism , " said Klaus Sühl , transport secretary , on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.3993
He put the cost of repairing the route at around EUR 2.5 million .	-3.6678
The country takes over 75 % of this sum .	-3.7337
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country , is currently being finalised , declared Sühl .	-5.5983
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operators already agreed on the technical details .	-3.1808
" The roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , " said Sühl .	-3.9933
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for eleven years .	-2.9308
The race shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 .	-4.6456
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular train service between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations , especially for tourists .	-4.0410
Over the past few months , a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by a sufficient number of people to order it regularly in the future .	-6.2880
In addition , parts of the route are heavily demolition .	-5.9624
The rise of sex robots is real , and let us worry .	-2.1587
Just when you thought that it could not be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report comes out on technological developments in the field of sex robrobots .	-5.3183
Yes , indeed .	-1.1658
Sex-robots are a big thing at the moment .	-2.1577
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-1.9135
According to Noel Sharkey , an emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-2.9771
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail .	-4.0060
" People make fun of them , but companies make up a lot of them and we will see them even more frequently , " said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-5.1506
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-4.7652
The user can also " adjust " his robot according to his beliefs , choosing everything from the robot 's eye color , the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails .	-5.3296
But it becomes even more worrying , because many robots have the " personalities " that would make a Stepford woman look progressive .	-4.0169
Modern sex puppets have developed into robots with a silicone skin .	-5.8421
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as shyness .	-4.3999
And then there are the Roxxxxy Gold sex robots , developed by True Companion , with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which give the impression of timidity and " Wild Wendy " with an " adventurous " personality .	-4.4932
" Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible " , swarms the True Companion website .	-4.8864
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc .	-2.3761
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people !	-3.6040
She may be tired , tied to conversation , or ' in mood ' !	-4.2691
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics , the allusions to rape when one takes a step toward Frigid ( here : reluctant ) Farrah , worry one the most .	-6.3902
On his website , True Companion compared Roxxxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.7102
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have a Roxxxxy ? " says the website .	-3.9928
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-2.9054
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-3.5492
Of course , most men will not hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity , they remain on the margins of consumer culture for now .	-7.1926
But what leaks out of the periphery can be very instructive in the spirit of the time we live in .	-4.4992
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market allows them to do so .	-2.5141
There is a certain overlap between these highly developed sex robots appearing at a time when the rights of women worldwide are under threat , when there is a President in the White House who has irradiated by having sexually assaulted women .	-5.3729
The most deterrent aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the twisted bodies and the exposed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-4.8967
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-3.0061
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with pornostar proportions ) .	-4.0189
Their builders want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-3.0049
But , to sum up , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , robots are not real women .	-3.4131
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply walk away .	-4.0363
They have no mediation or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission .	-4.1095
In other words , they are pleasing slaves .	-2.3253
Or , to put it in the 2017 dictum , maids .	-5.1132
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-0.8292
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense .	-1.5666
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small format .	-3.0835
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival , newspapers in the US gave advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s elected relatives .	-3.7026
We are all supposedly trying to burst our filter bubbles .	-3.8708
Less noted has Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-1.9285
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me in New York this week .	-3.3989
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-2.2261
With Trump in the White House , anyone she knows , including the Republican kinship with which she fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and strangely on the same side .	-4.0075
That is certainly a good thing about the table , but it strikes me in another context that there are also significant risks involved .	-5.5660
Trump has strengthened the left , but his presidency ’ s disfiguring effect has the strength to push us all to the right .	-3.7542
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the dreadful possibility that one day his patrons will no longer throw us off .	-5.2821
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “ normalizes ” right-wing Republicans , who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reason relative to his standards .	-4.4239
I now find myself struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s funny version of the madman – the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax return looked like ) – both of whom , in fact , look very mild compared to Trump .	-6.2575
When Trump goes , the Republicans ’ next candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.4573
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest carousel in the New York Park Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don 't need caffeine .	-5.1825
The horses are huge , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crazy and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climatic music conveys this in a strange way .	-6.7572
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-3.9750
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a major roundabout in northern London .	-3.7159
The Central Park carousel , however , is still a strange magical experience , as two two-year olds , one 11-year olds and two women can go there in the 40 ’ s and all have a great time .	-6.1612
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked .	-7.6688
On the other hand , this week in a department store , I was forced to evaluate my " experience " of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-4.1772
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to match the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .	-4.1424
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is needed .	-4.0757
The poor woman in the department store was apologetic grinning , while I tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card .	-5.0857
Oscar Pistorius moved breast pain from prison to hospital .	-2.8620
Pistorius left the hospital for the second time .	-2.5239
Last year , he was taken to hospital for treating cuts to his wrists , which he suffered following a case in his cell , according to the prison authorities .	-4.8541
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence .	-3.4115
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine ’ s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his Pretoria house .	-4.1219
Pistorius claimed that he regarded his girlfriend as a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin .	-3.5017
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius , who they say is too lenient .	-4.0137
The National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to the South African Supreme Court , and the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.7758
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if prosecutors succeed .	-3.2218
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-1.0718
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg .	-2.7681
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the fourteenth students were dismissed from Fützen and Epfenhofen for holidays and secondary schools .	-5.2726
Three of the dismissed students will go to secondary school in future , four to primary school .	-6.6325
School leader Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public to the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-3.7834
As a symbol of the dismissal , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and director Meder , chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken house but is then released .	-5.0603
In addition , the lively crowd performed a musical entitled " Der Adler im Hühnerhof " .	-7.8740
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to erupt from his chickens .	-3.4951
Instead of a chicken baking , a small eagle came out .	-3.5342
But the hope of making him a chicken broke , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and vanished .	-4.6724
After that , the classes three and four showed a chicken dancing in Yvonne Frank ’ s study .	-5.1851
The hens danced with the young goggles who wore cylinders to the bet .	-7.5767
The eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-2.6019
The puppy is different from the other puppy ( chicks ) but belongs to it .	-6.5701
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.5808
His determination was to be free .	-2.6421
She wanted every fourth student to feel accepted in his new school .	-5.0486
My thanks to my colleagues , former head of school , Michael Müller , who keeps jumping in at school bottlenecks , and to the parents .	-6.7485
The chicken age is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-2.6323
They are very reluctant to release their students after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .	-4.9475
In the end , she was able to rely on the quartet .	-4.7997
At the end of the course , all the students performed a song of summertime and holiday time .	-8.1145
The children were very happy .	-4.7427
Eight first-class applicants have already been registered for the new school year .	-3.3945
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.5568
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .	-3.8172
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally detaining people , including the two Bulgarians , was arrested by the police in Sithonia .	-3.2444
On the same day , they were released while an investigation is under way .	-2.6138
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later .	-2.3449
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose significant fines on anyone found to be in a place not intended for that purpose .	-4.9907
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.3622
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-2.3785
Software update for diesel vehicles : What those affected now need to know .	-3.2328
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.9347
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?	-3.2840
The most important questions and answers in an overview .	-2.3171
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.8404
They are intended to improve exhaust behaviour for cars in emission categories Euro 5 and , in part , Euro 6 .	-4.8327
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-2.3890
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europa estimates :	-1.9764
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.2421
No , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .	-1.5572
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have dumb software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-4.0511
The German Federal Motor Agency ( KBA ) has ordered their retrofitting .	-4.4121
How and from when are customers informed of updates ?	-2.4603
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet set a precise date .	-4.3430
Daimler has announced that it will notify any person concerned .	-5.0297
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework .	-4.5607
How long will the overall changeover take ?	-3.5080
" Hard to say , " says Smetanin .	-1.6173
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure .	-3.0995
'Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment ' .	-4.6547
How long should the update take ?	-1.4058
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.7031
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment .	-2.7754
What are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-5.8804
The ACE advises you to wait .	-2.3381
According to Smetanin , foreign producers would probably follow suit .	-3.1697
Is there a risk of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars ?	-3.6648
The ACE fears that .	-2.4156
However , it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatened .	-3.5985
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.3624
ACE advises you to wait with a sale .	-3.3612
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award .	-2.1459
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.1046
The first award under President Trump promises to become political .	-3.1918
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .	-2.1757
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious awards of the Kennedy Center .	-2.5213
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday , this year also saw singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) , choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) .	-4.0211
The awards will be handed out at the beginning of December .	-2.4830
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania .	-3.4701
The award winner Lear , known for his progressive TV series , had already announced that he would not participate in the gala .	-6.9550
He said to the New York Times : ' This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the resources - and this is a burden on me ' .	-5.6491
59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear . , , the . , , the , and the .	-9.9959
The Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.1151
Former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.6028
Making the City Livable	-1.8884
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city builder , retires next year .	-2.5182
The job is already advertised - however , suitable applicants are rare .	-4.4463
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years .	-2.4265
And the work still gives him great fun , as he conveys in the press interview .	-4.7859
He reports on varied but challenging tasks awaiting his successor .	-4.5349
At the same time , he is surprised that no application fulfils the requirement profile .	-4.2960
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the earliest possible time .	-3.5902
This means that there is still enough time to get involved , taking into account the regular notice periods .	-7.4664
Since Haslach functions as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community , the Applicant must have the necessary qualifications .	-5.8017
Because the city wants to retain this function .	-4.4861
If they were no longer able to fill them in , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-6.7298
But proximity to the city and to the city itself is important , says Wacker , who reports a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and the citizens .	-6.2078
In more than 30 years in office , a number of important projects have accumulated , to which Wacker is proud .	-5.6162
" We make the city worth living " , he is assured by the construction office and his employees .	-4.8482
In the future , however , diverse projects will also be on the agenda : the reconstruction of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for example , are underway .	-6.2985
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic .	-4.8072
The latter alone will hit at around EUR 1.5 million , " if we get it right , " Wacker estimates .	-4.5581
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.2417
The work here is fun . '	-2.1999
There was a lot of room for a city builder in design .	-6.7018
With Haslach ’ s own farm and gardening , many things can be reacted quite flexibly .	-4.9168
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-4.8039
Since the Old Town is listed as an ensemble , it is important to " have an eye for what fits in " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing City Architect stresses .	-6.4704
In any case , the mayor of the city has a high responsibility .	-4.6468
He is a builder , " at the end everything runs over my table " .	-4.3680
He can count on longstanding employees in support and coordination : Markus Neumaier ( building ) has been involved for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( civil engineering ) has been involved for 15 years .	-6.9353
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the job and stay with it " .	-5.5487
Continuity is important not only for a good business climate , but also for the further development of the city .	-3.7030
If you would like to inherit Roland Wacker , the city of Haslach would like to have completed your studies as a diploma engineer or Bachelor of Architecture and have a good knowledge of construction planning and construction law .	-8.3295
The City Building Office is responsible for building and civil engineering , construction planning , land acquisition matters , administration of urban properties , Municipal farm with building yard and city gardening , as well as the suburb building law authority including protection of monuments .	-11.4298
Wheel thrown on lines : South railway closed .	-5.4644
According to the police , the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the area of Leobener Straße ( B116 ) onto the lines .	-4.2694
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-3.3578
The investigators start from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-4.1860
A rosarote scooter and a bicycle rider had been observed near the scene .	-5.3314
" This goes far beyond a whirlwind , " said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch , head of the APA .	-4.9618
The perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and would also have put rail transport at risk .	-4.7034
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and plant , as well as the minutes of delay and the cost of rail replacement , the perpetrators could also be the patrons of rail customers .	-6.7715
All in all , the speaker said that a " significant " sum should be assumed .	-6.0229
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon , and rail transport on the southern railway line could be carried out without any obstacles .	-8.7796
Almost ten passenger trains had disappeared on Friday morning , two of which were long-distance traffic .	-5.0378
Freight trains did not fail , but they were delayed .	-3.9374
According to ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch , overhead lines had to be exchanged for about 200 metres .	-4.1711
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.4985
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help to relieve IBD ( inflammatory bowel disease ) .	-2.8601
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.4230
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease .	-3.6113
The incurable state , which affects about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach swamps and blisters , recurrent or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-5.0051
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-4.3548
The senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body .	-4.1596
Cells capable of inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .	-3.3123
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , inflammatory intestinal disease may result .	-4.2228
Experiments have found that some kind of toleration-promoting immunodeficiency occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their originals .	-6.1306
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger cell appearance .	-3.5135
Professor Colonna said : ' We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-8.4210
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells " .	-2.3976
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant , less inflammatory intestines , if the same system also works in humans .	-4.1864
The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of mammals had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was housed separately , did not .	-5.1413
She suspected that the difference had to do with mice ’ s intestinal problems – the community of bacteria , viruses , and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.0684
The mice ’ s dams were sequenced to DNA , and six types of bacteria were found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them the mice lacked .	-5.1899
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so they lacked an intestinal robiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-6.5628
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers L. reuteri grew in a fluid and then transferred small quantities of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature cells isolated from the mice .	-5.2942
The immune cells became the tolerant cells .	-3.4266
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol 3 milk acid .	-4.0826
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice ’ s feed , the number of such cells rose by about 50 % , but when tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.5788
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-2.3574
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as they do in mice , but deficiencies in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease .	-5.2718
She said : ' The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the intestinal surface .	-3.6517
Possibly high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . "	-4.3525
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a genius with Nemanja Matic .	-2.5809
Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , believing Jose Mourinho after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-4.2307
The £ 40 million signature by Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the role of holder when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will .	-5.0540
Matic , however , had been excluded from the Blues ’ Preparatory Asian tour and only managed 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .	-5.4055
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.8105
'We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later . '	-2.3092
Besides Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season .	-4.8058
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a ' fantastic job ' to meet three of its four priority new commitments .	-4.2436
" To get three out of four , for which I thank the association , " he added .	-3.0290
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken a lot of trouble . '	-3.7939
Boeing " Malt " Dreamliner in Heaven	-2.4628
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky .	-2.7919
The pilots departed from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan and took the form of a Dreamliner over the USA , which is several thousand kilometers .	-5.6928
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.4353
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner .	-2.9828
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .	-2.9391
Boeing had already made such advertising before .	-3.3476
The number " 787 " and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky .	-2.8293
New setback for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem .	-3.0359
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-4.8178
Just not a flare from the party headquarters , just no headwinds from the federal government - that was the main wish of the campaigners .	-7.9493
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.5840
Since then , Willy-Brandt staff have watched events in SPD-governed capitals with growing horror .	-5.1297
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds .	-3.0430
They were setbacks .	-2.8116
One by one .	-1.4855
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Greens .	-4.5890
" This shows once again : Red Green simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-4.0382
The surprising departure of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a serious crisis .	-7.8457
Five months before the general election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-4.1294
The Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kellner has asked the breakaway Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate .	-5.6818
Transitioning to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate ’ s will .	-4.1681
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and campaign manager of the Greens to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-4.4763
" This must not be true , " a SPD campaigner sighs when the new hio message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-6.8056
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands without a government majority after the Green deputy Elke Twesten surrendered to the CDU .	-5.3864
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national federations .	-4.0500
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.8190
The plight began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-2.8851
A blue eye , no more , the comrades reassured themselves at the time .	-3.5797
After the regional elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.4835
That became the case - and things got much worse .	-5.6735
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to a halt , and the Düsseldorf bust flattened the party .	-5.9053
The comrades were slow to pick up again in the weeks after .	-5.4602
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg came .	-4.4791
And with him came the next blow .	-2.7632
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nickname that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-3.5267
And because , in crisis communication , he subsequently made pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong .	-4.9399
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-1.8031
Now also Stephan Weil .	-2.4466
Due to the VW exhaust emissions affair and its role on the supervisory board of the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , criticism has been going on for some time .	-5.2485
Miese survey values were added .	-3.2595
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Weil has been trying to place emphasis on the federal government in recent weeks .	-6.7561
The effort of the former mayor of Hannover to increase his power in Berlin was not concealed by comrades around Martin Schulz .	-4.3681
They allowed him to be granted because they promised Weil to stabilize the party .	-3.6974
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.5467
Because , in fact , there is no blame for the partisan dispute between the Greens from Lower Saxony .	-6.4104
And Schulz certainly does not .	-2.4098
For the time being , therefore , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.4151
Your anger is directed at the Greens , and especially at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten .	-4.1519
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Mrs Twesten puts her own careers above the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , leader of the party left in the SPD Bundestag Group , the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-5.3764
Mrs Twsten has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but has been elected to parliament via the national list of the Greens from Lower Saxony , according to the Member from Lower Saxony .	-6.5729
The logical consequence would be for it to return its mandate .	-2.3379
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestag Group , laments an " undemocratic manoeuvre . "	-3.4178
" Four years ago , the will of voters was clear : the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the federal election , the RND .	-5.2971
" Now the personal career memory of a future CDU deputy falsifies the election result , " Oppermann continued .	-4.0676
He asked for the background to be clarified .	-2.6239
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-3.6986
Funding for Locality III	-4.0682
If you want to renovate your old house , you can get help from the country in the near future .	-5.4502
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen .	-4.4012
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what happened so far .	-4.0953
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen .	-4.4297
At that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding .	-4.6935
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsidy was still 60 % .	-4.0947
For Schindler , the refurbishment to date is a " success project " - it is important to promote internal development as well , and not just to open up new construction areas .	-6.5928
On 4 April , the Karlsruhe Government Bureau informed that there would be a rehabilitation area III .	-5.3666
The amount of funding was EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country and the rest from the municipality of Empfingen .	-4.2950
How does a rehabilitation area come into being ?	-3.3769
They will , according to Schindler , investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-4.4470
However , there is also a role to be played by whether there is any interest in the planned area to be remedied .	-5.9030
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be shifted again .	-4.1932
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-1.5600
Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme " Social City " , within the framework of which the rehabilitation would then be carried out .	-4.6823
The programme focuses on the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-4.9268
The measures would be carried out objectively , that is to say , per piece of land .	-4.7886
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute .	-3.9347
Since 1 January 2017 , the eligibility period for the funds has run until 30 April 2026 .	-4.7179
However , by September this year , the inventory would first be carried out , in which those involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire for completion .	-7.0662
In November or December , as far as possible , the decision on the statute is to be taken so that the rehabilitation can begin next year .	-6.3424
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .	-4.3903
It is a question of assessing urban problems and deciding when to redevelop and to what extent .	-5.0443
There will also be a change in the land registry for the land .	-10.5915
Pietzschmann himself would come to reception again and get a picture of the situation , she promised .	-4.6980
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .	-4.3696
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays .	-4.7189
The yellow questionnaire is the " Arc of Buildings and Plots " , which deals , among other things , with the building condition and the restoration plans .	-6.9189
In the grey questionnaire , the " Household and Household Arc " , information about the size , distribution and inhabitants of a residential area can be provided .	-5.5539
The blue " sheet " can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building .	-5.1260
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding . , , , , , , . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.1763
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .	-3.9374
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the " greyhound principle " - who arrives first , grills first .	-5.7107
It is not possible to ' reserve ' funding for later .	-3.9907
Finally , photos of the project " Ortskern II " have been shown to make a restoration " tasteful " for those present .	-6.5259
British inventor is setting up a microchip to get into the house and into the car with a hand . is .	-9.1816
A British inventor is the first in the country to have a microchip so that he can open his door , enter his office , and even start his car by hand .	-4.2707
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between fingers and fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq .	-3.8966
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultant anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards .	-3.7482
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-2.5535
Mr Northam ’ s firm also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip , all for an extra £ 300 per lock .	-5.2824
The married father of one has now built in both his home and his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .	-4.0635
The White House ’ s Advertising Cost to the taxpayer Thous	-2.9926
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that emphasizes American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military ’ s data given to TIME magazine .	-4.6397
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs .	-3.9923
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-2.3557
The helicopter , manufactured in Connecticut , was exhibited next to a Maine yacht , Wisconsin fire brigade and Mississippi forklift truck .	-4.4204
The White House Military Office demanded the helicopter ’ s presence in a fragmentary order , or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-3.8303
" I just wanted you to be aware of this , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his supervisor , Deputy Naval Command for Aviation .	-4.6898
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn at 3 p.m. on 17 July at 7 a.m. until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-4.5401
The note adds that if departures from the White House were to be delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the restrictions on service hours .	-5.2996
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the unit ’ s security staff remained at the aircraft during the time on the ground .	-4.3332
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .	-4.1626
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-1.8908
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could break the determination .	-3.3933
" One question we asked was whether it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-3.4585
" Sounds as if you are closed , " replied the deputy commander .	-3.9876
The " Made in America " event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.8494
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.4679
At the event , the President gave impetus to the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations .	-5.6261
The use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-7.0222
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip .	-4.2889
But to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .	-3.4650
Trump carried out an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft performed taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of complaints about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential plane .	-4.7759
" The White House is thrilled by the show " Made In America " - which shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers using American materials , " said Deputy White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters .	-3.9625
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to deliver accurate centimetres to the US President in the White House .	-5.2934
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 carried out 58 practice landings in the White House .	-3.1476
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said one official .	-3.1931
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours this day for ' non-presidential support missions ' .	-3.1798
The White House said that taxpayers did not assume the burden for any of the other props presented at the event .	-3.0583
A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on South Lawn .	-3.4007
HMX-1 does not have budget drawings for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.5812
However , according to hourly tariffs by the US Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the DoD refund rate for VH-3D is $ 24,380 per flight hour .	-4.7909
Recordings of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.3462
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate .	-2.4157
" Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for refunds is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.8026
'These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget . '	-3.1276
According to a 2015 RAND study , reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance , and contract conclusion .	-4.0368
At that time , the former White House press officer , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-3.0479
" The idea is to present things made in America this week , " said Spicer .	-2.5053
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , of people depend on it .	-3.5465
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.0176
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.8955
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his South Lawn tour for the event , but he was in the driver ’ s seat of a fire-fighting car .	-4.8137
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-6.3140
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said , ' I have three of them ' .	-2.2128
TC BW Neuss ’ s Tricky Task	-3.8644
Top runner of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga starts at the table third Suchsdorf SV .	-9.2932
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will appear tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table third Suchsdorfer SV .	-4.8441
Despite five games , the top runner of the second tennis league has retained a sense of reality .	-6.0480
In any case , team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-4.1180
" This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar format .	-3.9060
I think the team is very good at the rear . '	-4.8735
For the quality and stability of the SV team , the imports from the far north are the most important .	-8.9829
" Their Danes and Finns can even refer to Davis Cup stakes .	-2.9968
And they are also strong in double , " says Zay looking at Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-2.2843
" As always , this will be difficult for us .	-2.9515
You also need good luck there . '	-3.3820
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north is practical .	-3.7756
His blue-white debut could give Maxime Janvier .	-2.4079
If the Frenchman who is currently active at the Challenger Tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga event , the Czech player Zdenek Kolar will play at the tournament in the Czech Liberec .	-7.3680
The hitherto unwon Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with Belarus Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel .	-4.3044
However , he should be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp , Niels Lootsma ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Julien Cagnina .	-3.6155
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster , Máté Valkusz could join the team again .	-4.0717
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian , who was the number one junior world ranking in January 2016 , someone from Marius Zay 's trainer club will fill up the cadre .	-6.8343
How America Can Bad OMV	-1.5933
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed Wednesday evening ’ s bill to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-3.4327
" In his haste to enact the law , " Congress packaged a few " unconstitutional regulations , " he appreciated .	-4.4721
The reaction from Moscow was as strong as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US move .	-3.7463
After all , the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.5111
Since then , investors from the domestic OMV , together with other European companies , have been concerned about the construction of the Nord Stream 2 Russian Baltic Sea pipeline .	-6.5843
The backdrop of threats is enormous .	-3.2390
Nevertheless , the oil company 's official statement states that it is too early to assess the impact .	-4.4881
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .	-3.9079
Twelve weapons are at his disposal .	-2.3535
" The press " looked at which the Group could defend itself and which could really hurt it .	-4.8860
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be focussed on Netflix 's hit series .	-4.2375
Despite the second season of Narcos , unveiling Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-2.6857
The three and four seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show .	-3.6356
With the third season , DEA has focused its attention on the world ’ s richest drug trafficking organization : the Cali cartel .	-3.6940
Led by four powerful sponsors , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more government bribes and violent actions .	-2.7725
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-1.7252
In the new trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña , the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs .	-3.2966
Other new actors are Matias Varela , Michael Stahl-David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .	-1.2989
The third season of Narcos will begin on 1 September .	-1.9218
Role backwards : The City is deploying 46 kitchen aids .	-4.6701
The city organizes the Kita lunch dinner itself again .	-3.7499
With permanent contact persons for the children and assignment to the team .	-4.6006
In the city nurseries , the clock is turned back .	-4.6048
As of September 1 , the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the city 's daycare facilities ( Kitas ) .	-6.1278
This is good news for Sonja Pommeranz , deputy head of the Youth Aid department : ' We have all been very pleased ' .	-8.2201
Cooking is still carried out outside the house : a caterer takes on this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled .	-6.2168
The city operates 46 daycare centers in Krefeld area , and 44 children receive a warm meal at midday .	-5.7931
Last year , there were 2800 children sitting at the tables and demand is growing steadily .	-5.8071
" In the meantime not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week eat lunch in the Kita , " explains Pommeranz .	-6.0196
'The offer shall also apply in the 35-hour service if children stay until 2 p.m. ' .	-4.7469
As of 1 September , 46 part-time employees will have kitchen services : they will warm up the food supplied , add salad , raw food and fruit , carry out the meal individually , give out the food , leave , wash and clean the kitchen .	-8.8677
" Employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-3.4589
The size - there are two groups as well as seven group units - determines the amount of hours .	-4.6813
" The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team , " says Pommeranz satisfied .	-3.9198
" Thus they are much more integrated and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the kite steering " .	-5.1463
It is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-4.0632
'Children should help prepare food ' .	-2.9007
The direct connection of kitchen power to the team makes sense .	-3.7446
Also for children .	-2.0228
" They have a known force in the kita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people " .	-3.8594
This continuity is important for children .	-1.2256
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - up to now also the job of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning staff .	-5.8176
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only improved the quality of the kitchen service but also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in comparing costs for the city 's own administration and foreign procurement , according to the press office .	-8.9132
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited .	-3.3496
" But these hours do not count as much as 750 people in education , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-5.1653
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN .	-1.9903
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .	-1.9940
Nicholas Haysom , President-in-Office of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will stand in provincial elections , with three women standing for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters being women .	-4.5451
" The role of women cannot be overestimated , " he said in a statement on Wednesday .	-1.6482
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.2189
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.0072
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .	-3.3329
This year , for the first time , the elections will peacefully transfer power from one democratically elected government to another .	-2.3508
Haysom said that a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan ’ s democratic success .	-2.2540
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered from 3.6 million registered voters .	-2.7504

On the occasion of the 110-year anniversary of its existence , TV Kaiseringen invites you to a small hike , followed by coffee and cake .	-5.2295
The hike starts on Sunday , July 9 , at 1pm in Frohnstetten at the water reservoir in Amerikastraße .	-3.8890
From there you go back to the airfield , to Natter and over the Waldhof back to the water reservoir .	-4.9353
The walk takes about an hour and a half .	-2.4889
Afterwards there is coffee , cakes , cool drinks , string sausages and cheese waking in Kaiseringen .	-4.7369
If you need a ride from Kaiseringen to Frohnstetten , the meeting point is in Kaiseringen at the school .	-4.4040
Men Attempt to Auct 13-year-old Girls	-3.0134
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday .	-2.6794
According to police information , the men approached the 13-year-olds who were on Kolping Street with friends at around 14.55 because they wanted to phone the girl 's mobile phone .	-5.7104
The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends .	-2.8573
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl 's cell phone and necklace , but failed .	-5.0319
The duo fled without loot .	-2.3560
The two young men were later arrested by the police .	-2.0286
The investigation is under way .	-1.5622
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-1.9664
A union wants to reassure Bishop McVitie managers of the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant .	-3.6977
GMB Scotland said the company had kept quiet about the future of investments at Tollcross .	-3.0062
More than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits , among other products .	-7.0502
McVitie 's owner , Pladis , said he has invested more than £ 5 million in recent years .	-2.8460
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be ' the first to know ' if their activities changed .	-3.9387
In a letter to the company 's head of branch , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called on ' to express concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being promoted ' .	-5.2113
GMB-senior organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about Tollcross 's business needs and investment plans for the future deeply affects our members .	-4.2155
Generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-4.3501
As a result , from the perspective of jobs , wages , and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , rising living costs , and a chronic decline in output , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving McVitie production presence . "	-5.4202
A spokeswoman from Pladis said : ' The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will react directly to it , as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-5.4632
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with Tollcross staff and GMB representatives at which some questions were discussed openly .	-3.5121
We discussed with our employees that , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-5.5921
She added : ' In recent years , we have invested more than £ 5 million in our Tollcross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.4568
We fully recognise Tollcross 's heritage as a production site and , if our operations at the site change , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know . '	-5.5894
Has the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago of Neymar ?	-2.4091
The League ’ s side may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-3.0636
Paris Saint-Germain will not slacken in her prosecution of Neymar after making an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the World Recoattack ?	-4.3645
The sensational approach fueled the transfer window in the summer , as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous record , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £ 89 million last season .	-4.2924
After completion , Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional player in the world .	-4.8394
Barcelona is angry at the way that Neymar forced his way out , though a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to look after him since he arrived from Santos in 2013 .	-4.6644
But was the World Cup president warned of this prospect three years ago ?	-3.0157
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to have one of the best players signed by PSG .	-4.0159
" I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-3.1781
" We respect all clubs .	-1.2051
But if they try to get one of our players signed with you , it will have consequences . '	-4.3526
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer .	-4.1716
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers to Neymar .	-3.9459

The car caused material damage .	-3.3805
The driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident .	-4.3704
According to the accident victim , it may well be that the Mercedes-Benz driver had not noticed the accident .	-9.4083
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the ' polluter pays ' driver to contact the Commission in Stolzenau on phone 05761 / 92060 .	-3.9850
Interview : ' Domspatzen Report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger '	-2.3528
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuses relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger .	-8.2605
This is what the author and historian Michael Hesemann says . , , , .	-6.4035
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen continues to provide for discussion .	-4.8570
Christian Weisnder , spokesman for the reform movement " We are Church " , explained to the German press agency after publication , that he expects an apology from the former bishop of Regensburg and today 's cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI .	-5.3197
It would greatly benefit the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their misappraisal of what happened at the time .	-4.3569
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticized the fact that " double standards " were applied to the reporting of violence in the cathedral lanes .	-5.9921
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that they are " shameful and shameful acts " that must be punished and prevented in the future ; but the " degree of media manipulation " , according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee .	-5.4705
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-4.1048
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk : " You are happy to go to the church and this is a found fresco " .	-5.0076
She also pointed out that in her youth , ' beatings were a normal pedagogical means ' to deal with naughty children like me ' .	-5.3077
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.5747
In connection with the reports of abuse cases , Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-5.4525
Quite wrongly , says author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial book " Mein Bruder der Papst " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-4.1250
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he assesses the results of the final report .	-3.5825
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber , commissioned by the Bishop of Regensburg ?	-4.1200
Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral treasures were sexually abused with high plausibility , and 67 Cathedral treasures were sexually abused .	-6.4092
In the final report it says about Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In summary , it can be said that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence were used by Domkapellmeister R. .	-5.2257
Especially with high emotionality , the punishment could be more severe for students .	-5.3473
Despite this , unlike many others , it is striking that many victims value the general humanity of R. R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence . "	-6.8622
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral pilgrimages Georg Ratzinger relieves in his opinion .	-5.1571
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the " incidents of violence against protective orders at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen " gives a contradictory picture of the master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger .	-5.3092
On the one hand , many students emphasize his " humanity " .	-3.4867
On the other hand , he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist , who often became handy when a cathedral treasure did not produce top performance musically .	-7.4043
How do you view this final report as his biographer ?	-2.5799
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble to read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it .	-6.4044
Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.6431
The violence processes at preschool were also taking place outside its sphere of effect .	-4.3707
He can be accused of being too late or of not taking initial suggestions seriously enough .	-5.1861
The domain grammar school on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-4.7340
Thus , the vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , give an excellent testimony , describing him as " warmhearted " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " sympathetic " , an extremely benevolent teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes , biscuits and bonuses and was " always surrounded by grapes from children " .	-6.9120
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which has led to outrage .	-4.6328
He himself admitted years ago that he was deeply saddened and apologized for not only sticking with stools and throwing the key bund on the floor , but also dragging the ears of distributed and all too naughty guys .	-10.4428
To save his honour , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , in the 1960s and 1970s , among parents and teachers alike .	-6.1320
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-3.6165
Of course , I think all of us who were born before 1968 .	-2.2882
I , too , have experienced this in a secular school , a state high school .	-3.8706
Compared to what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the pre-school violence processes , these are , of course , trivial .	-8.8633
One wonders if it is not more to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him .	-6.5459
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope .	-3.1094
The truth , however , is that the report relieves Mr Ratzinger from all aspects !	-4.1195
In connection with the report , a great deal has been reported in the media on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedral Columns .	-5.2864
Will Georg Ratzinger , in the final report , also be accused of any involvement or compassion with regard to sexual abuse ?	-4.9294
Michael Hesemann : Clearly no .	-2.1684
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the master of the cathedral .	-3.7230
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.7396
" I have never dared to talk to my father or my mother about this , " said one of the people concerned , on behalf of the others , " It was very embarrassing to me " .	-6.4410
The real problem in educating about sexual abuse was , and is , that most victims remain silent out of shame .	-4.0850
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings , it would certainly not be a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally .	-5.5604
How do the Domspatzen-students rate Ratzinger ’ s role in cases of abuse ?	-5.1604
Michael Hesemann : As one interviewed pupil put it : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which it was he ( Georg Ratzinger ) who could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator .	-7.5558
I also think it is really absurd to assume that it is he who ... has opened his hands more forcefully or clearly , or even more so , than to their parents , boarding school leaders , trust teachers , etc .	-9.7090
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.6288
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that pupils and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation ' .	-6.5800
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , therefore , Georg Ratzinger is free from any form of cognition .	-5.1976
Nor can he be accused of not obstructing or bringing him to justice .	-4.4549
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these odious crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.9108
The media read a lot of " violent processes " at the Regensburg Cathedral Columns .	-5.0054
The former master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report " Wegschauen " .	-4.5297
Does he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.5408
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence processes and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.1159
But that is another abuse of the report .	-3.0884
There is a clean separation between the preschool school and the secondary school of the cathedral , between sexual abuse and violence and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.0262
In addition , the report deals with incidents dating back to 1945 , that is , also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir conductor of the Cathedral 's spheres .	-6.3038
All the terrible caning pedagogy , the cases in which boys from sadistic teachers were actually harassed and maltreated and suffered horribly , all took place on the preschool school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed .	-6.5089
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he only got the boys on his face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium .	-5.0026
On this , as most witnesses stress , the topic of pre-school was taboo .	-4.0442
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-4.2794
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-2.5202
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-2.7858
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims value the general humanity of R. R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence ' .	-5.8224
At most , the accusation remains of having looked away .	-3.9006
Despite all the efforts , however , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported on the pre-school conditions .	-4.9750
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and did not want to hear about the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( according to the witness ) , and then again around 1993 .	-6.6287
Georg Ratzinger consistently closed his ears before the conditions ?	-2.9870
Michael Hesemann : No , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.1222
In it he points out to them that ' caning is still practised in preschool ' .	-5.4233
Even in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-4.0870
This was , of course , at a time when there was legal clarity when caning sentences had long been banned in Bavaria .	-4.4099
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as we all know .	-3.6974
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the people affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the permitted limit had actually been exceeded .	-6.1155
Nor can we say that he has always looked away .	-3.1507
That is simply not true .	-1.3161
It was only in 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-2.9329
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to the times .	-3.9725
How do you see that ?	-1.5209
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " trap of anachronism " , that is , the danger of judging past by today 's moral standards .	-4.0467
The prince is right .	-2.5735
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was odious at all times , or to what was buried in the pre-school school of conflict and violence on innocent children 's souls , which goes far beyond what was then common .	-8.0459
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being addressed .	-4.3118
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all that had nothing to do with him .	-3.1342
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to say , slapping the ears and hairs , were widespread in the 1970s .	-7.1891
When physical punishment was then banned , he also adhered strictly to it .	-3.2258
What image of his time in Regensburg was given by Georg Ratzinger in the conversations with you for the book " Mein Bruder der Papst " ?	-4.5762
Did the issue of caning also arise ?	-3.5851
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his point of view , because the domes played only a side role .	-5.2408
Nevertheless , I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.2171
However , this must be said once again : without this perfectionism , without demanding unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world renown from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburg Cathedral spatzen , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-6.3371
With biscuits and bonbons alone , you do not turn recalcitrant boys into great singers and face every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self-reliance .	-7.2266
What kind of person did you experience in the conversations with Georg Ratzinger about her book ?	-5.0681
Michael Hesemann : By working on the book and beyond , I have really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have seen him again and again as a wonderful , humorous , good-natured , deeply believing and heartfelt person , and one cannot imagine that he could do anything for a fly .	-8.4507
I regularly get to know how many former domes still keep in contact with him today , 23 years after his departure , visit him , read him out - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .	-6.1005
So those who still do not forgive him that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-4.1244
Most of the domes are grateful to him today for having enriched their lives and brought the world of music to them .	-8.4483
And that he was always a good father - a strict father , of course , that may be his father - but he was also a kind respected figure , to whom they are still looking up today and who they almost revere .	-8.3287
I would like to make it quite clear once again that all the accusations against him are methods of education that were the order of the day at the time .	-6.7130
We can be pleased that we have long since overcome this period .	-3.9622
But it is highly unfair to turn a man into a media scapegoat simply because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother .	-2.9293
The evil intent behind this is all too obvious .	-2.9481
Because the report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.6894
Now the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit and without whom no one would know the Regensburg Cathedral spheres outside Bavaria , and perhaps even Germany , should finally be in peace .	-10.9134
