To his fans he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights he has now gained : " Rule one : goes NIE goes to Inas night .	-5.9772
Rule two : never drink the black sau .	-1.4418
And injection .	-1.3860
And the round of Eierlikör , which smells the Ina around half three , also let away .	-5.6341
Alcohol consumption is literally written in the face of the 43-year-old .	-3.7603

They range from instant bridges , fish crumbs or , probably the most effective - headache tablets .	-7.4274
Others simply amused the sight of the normally attractive cinema .	-5.5388
As Ina Müller has survived the night suction store , it is not known .	-5.7036

On a beer with Ina Müller .	-1.3023
Treysa has Vandalism and Unrat	-2.4604
The entry into the 36 km long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired .	-4.9285
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought , but solutions are hardly apparent .	-3.2792
Scherben , cigarette kippers , garbage and squeeze , demolished dustbin and now dismantled signboards - for a long time now , the entry with a seat group to the cycle path on the Haaße Hill in Treysa .	-9.4072
For the flagship project Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland , a more than an awful sight .	-6.9091
The topic occupies members of the ADFC group Schwalmstadt as well as others for a long time , as the .	-7.2355
The problem has already been raised in the cycling advisory board .	-3.8702
There has not been a solution yet .	-7.4516
The proposals range from the installation of the seat group to regular waste storage and cleaning of the areas at the entry point .	-6.9259
" I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible further activities " , says Wüstenhagen .	-4.2889
Guido Hahn ( ADFC ) reports that they have also brought the topic into the local advisory board .	-4.8754
Not only the rubbish drives cyclists and residents - the group is a regular meeting place at weekends .	-4.8879
It is not only often heard loud , but it is also destroyed : posts are torn out of the earth , dustbin demolished , shields around , seat furniture .	-10.1370
Volunteers have already cleared up more frequently , ADFC member Susanne Klippert .	-3.1023
The actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean .	-2.6334
You are annoying that the Rastplatz on the bicycle path in Treysa is a meeting point for saufcamps .	-6.2210
" Along the entire cycle path , there is a clear focus on the Haaße hill " , the radar operator , who is now also concerned about the new radar station in goat hain , which is being opened today .	-15.5994
'If it makes the same fate , it will be very expensive ' .	-4.9687
Another idea is a video surveillance at the hill : " Perhaps this will significantly increase the threshold of intervening in the community .	-7.0937
This would require , however , require a police force to pass quickly .	-6.3506
In principle , Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill .	-3.2670
It must be made more attractive .	-1.2231
With the frequency of the cycle path , you can be very satisfied .	-5.7640
The marketing of tourism is still able to develop .	-3.7876
Our cycling path is very high quality compared to others in Germany , " says ADFC members .	-4.9205
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa .	-2.6978
There is no abbias on the Haaße hill .	-4.0769
In the case of traffic , cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow " , explains them .	-5.7752
This is not a problem for sportive drivers , but for the elderly and especially for children .	-4.1791
Music Contest in the cultural station : The " Kö von Hiltrup " and the lake " .	-4.1605
The first call to the music contest was a success , creative and co-existence .	-3.3052
" D a song for Hiltrup " is the appeal of Hiltrup " , in the " Music contest for large and small , young and experienced musicians " .	-4.7230
A contest " with eyebrows in the sympathetic Hiltruper family " , as Karl Franke put it .	-4.2043
In fact , it was soon a family coexistence with coffee and cakes from the cultural station of honour .	-5.8183
Seven formations began , from the one-man band band to the great ensemble : Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied , Henk Humberg with guitar , Rolf Ihmig , a long albachtener , the nine of the " Hiltruper Sternfarben " , three members and three generations of Trenkamp and Claus , an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties .	-5.3519
This contest , said district mayor Joachim Schmidt , is a novelty .	-3.6838
We have not yet seen this in other parts of the city .	-2.7930
What were the texters associated with ?	-3.6086
In the places the Hiltruper lake and the market allee were particularly frequently mentioned .	-6.3223
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his hitting song to " Kö von Hiltrup " .	-4.0500
The cultural station was also appreciated .	-2.8820
Time and again it was about the experience of co-existence in these places , especially Alvin Jasic .	-5.7781
Karl Franke revived the short changes with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their work .	-5.1438
He learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry , but now also taught guitar .	-4.8693
Franke knew about Tontechnician Stefan Schemmelmann that the recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest .	-4.7056
And Alvin Jasic has placed all of them on Youtube .	-3.1616
" It is not about winning , " Franke said .	-2.0486
In fact , all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy .	-2.2536
There was something special for the jury ’ s favorites - so that others can hear their songs .	-4.4881
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechnician Schemmelmann .	-2.0542
Other musicians can record a song : Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer , who impressed Franke with his music , and the " Lummerland-Rudel " : " a very beautiful performance " with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon , Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle .	-5.9879
Like everyone , the children came up again for the final - and even sounded " right " , as Franke said .	-7.3601
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality , relation to Hiltrup , intransigence of melody and recognition .	-4.8845
The jury belonged Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik , Andreas Klomfaß von KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Business Verbund and Jan Kaven , Chairman of the district offensive .	-4.8440
The city ’ s offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence .	-5.1527
She appreciated the event as a full success .	-3.2547
All are " very satisfied " and " the atmosphere was good " in the soon very full cultural station .	-3.5104
The word game : " Decrypto " in the game .	-3.7887
The players form two teams sitting opposite each other .	-4.2865
For each page there is a view screen , in which four cards with keywords that you can only decipher the old trick with the red slide .	-7.5316
This ensures that the other side can read nothing .	-5.3469
On the cards , for example , you can read from left to right : " 1st Renaissance .	-4.5968
2 .	-5.9916
3 dice .	-0.8470
4 . Fest " .	-1.9417
These are the terms that must be encrypted .	-3.2591
For guess , it is not the terms but codes .	-4.7243
One player per team is the encryption .	-3.2092
He gets a code card on which may be " 3.4.2 " .	-3.6048
In " Decrypto " , not the terms behind the secret film but their encryption codes .	-4.5767
His task in this case : he should describe the terms " dice " , " feast " and " windows " - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as possible ; because that wins the game if he manages twice to crack the code .	-7.3206
So the encryptor notes and reads loud : " Werfen " for the dice , " Lose " as opposed to festival ; here would of course be something like " party " and " Prague " because he watched in school and knows the window .	-8.9448
This is how the round for round , team for team .	-6.4893
You do not know the terms of the opposite side - but you can better get together with any hint that the encryption gives there .	-7.8364

New Week , New Chance for the Government	-2.1560
Returning to material work - this is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition ’ s working week .	-5.1648
Hardly an interview , hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU , SPD and CSU have not recently summoned the " return to the material work " .	-6.5700
This may have led to some craftsmen , doctors , cassetters and other working citizens in that country have led to the legitimate question , what is the difference between work and work , but be it .	-8.8448
If the Federal Government is ready to return to its mandate - governance - it should not be discouraged from talking about terms .	-6.5872

The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or training .	-3.6307
The Union is strongly opposed to the ' track change ' from the asylum system into the labour market .	-3.7138
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners , and how should it be different ?	-4.1775
Not just and the same thing has joined GroKo , but three partners with very different social images and priorities .	-6.0353
Dispute is good .	-1.5941
Without dispute , a society characterized by such diverse , sometimes contradictory interests .	-4.4377
In order to be constructive , however , disputes must not be raised again for party tactical reasons .	-6.8032
We are still talking about politics , not theatre .	-2.7650
The Union and the SPD are supposed to fight - but always look at the real life of the people . . , , , . . , . , and . , .	-10.5461
What is feasible and benefits many ?	-2.0630
With this key issue , both diesel and track change can be pragmatically clarified - and thus regain confidence .	-4.9779

Is the Minister of Labour against current services law ?	-4.4002
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at this .	-1.8863
" Really day and night " their legists had worked on social security reform , a superfluous social minister reported when presenting the same same two weeks ago .	-6.0383
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger , the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein ( FPÖ ) is amazed - she brings the matter to Parliament via request .	-5.2407

At the time , violence had also occurred when trying to prevent citizens from voting .	-5.5036
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep separating the demonstrations of separatists and the central state security forces , reported Spanish media .	-5.8344
However , some of the 6000 separatists would then have tried to break the police chain and , among other things , using colour bags and eggs .	-6.3117
Six people had been arrested , 24 others were easily injured , and they were called upon by the authorities .	-5.9445

There was no danger of missing torchance , because there was virtually no one .	-4.8507
First shot after half an hour	-2.0053
Nick Flock was responsible for the first ( harmless ) blast Nick Flock .	-10.7063
The best - and in principle only true - was the Ahlener , when Cihan Yilmaz FCG Torwart Frederic Westergerling Frederic Westergerling , after 32 minutes with a shot from the ceiling .	-5.9926
The hosts were even more harmless .	-1.7312
Their most effective action consisted of early change .	-3.3176
Storm Lars Schröder had to be exchanged for injuries , for him came Sinan Aygün .	-4.9569
After the change , both teams decided to do something against the increasingly emerging boredom .	-2.8413

RWA-Interimstrainer Angelo Daut reacted , first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy ( 60th ) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian mothers ( 70 ) .	-3.7159
It did nothing .	-1.4683
More than optical superiority thanks to his own initiative , the Ahlener did not achieve anything .	-4.5264
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance , but neither did it .	-3.6795
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive : " I like we played to zero " , but unfortunately the zero was on the front .	-6.8216
" We were not as tordangerously as we were against Wood wickede and that although our opponent had no desire to play here " , RW Ahlens Interimstrainer .	-6.9121
Offensively " everything advocated a bit " against a team that only wanted to defend .	-5.6290
In any case , I did not feel that we could get a counter-gate ' , so thumb .	-4.7043
However , as a spectator did not feel that his team could shoot a gateway .	-5.2322
The idea was too poor .	-7.3634

But there is enough chalmers .	-1.6674
And the " replacement " could not be taken to entertain the ever-increasing audience .	-7.2572
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at late hour .	-4.4385
" Simply great " , Marcel Kreimer was happy .	-3.3243
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule this time .	-4.1676

The latter still has a speciality .	-3.2956
Honey cakes in the glass , of course with honey from my own production .	-2.3363
Here the little Elsa had to access again and again , so good the cake .	-7.1467
The sociability is that the visitors then stayed long until the evening hours , even without a stage programme that is not available at the Autumn Festival .	-8.2264
Blacksmithing with local embassy : No successful advertising for skateboarding equipment	-5.7984
In Lengerich , unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate plant in Lengerich .	-5.3527
In several places , there are corresponding lubricants , Jürgen Kohne of the City Administration on request from the WN .	-5.9326
In at least one case , criminal charges have been imposed on the police .	-5.9172
The three words " Skatepark for Lengerich ! " in large letters on signs , among other things , the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall .	-5.7738
Michael Rottmann , manager of the hall , reports that an appropriate font had been discovered at the entrance of the Gempt-Bistro on 19 September .	-5.6700
Since the short message appears to have been " left with an Edding , they have been able to be removed easily .	-6.9849
" Just a few days later , this was blown up again , " says Rottmann .	-5.9101
It assumes that the appropriate advertising shield must be replaced .	-3.5100
A special note gets this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the table .	-6.9577
If the skatepark is built , the project will be made possible by sponsors .	-5.9856
Jörg Hesselmann has already made promises , from the urban field of school , sport and culture .	-6.6681
Well possible , however , that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the covered table .	-5.3465
For years , local politics and administration have been dealing with the issue of skateboarding .	-4.6515
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic , the search for an alternative location began .	-5.3236
The majority of the Council spoke out in favour of the fire-fighting park .	-4.5813
However , it was not implemented - too many factors seem to have spoken against building here .	-5.5371
At the end of June , a U-turn followed .	-2.2340
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School .	-9.7606
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning .	-3.9441

Bad air traffic control gets worse	-5.8001
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer , German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year .	-3.6328
" This year we had wind , 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm , " said the head of the trade union of air traffic control , Matthias Maas , the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg .	-4.8621
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known human resources problem in European air safety , for which there is no rapid solution .	-6.0988
" Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year , but the training of new pilots takes four to five years , " said the trade unionist .	-3.7762
Across Europe , the market for ready-trained pilots is empty .	-4.4528
Some hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe for monitoring the upper German airspace .	-3.8141
Maas once again criticised the fact that various trade unions were not invited to the summit .	-2.4913
In the Hanseatic City , representatives of the federal , the countries , air traffic control , airlines and airports will meet the causes of delays .	-5.7186
" If you want to talk about additional workload and overtime , this will not go without us , " the head of the GdF , who has many members at the German Air Safety Insurance .	-7.5488
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for pilotage misery .	-4.3270
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period that runs until 2019 have been far too low .	-3.6031
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings in national air traffic control are now fully integrated into operational business .	-6.4709
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer ( CSU ) to work in Brussels for regulations that do not clean air traffic control .	-6.5588
At present , EU standards would be voted by 2024 and there would be further tightened up .	-5.1616
The EU is subject to constant pressure from airlines .	-2.8436
" Ryanair chief Michael O 'Leary and his colleagues now reap exactly what they have sowed in recent years , " Maas said .	-3.4902
He hope that the high delays in airlines will take a rethink .	-4.9493
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung ( DFS ) offers a " coherent training and future pact " , Maas said .	-4.5407
The record of 120 piloters per year over the next five years is sufficient to compensate for the age-related outages .	-7.7142
The necessary personnel building is not yet connected with this .	-3.9114

Both companies should be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange .	-3.1388
