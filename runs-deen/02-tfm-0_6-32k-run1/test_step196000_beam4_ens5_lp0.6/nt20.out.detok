Rätsel solved: That is why we cannot fool ourselves.
A kind of brake in the grandfather ’ s brain prevents people from ticking themselves, as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments on rats how they were communicating on Thursday evening, with progress being made on the question of why children are so fiercely opposed to the tickling, only to ask for more.
After all, it has also become apparent why the sewing of a rooting hand is already extinguishing in front of the touching laugh, which is at a layer in in, with the sal.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound area if they are ingrained by humans.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch.
This is the reason why the researchers of Berlin found that in experiments on rats, the laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the large brain was suppressed during a self-contacting process, even if living beings themselves are touching.
It is also the case that the brain does not touch the rats between the self-contact and the touch of the touch of the touch, and the touch of the touch by others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and,,,,
In the early stages of the experiment, the curse behaviour or frightening behaviour of the children were the same.

Iran Frees Britain ’ s Tankers. the. the. the the the the the the the
The United Nations General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict, but there is now a problem less: the British oil tanker, Stena Impero, held in Iran, could be a puzzle in Iran ’ s President Ruhani ’ s peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has been held by Hormus in Iran since mid-July.
"Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew went to Dubai for medical examinations, said Reedereichef Erik Hånell.
We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law, which was stated in a communication on Friday.
On 19 July, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards reproached the tanker for disregarding the provisions of the Persian Gulf Law and released 23 crew members at the beginning of September; the remaining 16 crewmembers the, Hånell, with the situation over the past.
The British Government suspected that the 'Stena Impero' was a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: a supertanker with oil from Iran at the beginning of July intended for Syria had been put on the chain, and that the supply had, according to the authorities, been subject to EU sanctions against the warland of Syria.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences.
The road from Hormus is one of the most important maritime routes in the world, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean, and much of the world ’ s oil exports are shipped by the Straits, and tensions in the region have intensified over the past few months, trade with the conflict between the and with Iran.
The United States has signed a treaty with the United States that would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and end its political and economic isolation since the US government the in the with massive economic sanctions against the country to more with pressure to more.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition to protect the commercial vessels in the region.
President Hassan Ruhani of Iran presented a plan for security and peace in the Straits of Hormus at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, with the initiative 'Coalition of Hope' for the Persian Gulf of Iran, along with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign security the of shipping in the Gulf of Persian.
India is looking to a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India would, in fact, be destined to become a "war winner," with punitive tariffs imposed by America ’ s President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, forcing foreign producers in the People ’ s Republic to reshape financial chiefs of Asian firms that consider relocating their production from China to another country, calling India into a UBS poll as one of America ’ s preferred alternatives, but not just the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war.
But now India has come to Trump ’ s own attention, with domestic tariffs deducting trade favors for 2000 products from the Haudegen in the House as “the Kingdom of Tariffs. ” The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and other goods.
In addition, America is the world ’ s largest democracy through security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine concerns about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a Salve of American impunity against India seems unlikely, and India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just resigned for a second five-year term, is likely to weigh in security.
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically upset thesis that open markets have accelerated economic development, in the Socialist Republic of India has a serious state of play, and Modi, whose reformist eagerness is mainly aimed at bureaucratic madness, which in the multi-ethnic state has all too long received any entrepreneurial spirit.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings, but in India, optics has turned out to be far better in the first five Modi years, but trade policy is not the case, with too many internationally uncompetitive companies protecting foreign suppliers, even imposing new barriers on the national conservative government.
In the West, Modi of the Nimbus of the vigorous reformer who radically renews his country, a perception not least of the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At the core of the "India First" advocate but never of economic, which prevents Indian firms from becoming more anachronistic processes and becoming for global competition.

Millionenmachine: Egyptians are preparing for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible anti-government protests, with a reinforced police presence on Friday at the center of Cairo, with several subway stations remaining closed to the central Tahrir Square.
Already in recent days, the police had stepped up their road controls, and the mobile phones of pedestrians were partially searched for news and photos related to the protests.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, and Mansura, hundreds of participants protested against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ’ s government, the critic of corruption and mismanagement, and an open protest against Egypt ’ s political leadership for years, not to mention the Spanish exile of Egyptian construction contractors and actor Mohammed Ali, who launched demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for the “Millionenmarsch ” in the country.
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) told more than 1,570 arrests, and the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily arrested", "only because they were 'at the wrong time in the wrong place'," said HRW under appeal to lawyers of detainees with whom the accusations against the detainees, according to their lawyers, range from "dissemination of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association".
HRW also criticised censorship in the North African country, which blocks the government in Cairo ’ s websites and online services to block further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Transit traders should be able to donate returns more easily.
For online retailers, many backpacks are lost, with around 20 million returns to the rubbish, but there is an alternative.
The Treasury has shown online traders like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate back products rather than destroy them.
Although the company could not be exempted from the VAT on donations in kind, the ministry stated on a question of the Grünen-Bundestagsfraktion, on which the newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday, the traders could, however, set the market value of the buggy returns so low that they would not have to pay or pay little VAT.

The image could change the owner for one millionth day.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at the first meeting of the House of Commons, took the Supreme Court for a hard exchange with the opposition, following the ouster of a cascade of Johnson ’ s forced recess. Johnson already wants to hold a double Brexit on October 31, even without agreements with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes in the Brexit debate; in Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man breaking a star of the European flag, with thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’ s fierce verbal attacks on Brexiteers in Parliament do not, in his opinion, contribute to a climate of hatred, and, compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a “walk in the park ”, Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation.
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the last few days and accused them, among other things, "betrayal" on the people, accusations that he could put Members at risk because they could be targeted at threats of murder, he did as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to restore calm was to respect British MEPs ’ decision to leave the EU at long last; it is not surprising that people were upset that Britain had not yet emerged from the EU three years after the referendum.
We should talk to each other with respect, 'it was said in a statement' and we should also listen '.
Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Khan calls for uno-intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan ’ s prime minister, Imran Khan, once again called upon the United Nations General Assembly to intervene in the Kashmir conflict when he first appeared.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely to take place on Friday at the United Nations General Debate in New York. "If that is going badly, one hopes for the best, but are prepared for the worst." The United Nations should have had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You must have avoided that."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them the divided region of Kashmir, both of which have dominated a part of Kashmir, another part of which was China.
Not a Bottle of Water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Egypt ’ s current protests have reacted hand in hand with the government; it has left the population with sharp ammunition, more than 2,000 detainees socialize in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there; protests have never been safe in Egypt; but, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ’ s takeover in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything it can to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring era.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation, poverty, lack of prospects, and the sense of being stifled by one ’ s own government, driving millions onto the streets, and that is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how tough it is against opponents.
Today, anyone living in Egypt below the poverty line, since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the rate of inflation is 10%, and anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who to finance it: Nestlé, Coca-Cola, or the military – the latter is not only responsible for suppressing it, but also the largest economic actor – the military is,,,,, producing,, producing,, and much more.
Tüv-Prüfungen im Terminal: BER-Chef: Keine "Showstopper" mehr für Hauptstadtflughafen.

Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables still need to be remedied; the Tüv wants to examine them by February; 'In order to create the conditions for the take-up of the aircraft, we must continue to work intensively to deal with the deficiencies', it was stated in a written communication.
In many cases, Liège Daldrup said that there is a lack of evidence to reduce the number of new cables, and that there is no release for all the nozzles on which the cables are hanging, and the airport chief that this is by the end.
In addition, the fire protection system is still not working satisfactorily at the railway station under the terminal, and the problems had already led to another crisis three years ago, which is about smoke spikes, which are going down in a fire like a canvas, so that the smoke does not spread.
The costs have increased from €2 billion since the beginning of 2006 to around €6.5 billion in the next year.

Study of causes of heart disease
There are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, smoking, obesity, unhealthy nutrition, but what does a heart weakness or an infarct really solve?
Through the analysis of the inheritance of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to find out the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday that the Kühne Foundation supports the project with EUR 12.5 million, and the high-altitude clinic of Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital of Zurich.
The combination of genes and external influences, however, is only insufficiently known.
More than 4,000 of the 20,000 relevant human genes are currently known as potential pathogenic changes in DNA - so-called mutations - and the clinic said that around 200 would be added each year.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options, such as prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks, as well as research into other people diseases, Stefan Blankenberg, head of heart and vascular centre.

World Football Summary: More Proposals for Messis and Cloning Shorter
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent.
With a gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association is the best player, the best coach of the year, and for Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he had never voted in the World Cup election, allegations of the Fifa came from other countries, not to mention Egypt, on a curious grounds.
Much of the Fifa has proven to be a bad thing in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans by its president, Gianni Infantino, the generalized behavior of divergent corrupt officials, but the Fifa World Cup election so,, when, that the national and national team of member are more,, rather, after.
But, having already lamented Nicaragua ’ s captain, he did not vote at all, more inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the voices of national trainers Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account; indeed, they are appearing in the official and publicly accessible vote.
The Fifa apologises for the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms in capital letters have been issued and therefore have not been valid".
Sudans Trainer also surprised
In the case of Egypt, the Sudanese Association states that the Zdravko Lugarisic trainer did not vote as it was done: with Lionel Messi on Square one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three.
He was the first to be elected president of the United States, and was the first to be elected in the United States.
On Friday, the association reported that the vote was not intended, but of course it was not intended.
The other cases allow the Fifa to be examined in an investigation, but stresses that the ballot was supervised by PriceWaterhouseCoopers consultancy, while Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Cup election - and Jürgen Klopp world trainer of the year.
Ukraine-affair: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation.
Two senior Republicans have openly advocated an official investigation against US President Donald Trump and party friend, "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, the facts are determined that will be found," He more about Whibefore.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine, according to which Trump has been for.
The Republicans have so far withstood criticism of Trump for the whistleblower-case affair, but few have shown unease, and Scott ’ s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party, with Trump ’ s moderate Governor of Virginia repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as to loosening environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules.
As a further senior Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also advocated the investigation, "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the bottom."
Scott and Baker, as the governor of US states, formally have no say in the case of Trump, which is decided in Congress, and their statements are therefore, above all, symbolic, but even the first senators of Republicans have been critical of the situation, and Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the federal state of Utah in the second parliamentary chamber, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also report that the Republicans are first cracking internally.
The affair could result in the launch of an impeachment procedure against Trump, which Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into it, blaming him for abuse of power the purpose of foreign for political.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment procedure, with the majority in the House of Representatives holding a so-called “impeachment. ” So the decision on actual impeachment, but in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority, has so far not been a US president through an impeachment process.

Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car company a powerful boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record figures.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," wrote Musk in a mail posted by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.

US budget dispute: Renews only bridge-financing
The new budget year will start on 1 October in the United States without a proper budget, and the Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on transitional funding by 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed on an increase in spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, the United States is facing a new fiscal year beginning on October 1, even more without spending plans, followed by a transition (Continuing Resolution, CR) by November 21, without,, the. a decision would have come into on Monday at.
Shutdown turned down
For the time being, the Federal Government will be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019, which, because Congress did not agree on the 12 spending laws in time, can allocate funds to the various departments and authorities, so the Federal Government cannot benefit from the new budget year from 1.3 Bios to 1.4 Bio. $expanded.. the.
The Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, have completed ten of the twelve laws, but the spending laws reflect the Democrats ’ priorities, which have scarcely any chance in the Republican-dominated Senate.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion to build the wall, one of the major priorities of President Trump, and the Democrats are interfering with the Mauerbau wall plans and their funding, which is intended for other military construction and projects, and the dispute over the wall was already escalated in December 2018, and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
On Mauerbau the Ghosts.
At the moment, it is unclear how the parties are going to come closer to this issue, and it is more likely that an agreement will be reached on all twelve spending laws over the next seven weeks, extending the transitional funding beyond 21 November, and that a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the backdrop of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automation of the process of popularity are gaining ground.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, the artificial fertilization of women and lesbians living in the future is to be revealed: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that would allow all women to benefit from in-vitro fertilization, thereby significantly increasing demand for anonymous seed donation.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future, and the French bishop conference is against innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, the health minister, Agnès Buzyn, defended as an "chance" for society; it is the modern family, in which children are to be taken with only one parent or homosexual parents, and the costs of artificial fertilization for all women are borne by social security.
Restricting with sperm of dead husband further prohibited
In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial insemination of "post-mortem", in in in Germany in in the of the of a.,, the of in. the of, the of. the, the. the the of. the the. the the of. the the.
Many members of the governing party La République en Marche (The Republic of the Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition opposed the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair for a widow to be able to be fertile in the future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with the partner of her own.
Until now, artificial fertilization in France is only permitted for heterosexual couples who cannot bear witness to children, who must be married or have lived together for at least two years, and Buzy,,,.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, however, it is often difficult.
Compensation payments for climate: Call for Unis flight charges will be louder.
There is a lot of logging in to universities, which is why the country wants to have a climate levy in the future, and the rectors say that they have no money to do so, but they are now also coming under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte.
This is the first step that the Green Party had to take, and the plans are now being supported by the universities, in a joint declaration that the PhD students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a Pädagogische Hochschule für eine Kompensation von Dienstflügen.
Russia Records North Korean Fischer
According to the FSB ’ s secret service, the detainees were caught illegally in Russian waters, and ten days earlier, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea, and there was a shift of fire between the border guards and the crew, with three Russians and a North Koreans injured, and the fisherman was injured later in his serious injuries, but there.....,.
The North Korean Communist Party is suffering from chronic food shortages, and North Korean fishermen have therefore travelled to Russian territorial waters, where Russia's coastguard is carrying out its own claims to protect its marine biological resources.
Appropriate 30,000 Tint Fish
In the case of the new controls, 30,000 octopus have been discovered and confiscated on the boats, and three fishing and two motor boats have been confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet by Vladiwostok.
Russia ’ s fishing authority had not issued a fishing licence to North Koreans this year, even after the actions of indigenous entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korea ’ s fishermen have been temporarily detained there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who fished with mesh synthetic nets burned in Russia, and also brought small creatures out of the sea, and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be dismantled.
In the future, only 18 000: USA will lower the asylum ceiling.
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is complying with protections: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the ceiling on the legal migration of refugees will continue to be lowered.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low limit on the admission of new refugees once again; in the 2020 economic year, which will run in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, at most 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the US State Department has said; in the now almost remote economic year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has slashed the world ’ s readiness to absorb the world ’ s protectors in recent years. Under Barack Obama ’ s predecessor government, much higher caps were gilded.
The target of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980, yet the State Department called the US “the most impoverished and most generous nation in history, ” a phrase strongly reminiscent of the US president ’ s use of language.
“Responsible handling ” of refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild, Trump declared. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of reassurance from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
One major contentious point is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal, and to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency Board. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear, Trump is currently under threat of the Selenskyj affair and an impending impeachment of impeachment.
The US government wants to focus its attention on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who helped the US military in the country, who are in danger of being born out of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs's statement, while Guatemala and El Salvador are expected to receive a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The US wants people in particular from this' northern triangle 'of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries, with the United States having concluded migration agreements with Guatemala, and now with El Salvador and Honduras, in order to reduce immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.

Conflict between Iran and the US: Rouhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts.
President Hassan Ruhani, Iran, has spoken of the United States offering to lift sanctions following his return from the UN General Assembly, and the United States, in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, has promised an end to all sanctions, declared Ruhani on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, opposed the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift sanctions against him so that there was a meeting.
The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that there should be a meeting. "And America says, I lift the sanctions on", supplemented Ruhani.
However, this is not an acceptable way of doing things, and in the light of the penalties and the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, Mr Ruhani criticised the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York, with the hope of saving Europeans from the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated with Russia and China, which is supposed to deter the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France ’ s president, Emmanuel Macron, had expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquakes near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes hit Turkey in the shortest possible time, the fear of a disaster has increased, and 34 people have been injured in the earthquake on Tuesday, with almost 200 aftershocks having occurred since, the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
The earthquake of 5.8 had shaken the Marmararegion in front of Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions, and now the government wants to deploy a commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes, Oktay announced.
In the last 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul ’ s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and,,,, the threat of,,, the many earthquakes that hit Istanbul regularly.
The city planners, such as the famous architect Mücella Yapici, have been warning for years that large open areas, which have been registered in the centre as sanctuaries, have long since been built, and only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük Bebens in August, the Construction Engineer of Istanbul, estimated that one million buildings in Istanbul are not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the earthquake of Thursday was in the Marmara district of Silivri, and in about seven kilometers deep, as the Afad Civil Protection Agency announced.
He was the first to report the damage done to people who were buried in houses in Panic, and students were taken from the Silivri district for security reasons.
Istanbul is one of the most important cities in the world.
Researchers fear that an earthquake could threaten 7.1 to 7.4, but when the earthquake occurs, it is unclear, with the earthquake on Thursday, the West of the country and Istanbul meeting again.
Companies design emergency plans, private individuals have completed so-called Go-Bags with everything needed to stand next door, and schools bring children to behave like they did when the earth wakes. When the next big earthquake comes, it is unclear.
The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said that eight people had been injured after his return from New York, and that some buildings had suffered slight damage; the Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu tracthe developments of in the district, Avci, and Sari.
Warning Before Posting in Istanbul

It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 struck the Turkish Marmararegion - it was felt until Istanbul, and its epicenter was located in the Marmara west of the metropolis, that the civil protection authority Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines on this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that - - will cause massive damage.
In the early 20th century, the population of the city was estimated to have been the largest in the world.
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul, and in Albania there was also a violent earthquake just a few days ago - there were 68 injured, and this year, too, the earth had lived in the Lake Constance.

Stocking Brexit Negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute.
Indeed, Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly stated that he is not going to give him a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements are going on in the UK ’ s polarizing Britons for ever, and the recent ruling by the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom is hovering like a sword of Damocles over the blondshopf, with his suspension of Parliament to carry out his Brexit course until the exit date, was cancelled earlier this week, and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to return to negotiations with the EU until 31 October to renew bilateral talks.
Boris Johnson still considers Deal to be possible.

A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump may, after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, be confronted with an impeachment process that Democrats want to examine as quickly as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - the speech is about weeks until a decision is taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, supposedly the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj stands, the reproach of whistleblowers who expressed concern for national security and democracy in the US with his complaint to the public is monstrous: the president has abused the power of his office to instruct the government of another country to influence the 2020 election, using Ukraine ’ s dependence on Ukraine in blackmail and forcing it to take action against a political opponent.
The nucleus of this project is also reflected in the interlocutor ’ s signature with Selenskyj, which has now been published, although it does not fully reflect the full text.
The story is from the point of view of the public in May 2019, when the New York Times reported by Rudy Giulianis Reiseplänen in Ukraine, who wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We are not interfering in an election, we are interfering in an investigation, which we have the right", he says the newspaper.
The attorney and former New York mayor seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that were fixed at Trump ’ s 2016 rival candidate: Hillary Clinton colluded with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia ’ s investigation in the US, but that charge was never taken seriously.
The Giulianis and the President are saying that the former Vice President and currently high-profile candidate for the Democratic presidential candidature, Joe Biden, have been the Ukrainian prime minister of the Obama administration to dismiss Ukraine ’ s governor Viktor Schokin ’ s dismissal of the then Ukrainian Prosecutor ’ s Attorney General, who was responsible for investigating the gas company, whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden worked.
In fact, when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General go, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected, and Schokin was also accused of being deeply corrupt, the US government was not the only Western partner to press his dismissal, and, incidentally, the Obama administration explicitly supported the investigation of the company.

Musk needs record to achieve his high goals, 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360 '000 to 400' 000 cars, which means that in the current and coming quarter of the six-digit numbers, most importantly the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low, despite the losses.
Will the British Government bypass Brexit?
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is complaining about whether he is looking for ways to bypass the last law adopted by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit; on a related question, he told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the Leave stermins until mid-October, unless an agreement with the EU is reached, Johnson criticises this as a "surrender law" which is creating negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to bypass the law; Johnson could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU withdrawal.
Johnson said he sought a treaty with the European Union. 'We are confident that the EU will leave on 31 October, and the best way is to reach an agreement.'
Iran seems to be experiencing uranium enrichment high
Iran ’ s president, Hassan Rohani, has stepped up the pressure on Europe ’ s contracting partners in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. ” Unfortunately, Europe ’ s states show an inability or unwillingness to take concrete action, ” said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the fringes of the UN General Assembly in New York. For the case that they were not committed to their promise, he “took further steps ” away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated 2015 agreement.
In the context of the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which included a commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations, the US stepped out of the agreement in 2018 to force Iran, with "maximum pressure", to change course in the Middle East policy deemed aggressive, and President Donald Trump ’ s administration wants to renegotiate a new deal with tougher conditions, and is now reintroducing tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently with a re-.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or, at least, preparing centrifuges installed at the beginning of September, and that, according to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 further centrifuges.
Perhaps Europeans are not prepared to bear their share of the deal, and so the Iranians, with the costs and the burden of stifling US sanctions alone, presumed Rouhani, will continue to talk, but hopefully come up with a solution.
Rouhani continues to denounce Iran ’ s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil facility in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom followed Monday ’ s US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, Iran supported Huthi rebels in Yemen to attack what the US, however, regarded as a false commitment. ” We have with that.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence," said Rohani, who would not have skilled the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN General Debate, but instead would have merely invoked the rebels in Yemen not being able to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the US administration ’ s far-reaching sanctions would have to be lifted, Rohani demanded that the government in Washington switch to a policy of “dialogue and reason. ”
Comet of Other Stern crosses the Solar System
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the deep outdoors of the world, which only once managed to capture other solar systems.
What was initially only a suspicion has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system, the from the depth, after on, with the interest of astronomin the. the,, the, the,,., the the
The furthest comet was discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo-Observatory on Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres diameter.
2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object detected during a flight of our solar system after 1I / 'Oumuamua of 2017.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get a glimpse of the solar system from the vicinity before it disappears on Nimmerwiedersehen.
According to the Komet analysis, on a so-called hyper orbit that leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) communicated, it is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies.
In contrast to 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in the first lug, leaving the researchers for months to study.' The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and will be visible until April 2020 with medium sized telescopes', explained Farnocchia. 'Afterwards it will until October 2020 with larger telescopes..
A few observatories have already targeted the visitor, such as a Karen Meech team from the University of Hawaii, who had already redirected the characterization of 1I / 'Oumuamua, in a first study the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers of the astrophysical institute of the Canaries (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar sweat, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles such of comets of our solar system, and that points to its composition must be similar," IAC researcher Julia de León.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open a new way to research certain processes in other solar systems, but how often such endangers are, is still difficult to estimate, but one of the next interstellar visitors could possibly catch a planned satellite mission from the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency wants to deploy the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" (German for example Kometen-Abfangjäger) from our own solar system, or to interstellar visitors such as 1I / 'Oumuamua, up to 2028, on a position in 1.5 million miles from.
First landing at Beijing ’ s New Mega-Airport Daxing
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the People ’ s Republic, the new mega-airport in the south of China is a first passenger aircraft of the United Airlines, a special honour for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers will be transported to the new airport each year, and 2025 will be 72 million, and China ’ s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project, the most recent China ’ s “” construction.
The complex has four runways, which will be extended to seven later, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system.
The first passenger machine was built after four years in Beijing.
New aircraft is to fly by 2030: four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - dreaming of the British Space Agency UK Space Agency to make this, for the 2030s flight in excess tempo, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) that the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire developed, quoted the US channel CNN the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely be implemented", said Agenturchef Graham Turnock the channel. "We speak of the 2030s years for the commissioning and work is already...... the the,, the,,,,,,,,,,,
The British Space Agency is working with the Australian Aerospace Agency, a flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis takes about 20 hours.

Washington turmoil: Trump wants to track anonymous Tippers in Ukraine ’ s affairs
In the Ukraine-affair about US President Donald Trump ’ s possible abuse of power, Trump wants to whiteness possible undead positions in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," said Trump to the staff of the United Nations envoy in New York on Thursday.
The event was not in fact public, but several US media broadcasted audio recordings on Friday of the address, while Democrats responded empresely to the President ’ s statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced on Tuesday preparations for an impeachment procedure against Trump, with accusations based mainly on a written complaint by an anonymous intelligence collaborator who charges heavy charges against Trump and his central government.
As part of his work, the whistleblowers want to have information from several government officials that the US president uses the power of his office to ensure that another country interferes with his favor in the US 2020 election.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate the political rivals of Joe Biden, dealing with former deals by Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his palaces from Ukraine ’ s judiciary.
The whistleblowers accused the White House of looking at the Ukraine-Telefonat also of cover-up: senior government officials would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling, as usual an electronic wordword protocol has been made, which was usually removed from the White House from a normally planned database and was instead stored in a particularly protected system, and so far only a rough discussion protocol has been published.
"New York Times" reported that it was a member of the CIA's secret service.
Trump once again challenged the credibility of the source on Friday, in a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that "whistleblowers" had disseminated information from second hand, which would have turned out to be untrue, so perhaps there were no tippers or spies.
As Trump said in New York about those who have provided whistleblowers with information, outrage arose, but the US House Chair, Nancy Pelosi, reacted alarmingly and complained that Trump ’ s statement once again undermined the government ’ s integrity.
For months now, the House of Representatives has been conducting various investigations in various committees against Trump and his environment, with Ukraine-style accusations now driving the Democrats forward with new anger to launch a possible impeachment against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the chief of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, accused him of misrepresentation of things, and again called for the resignation of the committee chairman, Trump, who had regularly and his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US government officials from the security and foreign policy area, most of whom worked under democratic, but also Republican presidents, made a statement in a “unscrupulous abuse of power ” issued on Friday that led to the Democrats ’ investigation into a possible impeachment procedure, and if the allegations were preserved, it would be“ an unscrupulous abuse of power ” by Trump.
There is no precise timetable for the next procedure, with the majority in the House of Representatives allowing the Democrats to make a so-called impeachment procedure, but the decision to actually dismiss it was made in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority, so the prospects for success in such a process have been low, so far no US president has been impeachment.
VW Works Council: Jobs are being dismantled 'creeping'.
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe, and this concern drives the company board of the automobile manufacturer, which wants to reduce its annual factory costs of EUR 10 billion by EUR 2023 by EUR 2 billion, of which EUR 500 million will be saved this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between companies and the works council foresees a reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from business councils, jobs in production that are not actually in a position to dispose of would be "creeping" over a different path - in other words, passing the official course, so vacant regular posts would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the works council has no means of forcing the re-occupation, and in many places it has now failed to take on board the work of staff who would be more concerned about a gradual blueprint of the vehicle ’ s plants, thereby increasing the fear that the vehicle production could be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world, and VW said it only: 'Adapting the employment volume is as socially acceptable along the demographic curve'.
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and centrally manage new projects, reducing costs and accelerating decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness.
On this path, there are already successes: for example, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year, while journalists said Tostmann that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, is to be reduced by 1.1 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg family plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. plants Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components.
As Tostmann announced last year, in Wolfsburg, "perspektivisch" is supposed to roll out a million cars from the band, which the of production, the production. the the of, the.,, the,, the,,. the, the. the the.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg, but the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan are declining, and so expectations for the Golf 8 are set to remain, despite all efforts to build e-mobility, despite the Brot-und-Butter-Auto of the Wolfsburger.
With Voodoo to prostitution forced: traffickers in human beings condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been hit by gays, taken to the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six presumed traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Nigerian women were forced into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution in order to impose their obedience on their families, who were forced to leave Nigerian lands before a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old, and they were taken over by Libyan smugglers in sludge boats over the Mediterranean, but the dream of a better future was not fulfilled, and in Germany, they were distributed across different brothels to cover the alleged sluice costs of an average of EUR 25 000, so the wage was taken away from them completely.
The two men and women who were accused - the one sluggish and the subsequent distribution of young Nigerians on brothels in the process. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult to create", said Richterin Isabel Hoffmann at the judgement announcement. "Some were....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The judgments are based on unimportant and unimportant provisions of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm Dauerstreit mit dem Lufthansa Group hat die Flugbegleitergewerkschaft Ufo erneut mit Streiks gedroht.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will be informed on 14 October about the industrial action in the LH Group, "Ufo-Tarifvorstand Daniel Flohr announced on Friday with Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have refused to negotiate with Ufo for months, including the question of whether the trade union has terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa legally.
On this point, Ufo sees himself strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court, and Lufthansa wanted to state that the collective agreements were not cancelled, and the Court rejected the amendments, confirming that the decision was taken and verifying that legal action should be taken.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted a request to the District Labour Court of Frankfurt to review Ufo ’ s status as a trade union, arguing that the trade union has not been a defensible board of directors for months, and that it is not in a position to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
As a result, many members of the board, including the former trade union leader Nicoley Baublies, resigned in late July due to doubts about their leadership about the strike of the cabin crew at Eurowings.
Releasing entry: Saudi Arabia announces a new visa regime.
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not just been known as an international tourist magnet, but that is now to change, and the country wants to introduce new visa rules on the Persian Gulf.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is an historic moment for our country," said the Chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
This article is an outline and needs more content.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones hit two of Saudi Arabia ’ s most important oil installations: the country ’ s largest oil refinery in Abkaik, and the oil field in Churais, with national oil production plummeting, oil price shocks soaring, and it is likely to take several weeks for Kingdom oil production to return to its old level.

Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction.
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging, and urban growth are the causes of the threat, the World Conservation Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels, investigating the stocks of all the 454 tree species known in Europe, 265 of which are nowhere else on the continent, 265 of which are 58% threatened, 66 of which are already at the highest level of risk and therefore are at risk of extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: "potentially endangered" by "endangered", "endangered", "threatened by extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct".
Eberesche and wild rosemary threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus), in particular, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German press agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are so small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
In addition to a mushroom, the Balkan miniature motte, which has spread from South-Eastern Europe over the whole continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies.
Strauchare and moose also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists produced new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moss, more than one-fifth of molluscs and moss, and nearly half of all ostriches are under threat, the IUCN, and this is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, to encapsulated species, agricultural practices and climate change.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. "We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority".

Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance.
Some banks are expected to pay a press release for Thomas Cook ’ s travel provider ’ s bankruptcy, threatening high write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans, including the Credit Suisse, writes the Financial Times in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit, and Credit Suisse would have to make a total of £1.8 billion (roughly €2 billion) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept write-downs of £900 million to £1 billion, and creditors between £550 and £825 million; indeed, the amounts to be deducted should be higher at the top of the bandwidth, said an expert on the sheet.
As the creditors' losses will actually be at the end of the insolvency proceedings, a person close to this process does not beat too much hope, for example, about 40 Thomas Cook aircraft in the UK are "old" and many of the real estate in bad locations.
Rackete is supposed to have brought alleged killers to Italy
The Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who have tortured and killed the people of Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we have no factual information about it," said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy, accused of raping, torturing, and killing in Libya, and accused the alleged perpetrators of being arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy.
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to Lampedusa ’ s port on 29 June, condemning a ship from the Italian financial police to the day that the three suspects arrived there, and the captains are being sent to investigate illegal immigration.
US Government Warning Huawei
The head of the US Internet Agency Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the federal government against entrusting Huawei to the Chinese network arm.
We believe that the risks are too big, "said Pai the" trading sheet "with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law," which each company "undertakes under Chinese jurisprudence to follow instructions from the security authorities.
The law in force prohibits the company from informing third parties about such requests, "said FCC CEO, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of confidence" from suppliers.
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" under appeal to own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not consist only of hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date, which software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, "said Pai.
It is very difficult to imagine "that a government authority," no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks ", says FCC head.
Huawei accuses the Chinese corporation of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque, and the employee company, supposedly owned by the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, "said Pai the" trading sheet ".
The US has recently been in Berlin to promote the US position.
Chemiefabrik in northern France is burning: schools closed.
A gigantic firewall illuminates the sky above a North French chemical factory, and the fire has been cleared after hours - the clean-up could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches remain closed in the region.
The Ministry of the Interior called on citizens to remain as far as possible in buildings and not to suspend smoking, and wounded farmers and breeders to protect their animals, and.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture told, and there was still a risk that after the extinguishing smell spread, the prefecture on Twitter, according to the prefecture, 240 fire fighters and 90 policemen and genomes were deployed.
The company Lubrizol is located just a few kilometres from the city centre.
The Normandy factory belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly supervised.
In the early 20th century, the city became a major center of the city.
In the early morning, the fire broke out at 02.40 a.m., the authorities reported that the cause remained unclear first, and Rouen is a regional metropolis, situated on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
The French economy and finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, "said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for next year.
The eurozone economy is weakening, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation becomes worse to take the necessary decisions'.
Actions would have to take account of those states that would have budgetary margins for more investment, said Le Maire, among others, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these margins, added the minister, and repudiated the country ’ s high level of public debt, which is more than 98% of GDP, with the French government ’ the need and.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy, and in return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government is thus reacting, among other things, to the protests of the Yellow West movement, which is expected to fall to 2.2%, to 3.1% this year.
Is he still tempted to trickle: Johnson is softening Brexit tactics?
The British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes the "Capitol Act" adopted by Parliament.
The parliament is back, a law prescribes to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaotic affair, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole, and that this possibility may be addressed, but Tory politicians evade it.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is complaining about whether he wants to impose an unregulated Brexit – despite the law passed by Parliament last year, which is intended to prevent it from happening. a question that Johnson with journalists.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the Leave stermins until mid-October no agreement with the EU will be reached; Johnson criticises this as a "surrender law" that is creating negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister, John Major, said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to bypass the law; the Premier could use a procedural trick that shifted the entry into force of the law to the post-EU withdrawal period; Johnson said that he had a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that the EU will leave on October 31, and the best way is to reach an agreement."
Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, said that he felt the political confrontations surrounding Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the desired exit from the EU will come about: "We enjoy that, we will win, we will (Anm. Red.: from the EU),,, no concern," said of the British newspaper.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 EU referendum, is now serving as chief strategist in the UK ’ s Downing Street government headquarters, hiding behind the uncompromising policy that has led the Premier into an awkward situation.

Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers, but it doesn't the great. the,,, the.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until her death in 1998, was visibly proud and led when he presented the picture band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, including Ringstar Stell, Mc,,,,, and,,.
After the Launch Event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "# ThePolaroidDiaries is a volatile view of the life of an exceptional family from the time before instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the instant magic of polaroid films".
Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, has always been the camera, and thousands of Polaroids have made it, some hundred of them are now published in The Polaroid Diaries.
There are portraits, stilllife, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s until the late 90s. "She real moments", writes the art Ekow Eshun, and again in: your man, as,,,,,, the,,..., the, the, the, the, the., the, the

"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from its neighboring country, despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a Friday interview that Turkey could not break off the oil and gas import from Iran.
We will continue to buy our gas from there, "said Erdogan in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
But Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, because some companies had withdrawn because of US threats.
Nevertheless, Turkey 's' particularly on this issue and on many other issues will continue our relations with Iran ', said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" vis-à-vis the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear deal with Iran. According to the US, Iran is pursuing a nuclear program in secret and does not respect the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran ’ s oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably in recent months.
The US Government wants to limit the admission of refugees
The US government wants to slash the admission of refugees, with the US State Department declaring on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, equivalent to a 40% cut.
The State Department declared that the US would remain committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task is to protect US citizens and serve them, and the US immigration system.
The US government wants to focus on receiving two refugee groups in the future: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who helped the US military in the country, who are at risk of being born of the State Department ’ s statement, while Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador are expected to receive a maximum of 1500 refugees.
In 1980, refugees from UN camps around the world were selected, and resettled in the US, with a ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the year 2020 as the lowest in the program ’ s history. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump ’ s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was close to 85,000.
The US would further damage its leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to limit immigration to the US, both legally and illegally, and the US government is expecting 350,000 asylum applications from its own claims for the coming budget year, which are separated from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Come a Spit Close"
US President Donald Trump has accused Hinweiser of whistleblower-case espionage, and anyone who has always attributed evidence to the informant who abuse power to him has said, "comes a nickel near," said Trump, according to a record of a private event in New York on Thursday.
As he was asked by the person who informed the whistleblowers about contentious events in the White House, he replied: "That comes a nickel close." Then added Trump: "Do you know what we did in old times when we were clever?
Observers noted a possible allusion to the death penalty, with Democrats strongly criticizing Trump ’ s statements and warning him of intimidation of witnesses; moreover, it was an attempt to impede a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment procedure against him, chaired by the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Secret Services, and Supervision at the House of Representatives.
The whistleblowers the president in a now published complaint that he has abused his post to seek interference from another country in the US 2020 election; specifically, his disputed telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump suggested to him that he should initiate investigations into his possible democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is not yet clear who is both the whistleblowers themselves and the informants of the whistleblowers, as reported by the New York Times, but the whistleblowers are an analyst of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat: Baby and infants drowned in Aegean.
There is a growing number of people trying to get to Greece via the Aegean Sea, often with too little boats, and seven migrants have died in a queue, including five children.
The Greek island of Chios has been killed during the sinking of a mud boat of seven migrants, including a baby and four other children, the Greek coastguard reported that four children, three women and five men were thus able to be rescued from the floods of the crew of a previous ferry.
In the morning, a smuggler reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr.
The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) 174 people have been killed by migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands of the east of the Aegean, mostly in far too small boats.

Rental suddenly discontinued: WeWork lets property markets tremble.
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from the small start-up to the driving force on the world ’ s most expensive real estate markets, but the company is now in crisis, and landlords need to fear billions of dollars.
The company was founded just a few days ago by Adam Neumann as head of the planned stock market move and started selling subsidiaries and values like the private jet for executives to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months, and also reported, among other things, the British Financial Times, "WeWork has stopped concluding new leases with immediate effect.
If you are looking for a new office space, please contact us.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded rental contracts with maturities of up to 15 years, with commitments of more than $40 billion, which could not only be a problem for the company itself and its investors, but also for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the last 24 months almost 300,000 square meters of office space.
In the British capital, too, the equilibrium in the real estate market could be felt without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the prime tenant, in a €100 million repurchased office building in the center of the financial metropolis that was built last year by the savings fund fund fund fund provider Deka.
Many landlords have converted their real estate for the requirements of WeWork with high investment, and if WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, real estate owners would probably have to write off some of the billions of dollars they had hoped for - already scarce reserves of WeWork, despite the long-term rental contracts, because the renting of individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by separate subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable in narrow confines.
Russia resumed numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coastguard has once again gone against North Korean fishermen and, in the last few days, a total of 262 poachers have been arrested who have illegally fished in the waters, according to the Russian National Intelligence Agency (FSB) on Friday, according to Interfax.
It was only ten days ago that 161 North Korea fishermen were arrested, the border guards were fired and three of them were injured, and this time there were no injuries, and the Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen have therefore travelled to Russian territorial waters, where the Russian coastguard claims that their marine biological resources have been patrolled, with 30,000 Tint Fish detected in the new controls, and three fishing and two motor boats confiscated and transported to Nachodka and Posjet to Vladivostok, and the Ria Nowosti agency found that the coastguard had committed more than 8,000 infringements overall in 2018.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued a fishing licence to the North Koreans even after the indigenous entrepreneurs were brought to Klagen, and thousands of North Korea fishermen have already been arrested in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who fished with mesh synthetic nets burned in Russia, who would also bring small creatures out of the sea, and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be dismantled, and the ships themselves would not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
In the case of the arrests in the week before, three members of the Russian Coastguard were injured according to Moscow, and another wounded North Koreans, according to the FSB, died later of injuries.
The United States imposed a ban on entry into exile President Castro
The United States has imposed a ban on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, and the US Department of Foreign Affairs has justified this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in 'gross human rights violations'.
As President of the Armed Forces, Fidel Castro's brother of the late Revolutionary Leader also met with the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, for human rights violations there. "The contempt for human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," the American Foreign Secretary Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump, on Wednesday, had issued a visa ban on other members of the Venezuelan government and the military, and in Venezuela, a fierce power struggle has been raging between the government and the opposition for months, with the US imposing a whole series of sanctions on Maduro ’ s government to force him to the knees and to force the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allies in Maduros, and the socialist Caribbean island receives oil in exchange for the services of seconded doctors.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people are again protesting for more climate protection on the streets today.
The climate change movement Fridays for Future is planning new actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world, starting with New Zealand and Australia, before the protests over Europe and North America, where climate activists Greta Thunrg wanted to take part in a large-scale demonstration in Canada ’ s Montreal.
This Friday, after the record turnout of the previous week, is relatively unclear, as Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, more than four million people stood up for the climate, and this Friday we will do it again!" she wrote on Twitter, so long as there were 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - about 1.4 million - had taken part in the protests after estimates of Fridays for Future in 575 German cities.
At the age of 15, Thunrg, in August 2018, had set himself before the Swedish Parliament to call on the politicians of their country to make greater efforts to protect the climate, and this has been achieved within a short period of time by the Fridays-for-Future movement.
Together, they are calling for more ambition in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe, especially in accordance with the Paris climate agreement, to curb global warming to less than 1.5 degrees relative to pre-industrial times.
Thunrg was present in New York just over a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic tear with a high-sea racing yacht, where she last attended climate protests and summits of the United Nations.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
In the future, the people of Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony, and this is a change in fire protection. 'This applies too,' said a spokesman for the Ministry of emergency in Moscow on Thursday, according to the Moscow, the ban.
If the cigarette is to ignite a fire, the penalty will be higher.
Beating Cyber Criminal Investigators
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time lifted a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
Altogether, 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former Nato-Bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel, via the internationally operating criminals.
This was the case with the General Prosecutor's office in Koblenz, where seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening at a major event, and the Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
In November 2016, according to the Public Prosecutor ’ s General Prosecutor, he steered a cyber bunker over a server.
A host of this kind has been hijacked for the first time in Germany, and a web hoster provides infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the case of the access auction with support of special units such as GSG9 there have been searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people today want to go to the streets again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate dispute week, the Fridays for Future movement planned further actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland in Sylt.
Climate protests  Who are actually Thunrgs Hintermänner?
In the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that are warming up the climate, is it all the more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl is keeping the mirror in front of the nose, yet what is behind it?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is putting the masses on the move and encouraging young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world, and, historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has created a collection of children and young people to win, as long ago as 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne had explored to work for a fairer world, when he was able to attract a lot of young people and to cross the sea to reach the promised land, similar to Greta Thunrg ’ s recent trip to America.
"We don't have time" to save the world, Greta Thunberg has PR-Manager with her mother, with daughter Ram.
This is where the spirits are now failing: is it morally right to enrich themselves financially with the savior of the world?
Comet discovered: Interstellarer guest crosses through our solar system.
A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The discourses of astronomers have confirmed themselves: a strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time, researchers have only guessed it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment.
2I / Borisov: Komet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea.
In 2371, the USS Enterprise-D was assigned to the USS Enterprise-D in the Delta Quadrant.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now, from the proximity of insights into a foreign solar system, similar to the commet of our system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canaries reports, the of the International Astronomical Union (IAC).
Komet was already sighted before Anflug - and can be observed several months ago.
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in depth, because unlike his predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in his infancy, which means that he can be studied for many months from Earth. "The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December, and will be visible until April 2020 with medium sized telescopes," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First discoveries about Komet 2I / Borisov arouse hopes in science. with the.
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter, but at the same time the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of silence is similar to ours.
The observation goes beyond individual knowledge, however, that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years, allowing for a new path to research certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids keep on occupying researchers, and only recently a giant asteroid came past the Earth and came close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson dismays over brother brother
He was born in London, England.
"Capitulation", "Fraud", "Contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to arm - at least verbally.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words like surrender, as if the opponents of leaving the EU were 'hanging, pulled, squeezed, burned, and squeezed', and it seems to me that this is extremely reprehensible, and you do not recognise the version of her brother, Rachel Johnson, who was in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit party 'Change UK'.
She was particularly keen that her brother, Jo Cox, referred to an EU friendly House of Commons, murdered a few days before the 2016 Leave referendum by a neo-Nazi, who said that the best way to pay homage to the memory of Deren was to go through Brexit, Boris Johnson in the House of Commons, "It is very distasteful to refer to a Member who was murdered by someone who called Britain first 'Britain,' Johnson's sister, and the perpetrator obviously came from the far right camp, which was' reinforced by this kind of language '.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even Mr Cox's widow criticised the Prime Minister, 'I am sick when Jo's name is being used', he tweeted: the best way to honour her is, if and determined, which - no matter what you think - but never to demonise the other side ', he also complained that an atmosphere has been in which attacks have become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and resigned as a Tory MP. "I was torn apart over the past few months between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is an insoluble tension," Jo Johnson argued.
John ’ s language was also strongly criticized in the Church, as the Times reports, criticizes all 118 bishops and Archbishops of the Church of England who said that this country was not worthy.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez join the Super Bowl.
The NFL sets a strong mark in the year of its 100-year existence: In the semi-time of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots are on the promise of an explosion of fun and energy.
Latina-Power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the semi-time on Thursday (local time) at the upcoming finals of the US Football League NFL.
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent alongside JLo the Latino community, because this has an incredible strength in the USA," said Shakira in a video.
The Final of the American Football League, which is celebrating its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2nd in Miami.
"I love that the Super Bowl this time two women on stage - and two Latinas", Lopez explained.
She was born in New York, after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico, and in the 2000s she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud", and later released songs in Spanish.
Shakira was known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer.
As we all know, the mid-term passenger is eagerly awaited every time in the United States, and this year, many consider the choice to be a political gesture; after all, the country, not least through President Donald Trump ’ s immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and also a gigantic advertising spectacle.
In the last year, political controversy arose in the run-up to the conflict over the Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to protest against police violence against blacks, had stepped up at the national anthem and, among other things, had been harshly approached by US President Donald Trump.
An actor and Youtuber sets Egypt ’ s ruler: Mohamed Ali prefers to remain abroad.
The two men who have had influence over the streets of Egypt have fled again, both of whom have spent the past week abroad, and one of the two floated at Cairo Airport on Friday, a President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly, the ex-general who spent the Muslim Brotherhood of Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected leader of the country, who had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had spent Sisis ’ s actions against political Islam, and had no silly human rights violations at Nil – in a week when the security forces killed hundreds of people in Egypt because they had warned against the president.
In the wake of President Mohamed Ali ’ s belief that the current events are taking place on the streets, Mohamed Ali naturally remained abroad, where he was deprived of access to the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egypt ’ s soil.
He goes directly to the head of state and in a very rustic language, while the people are starving, the President is hovering in the luxury, building magnificent new palaces, that is to say, because the army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment, and because in his second profession, as a builder, he has been doing business for 15 years with these very gentlemen, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - that, at least, is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding clicks show.
After thousands of people protested against his rule for the first time this week, and almost 2000 citizens, including prominent figures from civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million-march" for this Friday, and the fact that so many people would venture onto the streets was unlikely, but there were some small protests, such as in Giseh near Kairo and in Kina at Luxor videos in social media, whose participants called Al-Sisi for corruption and his departure.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where protesters last week saw banners burned with the president's portrait in pieces, was reported on Friday a massive police presence. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and on the streets of Ausfallstraßen.
Mohamed Ali has taken these precautions to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrirplatz," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let us not meet with police officers." As a, he: Egypt.
When the Provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection is running much slower than the provider, there are several test possibilities.
If you sign an Internet contract, you don ’ t need to trust the vendor ’ s speed data blindly; customers can check for yourself when they find something that is actually achieved.
Finally, the promised transfer rates are a part of the Treaty and should therefore also be achieved, explains Bavaria's central consumer centre.
If the connection is always much slower than the provider, there are various test possibilities, so the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) compare the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to bidder specific specifications and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated", gives consumers central Bavaria on their side to consider.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of time for the supplier to produce the promised service within 14 days, which is best done in writing by dial-up letters.
If the customer does not act according to multiple requests, the customer can cancel the contract and, under certain circumstances, demand compensation for damages, the success.
The Republican Revival
As the first senior Republican, Governor of Vermont has advocated an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that is being carried out here is determined by the facts that are found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, for Trump has been watching the bidder for years.
Republicans have so far withstood criticism of Trump for whistle-blown affair; few have discerned unease, and Scott ’ s statements are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already opposed Trump ’ s policies on several occasions, such as the easing of environmental rules and the tightening of immigration rules.
Spider-Man is still planned in the MCU: Further Marvel Film
It was a shock for all Spider-Man-Fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man gets after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spideys is continuing in the MCU, and I and all at the Marvel Studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it...

But how is the sudden good news coming?
So dip Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry in "Suits" -Finale on the Suits.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the United States in the big finale, with many happy endings and many cameo appearances, as well as the royals couple Prinz Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who have been involved in the series for many years, being charmin,.
One way: Duchess Meghan did not return to the final for a final gruss as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes, but instead showed some insights once again the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess, such as the moments of failed and happy wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his depressed sentence.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the "Suits" -Finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just went to Altar to marry his Verlobte Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) made a telling comment about his suit, whether he really wants to have a walking rock overthrown, the dirty Harvey from the Brtigtigam, just to make a snippish note: "Louis, you're not the prince of England.
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accidents
In the case of a refugee boat in the Aegean, a baby and four more children are drowned, and, overall, seven people died in the accident, such as the Greek coastguard on Friday.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland, and four children, three women and five men were.
At the moment, hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean have been killed over the past year on this route according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), which has announced that 174 people will be killed.
Together with his French colleague and the competent EU Commissioner, he wants to inform himself in Turkey about the situation of refugees, "Seehofer said on Friday, and then he wants to learn more about the" administrative problems of the Greeks "in Athens in order to help overcome them.
A spokesman for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday the planned trip of Seehofers with the EU Home Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France ’ s interior minister, Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusually large number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive; on Tuesday alone, 654 people fled to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said Wednesday.
Does the Turkey-Deal still work?
The increased figures cast doubt on the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who illegally come to the Greek islands via Turkey, and in exchange, the EU wanted to receive a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each Syrian refugee.
This article is about the migration of migrants to Lesbos, Chios, Sam, Le, and Kos harren.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never since the EU ’ s Turkey-refugee pact entered into force in March 2016, have so many been reported to have been public broadcasting.

Green politician must answer for embarrassing photo pans.
The leader of the Canadian Green Party, Elizabeth May, was manipulated for this reason by the Becher?
The Canadian Green boss is holding a multi-way brick in a photo, but it has now come out: the mug has been manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - It has remained quite unnoticed for a long time - and eventually dropped, but the reusable coffee maker with metal strohhalm, Elizabeth May, the boss of the Canadian Greens, never kept in his hand, and on the website of the party, she was on a photo with this mug to see, in conversation with citizens, but the photo had already been published and also spread to the media - and there was the Becher still a snowboarder (Papp) Becher, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss has to answer for photo pans.
The National Post then threw May into manipulation, and that the fake news party produced to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection", and that in the midst of an election campaign for the Unterhausen election, in which Trudeau, too, has become increasingly difficult due to a bribery scandal.
The photograph went to the social media viral and multiplied the discussion about fake news.
May showed himself shocked and adventured on her blog, of this action nothing dared to have.
May writes it does her suffering for the staff who have done so. "I don't want to describe him as stupid, but there was nothing to hide", she says to the Guardian and at the same time inherited something from her committed team: "If they want to edit an image, they could not make it with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens, too, have been torn down because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel in shitstorms - but their pictures were not filmed.
Influencerin wants to upgrade free: longevity flight ban at Cathay y...............
She was told that Jaqueline Ng had been promised an upgrade by Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for check-in she was not allowed on board - and she should never fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneous upgrades for Business Class - many of them flying - sometimes they are lucky and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class free of charge.
This case, however, shows how one should not do it: a self-proclaimed influenza cerin has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade, followed by Jaqueline Ng on more than 65,000 users on May 30, she returned from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the flight, the Jaqueline staff refused to upgrade, even though they presented an email suggesting that their Cathay Pacific allegedly had an upgrade, and the letter wanted to receive the influenza cerin from a marketing employee at the airline, while the airline accused Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
In the early 1990s, the FK became a member of the FK, and the FK became a member of the FK.
The airline staff at Jaquelines Airport and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific, for $1,400 (around €1,280) they had to buy a new airline ticket to Taiwan.
In her case, the influenza cerin Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, had paid the price for its original ticket, but also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influenza cerin has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights, and the Airline ’ s terms and conditions also state that this must not pay the new flight.
Oil prices after the ceasefire report in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon, and last cost a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea resorts Brent 61.83 U.S. dollars - about 1.4% less than the previous day.
He triggered a report by Wall Street Journals on a ceasefire in Yemen, and Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil facilities in mid-September had brought five% of world oil production to a halt, with the Huthi rebels allied with Iran in Yemen ’ s civil war fighting the attacks on them. Saudi Arabia, like the US administration, is blaming Iran, and a cease-fire would defuse the region ’ s political tension.
If an agreement is actually reached, we can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the raw material strategy department at Saxo Bank of the news agency Bloomberg.
The price of oil continues its downward trend over the past few days, with a week ago a barrel of WTI oil cost nearly $59, Brent nearly $65.
Last year, Bloomberg reported, citing insiders, that repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was faster than expected after the mid-September attack, with production again reaching a volume of eight million barrels a day and moving again toward the original quantity.
Last but not least, there have been several press reports in response to insiders reporting the rapid progress made by Saudi Aramco ’ s state-owned oil company in repairs, but commodity experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock market decline and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recently issued release on the way to leave the port.
But the US has announced that it will shift its defenses and soldiers to Iran ’ s arch-enemy to Saudi Arabia. The fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom had driven up oil prices significantly in recent weeks.
Proposals against Trump Wor
In the case of US President Donald Trump ’ s possible abuse of power, cover-up charges against the White House have become loud, with several leading government officials working hard to prevent a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July from accessing the vocabulary of the interview, an anonymous signatory.
North Korea ’ s Third Summit of Trump and Kim is dubious
North Korea has raised doubts that it will soon be a third summit of leaders, Kim Jong-un, and US President Donald Trump, and the sense and success prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of a lack of progress in implementing the agreements of the first summit in Singapore, led by Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the CNA Agency.
The US would have done nothing to implement the summit ’ s decisions last year, the North Korean State Department ’ s adviser said, and he also criticized tighter US sanctions and the joint US and South Korea military exercises, but he hopes to make a wise and courageous decision to bring it closer again.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he made a statement about disarmament of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program since Trump ’ s failed second summit and Kim ’ s failure in Hanoi in February. In June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states, and agreed to revive the talks, but so far without much success.

Pound Under Pressure - Savings Reduction
British Pound under Pressure
In the face of a swift reduction in interest rates, the pound loses value against the euro.
Frankfurt Speculation on an early interest rate reduction of the Bank of England (BoE) is the pound sterling.
In the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, and the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, and the United States.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy by the Brexit hickhack, without signaling a direct cut in interest rates, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country, if necessary, without a divorce agreement on 31 October.

Doping: Other Russian manipulation proved.
Material from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, a former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today ’ s Integrity Chief of the Light athletic World Federation.
On the occasion of the Easy-athletics World Cup, new details on the doping scandal in Russia are coming to light - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year, and also only gradually.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport was revealed, and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) blocked it for three years.
Positive findings are missing
In the following September, the Wada called on the Rusada Bann again, but called for access to the laboratory and said samples.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory have been manipulated.
The World Cup Not concerned
This confirms the IAAF ’ s stance: The Association of Light athletics holds the only organization in the Bann of Russia, and the World Cup in Doha marks the start of 30 Russian athletes flying neutral flags, proving that they are training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already taken place in the room and called on Russia to respond within three weeks to the accusations, and Russia is now threatening the renewed freeze of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
