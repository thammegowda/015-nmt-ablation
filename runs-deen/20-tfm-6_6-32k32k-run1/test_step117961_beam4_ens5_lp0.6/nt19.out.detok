Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchnerin" -candidates are shooting with People-Photographer Tuan and defy wind, gout and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shoot is in the video:
Grindel, the DFB ’ s Director, sees no basis for Özil ’ s comeback.
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question which of course depends on getting into contact, and also on talking to him about why he apparently felt this or that in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmower" of the "Bild Zeitung.
Despite months of debate over Özil ’ s photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of Özil, a 92 times national player.
"I would have liked Mesut Özil to continue playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case, "Grindel said.
De 29 years old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and justified him on the grounds that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared to talk to the German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up pressure, but he knows it from football in such a way that when "you leave a team or change an association, you talk about it with your trainer and I think it is a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden Hut in Schrebergarten Settlement burned
At 2.13 p.m. the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angerhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schreberg arten settlement, danger was behind schedule.
The professional fire brigade went out and found the hut in full fire at the time of arrival.
The roof had to be virtually completely removed and fire debris removed to the extent that was absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning hut, he had put a battery to store at noon.
That may be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be identified, as does the cause of the fire.
It should be considerable, however, because the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry Mother opposes: Lindsay Lohan attacks the family of refugees on the streets.
What has only led Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to take away children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") was herself on a live tour as she apparently wants to take away the children from a family in Moscow.
The US portal "TMZ" reports this and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan.
The clip shows how Lohan leaves a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have identified as a family of refugees from Syria.
When the family literally escapes from the actress, Lohan persecutes the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of selling children.
For all this she does not provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this just", Lohan is listening to the video as she follows the family along the road.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she is turning around and Lohan is missing a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress declares how shocked she is - and she keeps the cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid.
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The Lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: The number of deaths on Sulawesi is rising to more than 400.
Following the severe earthquake of 7.5 magnitude and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths have been reported.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the areas devastated and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigned as Tesla ’ s Board Chairman
At the beginning was a tweet.
At the beginning of August, Tesla ’ s CEO Elon Musk caused stock markets to disarm when he announced a withdrawal of the electric supercar.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have come to an agreement.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and Tesla ’ s CEO is withdrawing from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain CEO.
British Conservative Party Congress
The Tories' Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party ’ s convention is supposed to address foreign policy, trade, and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the hard-line Brexiteers, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new State Name
Macedonia ’ s Foreign Ministers (right) and Greece have already agreed.
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about this name doubling for years.
Now they have come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in future and this Sunday the people will vote on it - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meant Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil ’ s presidential election, the country ’ s mood is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is therefore ahead of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the left Workers ’ Party.
Audi: Dieselgate processing takes longer than planned.
"The Diesel task force is still there," said Development Director Peter Mertens to the industry magazine "Automobilwoche".
Rupert Stadler, the jailed and trusted Audi CEO, announced in December 2017 that the task force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all engine / gearbox combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler ’ s future on Friday and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values after the exhaust fraud became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At present, Bram Schol is Head of Sales as Commissioner.
Due to the change to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, production losses at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronner Vote".
Basically, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already had 15,000 reservations.
Grindel aspires to re-election - Lahm is to the DFB Bureau.
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for the position of DFB president again despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as possible," said Grindel as a guest on Sunday morning at the "Aktuelle Sportshodio" of the ZDF.
Time and again we have to seek re-election, which I shall do.
And then you have to look at whether the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it 'strange' if, after winning the European Football Championship in 2024, he did not 'want to work on the project for the future'.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been head of the association as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, overthrown by the summer fairytale affair.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, Philipp Lahm, the future head of the European Parliament, is to work with the DFB Presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to advise the Bureau in this role and will of course be warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan ’ s photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migrant background should become DFB integration ambassador.
Currently, this office is run by native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person without a migrant background has a clear influence on society and football and says," the issue is important, we have to take care of it ", this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration must work," Grindel said.
Taking Down with Half-wise Balance
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat part.
It can also display muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the sausages.
Does he say nothing about whether I have replaced fat with muscles?
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear hits for Berlin and Oldenburg.
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started with a clear victory in the new season of the Bundesliga.
For Science City Jena, the vice-champion won 112: 55 (52: 31) and offered a convincing match for more than 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berlin with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 meters), committed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators during his mandatory play debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of Trainer Ainars Bagatski with 84: 80 (39: 37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was with 24 points the best shooter at the guests.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 counters.
Last year's Playoff semi-finalist MHP Giant Ludwigsburg defeated the Frankfurt Fraport Skyliners at 83: 76 (41: 34).
With 24 points, Karim Jallow was the top scorer in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
For the Löwen Braunschweig basketball there was a clear 100: 64 (48: 30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings surprised the Oldenburg with 25 meters.
The Braunschweig, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been a majority shareholder since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26: 1 race of the Basket quickly created clear conditions.
Erdoğan Opened Mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with, among others, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his three-day visit to the country.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite followers of the Gülen movement living in Germany and take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow PKK or Gülen movement sympathizers to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
The city centre of Cologne was partially closed for the opening of the Ditib Mosque.
Several thousand police officers were deployed - including snipers.
The Ditib Islamic Association is in criticism because it is considered to be an extension of the Turkish Government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Schreckseconde
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes, and Cardi B have promoted greater commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in Central Park in New York.
"Get involved wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival during the night to Sunday in front of some 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I am nervous, I sweat, but it is okay, because I am here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid agencies, also took part in the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a second of horror when many spectators felt that the noise of a metal barrier was shooting, becoming frightened and trying to escape.
In short, panic arose, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musicians Chris Martin then calmed people off the stage.
"Nobody is trying to injure anyone," Martin said.
You are all in safety.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available as every year for free on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to get one had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - Buhrufe, on the other hand, for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, in the Senate Judicial Committee, Flake pronounced himself in favour of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, thereby alienating many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women who, according to their own data, had themselves experienced sexual assaults, confronted him in a lift on the way to committee meeting.
"You can also meet me at any time in an elevator," said Flake at the New York concert.
Press freedom: German government defends.
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert defended the ouster of a journalist at the press conference of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and went to the front row.
The t-shirt, was not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a question of disturbing the running of the press conference.
The action of the journalist caused a great deal of unrest, which is unacceptable.
That is why he has led people to get the man out.
Seibert said that it is not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely irrespective of whether this is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or of supporting or joining banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
Turkey ’ s leaders blame the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities either: the Austrian journalist Max Zirnguest was arrested only in early September.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
They were free and able to return to Germany, but there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and good as Florian David Fitz.
We have to look at this twice: yes, that really is Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - Die vom NDR produzierte Talkshow "Inas Nacht" ist für damit freiwillige Gespräche an der Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten" bekannt.
Host Ina Müller and her guests meet up with some beer, some wine or even more important drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities drink courage even for the obligatory vocal inserts.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: actor Florian David Fitz is famous for films such as "Men's Heart", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Best Day".
However, the trip to the far north of Munich did not get very good.
On Saturday he posted a Selfie - his face is completely broken on it, his eyes are only two small slits.
The bed elfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he only has a powerful hangover.
To his fans he posted some - probably not very serious - insights he has now gained: "Rule one: NIE goes to Ines night.
Rule two: never drinks the black sauce.
And syringe.
And the round of eggshells, which Ina tastes by half three, also leaves..
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted some tips to combat the aftershocks.
They ranged from instant brooch, fish brooch, or, probably the most effective, headache pills.
Others simply amused themselves by the sight of the usually attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nightly sucking party is unknown.
Since she has been hosting the TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa Fights with Vandalism and Treysa
The entrance to the 36 km railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired.
Recipes of rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shears, cigarette dumps, garbage and rubbish, demolished dustbins and now dismantled signposts - this is the way to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa.
For the flagship railway cycle track in the Rotkäppchenland a more than disgraceful sight.
Members of the ADFC village group Schwalmstadt have been working on the subject for a long time, however, according to the city ’ s cycling officer Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The issue has already been raised in the cycling board.
There is no solution.
The proposals range from laying the seating group to regularly removing waste containers and cleaning areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says desert havoc.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the local advisory board.
It is not only the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the group of seats is a regular meeting place for celebrations at weekends.
Not only do things go out loud, but the gelages are also destroyed: posts are torn out of the ground, garbage bins are demolished, signs are kneaded, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
You are annoyed that the resting place at the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for the birds of prey.
"Along the entire cycle path there is a clear focus here on the Haaße hill", confirms the cyclist representative, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be quite expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this will raise the threshold to encroach on the common good.
However, this would require a police force to pass a police force in time.
In general, deserts want to see a development of the Hasse hill.
It must be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path so far can be very satisfied.
Tourist marketing is still open to further development.
Our cycling path is of high quality compared to others in Germany ", says the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa as a very critical danger.
There is no bending on the Haaße hill.
In the case of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flow on both sides, "she explains.
That would not be a problem for sportsmen, but it would be a problem for the elderly and, in particular, for children.
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake.
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in collaboration.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music Contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family get-together with coffee and cake from the official official office of the Cultural Station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the great ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sterndyen", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwickies.
This contest, according to district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What did the text relate to?
In the villages Hiltruper See and Marktallee were mentioned very often.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his striking song to the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural railway station has also been acknowledged.
Time and again it was about experiencing coexistence in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short break with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about their work.
This was how Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
Frank was informed by sound engineer Stefan Schemelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest.
Meanwhile, Alvin Jasic has placed a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about profits," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury ’ s favourites – so that others can also listen to their songs.
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two teachers of guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children appeared again at the final - and even sounded "really good", as Franke said, without electronic support.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, uniqueness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westfälischen Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund and Jan Kaven, chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The Urban Offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She regarded the event as a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The Game of Word: Decrypto in the Game Test
The players form two teams that are sitting opposite each other.
There is a visual umbrella for each page, four cards with keywords, which you can decipher when you put them in - the old trick with the slide.
This ensures that the other side can read nothing by mistake.
On the cards, for example, read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Window.
3.
4. Fest '.
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
For here we should not guess the terms, but codes.
The encryption is alternately one player per team.
He gets a code card which may contain "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" you should not guess the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice", "feast" and "windows" - in such a way that his own team will recognize the correct order and the opposing team will not be able to do so, because that is what the game wins if it succeeds twice in cracking the code.
So the cipher writes and reads aloud: "throwing" for the dice, "lots" as a contrast to festival; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he was careful in school and knows the fall of the windows there.
This is the way round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can better summarize them with any reference that the encryption gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, the characters should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic of "decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it for quite long and long until they can finally play.
The explanatory video under decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you have got started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this incredible game.
But "decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre primus "codenames", which also puts an agency theme on a game of few words but is much better to play in small groups.
And to whom it is only a matter of rats and not a matter of victory points, it is also easy to invent one version for two.
Kulmbach: Man zeigt Polizei Hitlergruß und harten Gäste in der Kneipe.
A 48-year-old man employed the police officer Kulmbach twice on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed Hitler's greeting in the Upper City of a police force passing by, then later he also fell in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspectorate Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must also be prosecuted for using signs of unconstitutional organisations.
Pressig ’ s Works Works Works Home
The railway plant in Prestig was the hub of the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers cracked buffers, they heard it in a very pressing manner," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the town and the railway station.
That did not inspire anyone.
There, the brakes soar and the wagons cracked.
That was pure railway.
Speeches that symbolically represent Dinkel ’ s homeland of Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railways.
Here was the starting point for the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which after an increase of about 220 metres has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, trains and thrust blocks were needed in the past, which had their home in Prestig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Parliament approved the construction of a railway station with 21 locomotives, a training-station, a train station and a railway station.
"The centerpiece was the hub, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railway engineer for 47 years.
From the railway plant (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehsten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalb were also operated.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Ellaks were stationed in Prestig.
The electrification of the track in 1939 already minimized the need for drawers and drawers.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10 000 weighing was still placed in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were cut off, and in 1991 the rest was cut off.
Heidrich: 'It is regrettable that we have not envisaged better use of the site, including in the area of freight transport'.
On Whitsun 1989, the Nürnberg railway management celebrated the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nürnberg - Saalfeld" a pompous train station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Not long after the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were taken away, the shunting station of Pressig was history.....,, and.
"The Rangers and Hemmings did the most difficult work in rail transport," says Dinkel.
Any failure would have had fatal consequences.
Why the railway station of Prestig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round in the tennis tournament in Beijing, just like Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6: 2, 6: 2 against the French woman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the third world ranking list is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund führte 6: 3, 4: 2 gegen Darja Kassatkina, als die an Number 13 gesetzte Russin aufgab.
The Schwaebin is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
During the series "Art and Pleasure" a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelenbach.
With great relief registered organisers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special opening ceremony "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the premises of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelfrehnbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Around the Walberla" in the "Art and Pleasure" series.
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition demonstrated a great interest in the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be seen in Mittelhonnbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprising but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in tried and tested young hands with good prospects for the future.
In the past, both have been actively involved in the selection of artists and have helped to design flyers.
This year, too, there is another 70-cent special belt designed for art & pleasure, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high approval of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nürnberg was able to be won for the musical environment.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "Windplay Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with coloured accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" awaits the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightly coloured, playful with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes.
With the sun blowing through the bushwerk in the background, the object looks fairytale and invites you to linger.
Barbara Washneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to dedicate himself to the event 15 years K & G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
On the half way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "Der Wind das Himmerlichche Kind".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy building made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windplay Performance" for the softening through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate their 50th birthday.
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachten also gave air to their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They simply did not want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more Sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they launched the MGV 68 Albachten.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It will be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holsteige, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Their jubilee was the anniversary of the foundation.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
The traditional festival was back in time for the 50th anniversary.

It was a good occasion to hear cheerful songs.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee.
The climber marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really well placed in league three.
No trace of Sheu or Frackshausen, the independents do their thing.
And that's good at 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city competitor BW Aasee.
"This was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied '; on the contrary.
In the evening, Ronja de Boer ’ s birthday party was a good time for the game.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set the guests had a satzball.
"When they get the goal in, such a game can tilt," Büring knows from years of experience.
After all, the USC, with its sophisticated forces, made everything clear and set the goal of full yield.
"We all know who is on the other side of a Derby.
That is not breaking our grasp.
I saw really good volleyball in stages ", Annacker did not hate the 0: 3 - and went straight to the agenda.
It seems impossible to predict where the Independent will go after just three days of playing.
"It is simply too early for this," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball ", but they don't want to look down to the fourth league anyway.
If the West is not grubbed up in the coming weeks, they will have to look up..
However, an initial balance sheet can only be drawn up after ten or eleven matches.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will be in Essen on 14 October.

Her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband.
On the "Dream Ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series might have been complicit in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went off for ever.
The series that made her star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"This could also have been a reason.
Because I was grown up with this work, travelled with a suitcase alone around the world and many colleagues I admired saw me on equal terms ", tells Keller in conversation with the" picture on Sunday ".
First she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
For now, the journalists only shouted at Heide Keller.
"I do not know whether he liked it so well".
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been envious, but "like many men, Hans was afraid to talk about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried to be "the only right person for Hans von Borsody" and he wanted to know my fears, my weaknesses.
In other words, in plain English: I have withstood ', as she says.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which in reality I never was, even though I sometimes appeared naughty and courageous on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever ".
After a marriage to Thomas Härtner that had already failed before, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong again".
The day before the civil ceremony, I sat in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
In 2372, he was assigned to the USS Enterprise-D.
Why it never worked with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller presented his love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively ".
The Nightfalter, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city at the NZZ resort of Zurich, has dared the ZFF-Opening Party this time.
Our fold is not a moth, but a little light shy.
And the glow in which a green carpet is dug on the Sechseläutenplatz is dazzling it too much.
But it's a film festival, more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday night he torches over the square to make himself easy in the "Aquaclean-WC Oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet facility, sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival. The needful establishment on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a great effort to create a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, the men ’ s oasis stinks to the sky for some reason.
So get out here, go over the other side of the street: Geladene guests who have just had the best level of entertainment in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book" celebrate as every year the festival spirit with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as you know, the shown works come from all over the world.
What do you not need to think about an article about this festival in order not to fall into secret advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The Falter binds himself a tie around the Fühler, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully doorstewards actually fill him generously.
Inside, the geladens push themselves, dance far after midnight to live music, or let DJ beat each other ’ s rhythms, and rinse down exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
At the delicatessenladen in the souterrain, oysters are waiting for sizzling mouths, next to the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is bubbling.
And the hammer is: all the shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folds study the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If the two are separate instructions, he has lost himself in the dress code.
But it is more a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the houseware-department on the upper floor the poultry dumps a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", in accordance with the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily get the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been campaigning for that brand for years, is not here the evening either.
However, between local celebrities, cash desks and kitchen articles, a face that is known to the observer is passing: Peter Farrell, director of the opening film.
His main character should not be far away.
And really: Right now Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd with soon sixty acting almost like a choral boy.
It is not being squabbled, it is not being paid for, it is at best being stealthed.
It is precisely for this reticence that international stars love this film festival, often misunderstood.
Maradona celebrates Mexico ’ s Victory with Cumbia Dances
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina ’ s football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2: 0 victory by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57 year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as shown in a video already published on Saturday.

Handball: League of Associations 1: ASV Sending to last-minute default "Destroyed on the ground"
Swen Biedeki, Coach of the Handball Association Association ASV Senden, could hardly believe: "Such a bitter defeat".
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we have totally sleeped", the ASV trainer got annoyed.
The owners of the house quickly ran at 8: 1, even the early days that Bienahki had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team", Bieveki summarized the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the delay was only two goals.
Especially Senders Bester, Marius Hintz, met at the stage one by one.
After the change it became even better from a visitor ’ s point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst compared to 15: 15, after which the baton changer almost ran throughout.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three matches (29: 26).
And then?
Griff the non-partisan into the event.
Biegeleki is usually wary of blaming others.
But: The 120-second penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received was "a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and met four times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood up against seven men at the back, and repeatedly thrown on the empty goal.
But they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now it has to be a damned victory", says the completely operated Biedeki.
ASV Doors: Hintz (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Missing women for 30 years - Police digging corpses
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (district court), the police are looking for the mortal remains of the woman.
On Saturday, forces set up a road at Marxgrün.
The road surface and several layers of it were removed, as the police and the public prosecutor jointly announced.
According to new evidence, the missing person may have been buried not far from their place of residence.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime.
Since last year, the criminal police court, together with the public prosecutor's office, has, according to the data, been working intensively on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian monument protection authority, the investigators found a conspicuous presence under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials confined the place to a few metres.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.

In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm equipping computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatened dismissal as head of the billionaire company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought a non-judicial lawsuit on misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk also relinquishes the office of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German chairman of the supervisory board.
He may remain on the board.
Neither Musk nor Tesla accepted misconduct in the comparison that has yet to be confirmed by a court.
The SEC had sued the world ’ s famous manager at the US federal court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk Is Not Debting
Musk declared that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, and that funding was secured.
That would have put Tesla at a total of $72 billion.
Later Musk rubed back: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an external chairman, hire two independent board members, and set up a committee to monitor Musk ’ s communications.

Surveys: 46% Do not want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
After the squabbles of the past few weeks, GroKo receives a number of surveys.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey – Angela Merkel is being viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD first overtook the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday nationwide.
In the opinion research institute ’ s weekly poll, the AfD places one counter at 17%, the SPD scores one point compared to the previous week, and lands at 16%.
The CDU and CSU are also losing a counter and only reaching 27%.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens reach 15%, the left 11%, and the FDP 10%.
According to Emnid, if a federal election were held on Sunday, the governing parties of the SPD, the CDU, and the CSU would together receive only 43% of the vote.
This means that the grand coalition has now lost the majority on the Sunday issue in all the major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
Together, they received 53.4% in the 2017 federal election.
The other parties also have a wide range: the AfD, the second-largest party in several polls, is 15-18%.
The Greens reach 12.5% to 17%.

According to the survey, only one in two (50 per cent) wants the grand coalition to hold a three-year general election by the next regular federal election, with 41 per cent in favour of a new election.
In another poll published on Saturday, Merkel ’ s approval ratings were clear.
Divided Germans also judge whether Merkel should run again for the CDU ’ s presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, while 44 percent are against.
As a result, 64% of EU supporters want to stand for election, 35% do not.
Aldi ’ s Disconnect to Love
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Those who say that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintances - they should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" through Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romanticism as a place of acquaintance for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxershort bargains at the Wühltisch or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the grandchildren later than a mere swip to the right.
The App Tinder is reputed to be not so much a contact exchange, but rather a slippery exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react when they do not talk about the bush in the first message?
This is the amazing result.
Normal Hollywood Lovestory potential comes when love happiness is preceded by a lost and repeated run.
If the guy then also reports to his pet at the e-mail address Bio-putenfleb @ gmx.de, then that sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and his friends - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this Annonce in an aldi branch unknown to us can certainly hope that she will find her dream man, with whom she had a short talk about "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
In order to believe in the magic of analogue learning, she certainly deserves her happy end à la Hollywood.

Football: Reus and Zorc call for calm for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about the shape and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That is not good for the boy.

Football: The Eberl: No Hurriot in Hearcking Contract Talks

Football: District League: Researchers appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrhein braves.
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch and his sons went to court.
He was the coach of the football division VfL Wolbeck, who withdrew from the pitch in order to reflect on the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.
Taurischer Hersteller ist das 1: 1 am Sonntag gegen die SC Altenrhein, im letzten Spielzeit nur heute weniger am Rist gebracht.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We have made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen ", Fetsch praised his guys and searched each individual for the match, simply to say" thank you "for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his death (17), who switched in Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38) missed the lead.
It would almost have come to pass when the SCA, in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer, shot up dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box in minute 41 - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a return to Thewes..............
With the objection of Miles Geske, fetsch on the left side missed another fresh cell cure.
When Altenrhein Chris Naberbäumer hit in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect blow for the placeholders 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The fiddle himself appeared and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues "Things with the right snake struck at the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1: 0 (71).
20 minutes still to be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty room in the 80th minute.
referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase before Geske had the final victory in the 87th minute out of twelve meters.
Perhaps it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes.

Starting position: Four points after five days of playing - this was not enough for Trainer Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt wanted to ensure the first home victory.

Helicopters in Kottingbrunn
On landing, the accident occurred on the airfield.
The four passengers were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. a drama took place on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
A helicopter landing caused turbulence, as confirmed by the police against oe24.
The heli was captured by a gusset of wind, cracked down on the ground and came to the side of the ground.
Police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately agreed.
With a large deployment, the forces came to the accident site.
The ÖAMTC emergency thruster was also called for caution.
Slightly Inpatients

Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity in company boards.
As a result, only 8% of the boards of directors on the deadline of 1 September were women, as stated in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and which was presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass by them," said Stiftungs-Geschäftsführer Wiebke Ankersen.
In the US, the United Kingdom, or Sweden, purely male leadership teams are far from conceivable, with few exceptions.
The backwardness makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses among the companies of the index of medium sized assets (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8% of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8%.
In the 30 DAX companies, which have been pioneers in recent years, the proportion of women has stagnated.
Last, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not continue to commit to increasing the proportion of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: as of 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If the same number of women were recruited each year for the boards, 40% would be recruited as early as 2023," the report says.
Some even make a face: luxury cars: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves best.
The Italians take EUR 280,000 with every Ferrari sold and make a profit of EUR 69,000.
Large cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noblemen makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This issue has been dealt with by 'autopapst' and business professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 Euro in the first half of the year with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 Euro, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of money on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros earnings before interest and taxes.

He then came together at a crossroads with the taxi that drove at the green.
After the collision, the doctor ’ s car strolled against a traffic light mast and a tree.
In the same year, he recorded the Passantin, who died at the site of the accident.
Drivers of the emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured.
The sixty-year-old taxi driver and the emergency car driver were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from the workforce.
The 29-year-old notary, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency doctor called him tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were brought to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the public prosecutor in Bonn, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we do it uncomfortable.
Manchester United lost the league in the seventh round.
West Ham United is subject to ManU 1: 3. The way of defeat is.....
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute in which the reared Marko Arnautovic shot the 3: 1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly brought the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an offside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all Manchester's defenses remained standing, and Arnautovic left all the time in the world to shoot the ball by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a previously largely inadequate performance.
The mood at United ’ s Manchester City City is very different.
Citizens, trained by Mourinho ’ s great rival Pep Guardiola, came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an approximate 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider's shield for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also jumped to the top of the table.
Liverpool No More Table Leaders
Three days after the 1: 2 defeat in the league, Xherdan Shaqiri fought against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the cup out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old hit in the 25th minute remained the only match in the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who appeared in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, barely missed the match after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his thunder.
So, for the second time, Chelsea was unable to beat after the Reds started with a flawless record.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and through the draw in the league the blues Liverpool also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, London ’ s two city clubs, Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford), celebrated 2: 0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, where Grant Xhaka was playing through, had to wait for a success story against the surprise team from County Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford-Defender Craig Cathcart unsuccessfully bugged Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
Arsenal's fifth consecutive victory passed Watford and is now just behind the great rival Tottenham to 5th place.
The Wolves remained in the league for the fifth time in a row at 2: 0 against Southampton and finished 8th.
What ’ s missing from the VW Core: Paris ’ s Automobile Salon, reflecting the Diesel Debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject, yet ubiquitous: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let the German car companies loose at the Paris industry meeting either.
From next week at the 2018 Automobile Salon, they will show their new products in the French capital together with competitors from all over the world.
Diesel does not really play a major role in this.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should nevertheless be an important topic, at least behind the brilliant scenes of the trade fair stand.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have among others their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolstadt is due to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
But both were officially presented.
The iNext from BMW is scheduled to start in 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3 Series.
This year from 4 to 14 October more than 250 exhibitors will be represented.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than a million visitors arrived.
At least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi in the severe earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Dozens are missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
Two earthquakes struck the island on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport links have been damaged and enormous material damage has been caused.
After the earthquake, the tsunami invaded the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered together on the beach for a celebration.
There is a fear that the number of victims will increase significantly.
So far, the figures are only from Palu.
Many other communities are also affected, along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Biker Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing divine service for motorcyclists with a team of helpers at the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the programme.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral care of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September the traditional MoGo service takes place on the last Sunday of each month at Haus Nordhelle.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season at the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers met there on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
From 10 o ’ clock onwards, the ramparts were opened in front of the entrance to the church.
At first the biker ’ s spring was on the program and it was possible to strengthen itself with coffee and cake or even with a good currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was held during the Biker worship of parish priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical underscore.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill is rather poetic and quiet," says pastor Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the service of the Godfather.
Fechthorfer ’ s Homeland Society Celebrates Great Feast: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active at the actual day of action.
She served her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and showed his amazed audience step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step forward this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, layer by layer, that look a bit like haggle.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran gradually into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had ready-made specialities.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the newest feather white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly large.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents spoke, while the children were able to follow not only the process of apple pressing, but also the built castle for themselves.
Also active members of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers were involved in the festival and invited to play for a short time at some stations.
The local association will also offer an action day next year.
But then, as Gregor Krütkamp pointed out, the home house in the heart of the Savings Board will not be the place of events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is obvious because of the subject: after all, it will be all about milk.
1: 4 gegen Frankfurt: Hannover mit vierter Saison-Pleite: "Geissene Situation".
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, there were not many positive things to see at the 1: 4 (0: 2) last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It is a cunning situation, but you have to face up to it as a team," said 96 football professor Pirmin Schwegler, and said: "This is of course disappointing, because you always think a lot about it".
The more triumphant Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met to join, are at the very bottom with two meters and are a candidate for the podium in their current constitution.
On the other hand, guided by the outstanding Ante Reć, Frankfurt celebrated the first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebić (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators who, after the successful general rehearfor the European against Lazio in Rome with seven.
Croatia ’ s Vice-World Champion Rebić was involved in almost every dangerous offensive by the Hessen during his starter debut and never got under control by Hannovers ’ defenses.
The storm, long after the World Cup, showed with its speed and assertiveness why it is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rekic, the Brazilian, borrowed by FC Liverpool, Allan was the first time in the early formation of Frankfurt, which started in a lively manner.
A football from Lucas Torró (17), twisted to the net, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, in a promising position, Sébastien Haller was stopped at the last moment by the 96 defence against the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short term Kevin Wimmer (back).
Leadership for homeowners fell almost inevitably and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defensive corner in the penalty room, Haller extended per head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga player for the French second league player AJ Auxerre, who came in the summer.
And Frankfurt did so before the break.
This time Haller was passing on to his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully sank through and didn't give Michael Esser a chance.
In the half-time, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak vision of his elf, bringing two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Niedersachsen played a bit bolder forward, but ignominious ideas remained out until just before the end, when the next meeting was still successful.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After less than an hour, Reć started a solo and then set off on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only a show run for the Frankfurt public against overcrowded guests, even Jovic met one minute before the end.
Morlaix Square becomes a party.
Würselen Despite cool temperatures the atmosphere was good at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.

Violin: Violin Christians Celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The vulsing Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on 14 September or on Sunday after.
The ceremonial service takes place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with its final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ from the Thirty Years War on which, according to legend, a Swedish soldier was shot.
Blood then flowed from the rubble.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the altarpiece stands, the missing longhouse is hinted by the trees.
In his sermon, parish priest Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The religious service was poorly attended despite the importance for the violin parish.
After the divine service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing ended the church part of the Cross.
For many years now, the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food and a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church. On behalf of the parish, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the planned construction work which will continue until next year.
Since the framework has already been in place for some time, the damage has been more accurately identified and the individual calls for proposals have been prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has increased, but there has also been more evidence of what was only made possible by the use of scaffolding.
The plaster work has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before the winter and it is hoped to be possible to complete half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New residential home in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for disabled people in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" will now be handed over to its purpose in the Münsterblickstraße - there was agreement among all those present at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the living quarters of the life aid Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader took into account broader corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officer building was put to the test for the residents of Handicap: "The house had come into the years and had not been equipped with modern equipment," Bader retrospectively said.
In 2016, the excavators went to demolish the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel at home, according to the architect.
Help Donau-Iller Open New Home
About 4.6 million euros were invested in living aid in the new building.
The Free State increased EUR 2.4 million, the district of Swabia EUR 450000.
According to architect Bader, the construction works remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, thanked him for this too..
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, Head of Social Administration of the district of Swabia, said: "The house is geared to the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile".
The living space and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And again: "The plot in this situation is a real stroke of luck, because it is no longer possible to buy it in the current situation".
Altogether, the new residential home in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities, spread over three residential groups, on almost 1500 square metres.
Heinz, Managing Director of Life Aid, is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by Fare.
Germany: Sweden laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, the Deputy Federal Chairman of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germany.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to the" Sunday mirror ".
The objective must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germany, on average, worked longer than the people of West Germany, but received 15% less pay.
"I cannot explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this clean dog stop the Korean conflict?
The one-year old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang gave a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about one year old, reached their recipient on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to "facilitate the weaning of animals".
The dogs with the thick white coat, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join forces in international sports competitions, such as the 2020 Olympic Games, and to apply jointly for the Olympic Games to be held in 2032.
In the process of rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile engines.
Austria ’ s Moved History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, a number of new books have been published, which mostly answer this question in retrospect over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, writes it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be released on October 1.
New Week, New Chance for the Government
Back to the substantive work, that is the unofficial motto of the Great Coalition working week that begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, the SPD and also from the CSU did not last mention the 'return to the work of the substance' in mantra-like terms.
This may have led some artisans, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in that country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its task of governing, it should not be deterred by conceptual debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blasts of recent weeks may already be clear on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet in the coalition committee.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflict early, a lesson of all the dispute.
First of all, however, diesel retrofits and the law on skilled migration once again raise conflicting issues.
The CSU Transport Minister, Mr Scheuer, wants to let car companies get away with exchange premiums, while the SPD and the CDU see manufacturers as being obliged to retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has marked a rapprochement over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned law on skilled migration.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the 'change of track' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among coalition partners - and how else?
It was not the same thing that joined the GroKo together, but three partners with sometimes very different social views and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society characterised by such diverse, sometimes conflicting interests is not making progress.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not again be fuelled for party-tactical reasons on the question of being or not.
This is still about politics, not about theatre.
The Union and the SPD should argue - but always have a view on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this key issue, both the diesel and track change issues can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
That is what the popular parties must now fight for.
Pilz Checks Working Hours at Hartinger
Minister in Target
Is it the Minister of Labour who is violating the law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" their legislators would have worked on social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister when she presented it two weeks ago.
The statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) by Daniela Holzinger, a member of the list mushroom mandate, is met with astonishment - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via a question.
She assumes that 'the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and that she did not wish to declare any violations of the law of service in front of cameras running'.
Nevertheless, they now have questions in order to "acquit Har ­ tinger of any suspicion".
Police Breaks a Street in Search of Women ’ s Like
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to speak.
Now we have confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the road between Naila and Bad Steben has been excavated.
The route is closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday.
It was assumed that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, was able to limit the relevant position to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomalie has been discovered in the area of the said road site, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian National Heritage Authority.
For more than a year already the Public Prosecutor and Criminal Police Court have been processing the missing case.
A cycle path was repeatedly blocked by Marxgrün and examined with sonars because investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been buried here 30 years ago as part of the construction of the state road.
Colour powder and eggs: Crawls in Barcelona before Catalonia ’ s anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But there have been riots before.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona – Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and the police occurred in the center of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence campaigners with, among other things, colour powder to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the civil guard.
Some 3 000 police officers from the National Police and Guardia Civil Police units wanted to use a demonstration to honour their colleagues who were in service last year during the illegal referendum in the polling stations.
There was also violence at that time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the separatist demonstrations and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the 6000 separatists, however, would then have violently tried to break the police chain, using, among other things, beatings and eggs for officials.
Six people have been arrested and 24 others have been slightly injured under appeal to the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the referendum on independence.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under forced management in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled to Belgium.
Other politicians, too, turned to foreign countries.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in U-prison.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the administration was terminated.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Unsettled Rattlelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen disco.
Red and white Ahlen continues on the spot.
Even the FC Gütersloh had only a 0: 0 draw.
The rear lights and the third last one appeared to 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as a total helplessness.
The first half was overseen by the entertainment factor.
So if you wanted to get a beer or a sausage, you could do it safely.
There was no risk of missing a torchance, because there was virtually none.
Half an Hour First Shot
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility was the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westerkerling forced him into a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the prison line.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced for reasons of injury, and Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel was aiming just over the housing from 18 meters and after an hour the freight car also appeared on the offensive for the first time.
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz it went fix.
"Nick Flock (62.)" crowned the quickly performed Konter over Sinan Aygün with a gentle shot into the arms of RWA orwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played Wieckowicz's (66th) headball after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It did nothing.
The Ahlener did not achieve anything more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did it.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: 'I like the fact that we played to zero', but unfortunately the zero was also in the front.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against Woodwindede and that although our opponent did not want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensive, "everything so a bit" pleaded against a team that only wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not feel that we could get the opposite, "says Daut.
As a spectator, however, one did not feel that his team could score a goal.
The idea was too meagre.............
Reckenfeld ’ s Harvest Market: Fortunately, there are enough of them.
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tabelausgabstelle, for whom these donations are intended.
The official assurances: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky was shining blue, while the square was still somewhat empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
For: "Here it is so nice sociable, so we are here today", said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holtür welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a real sense of humour.
For Brockmann, who was supposed to be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer quickly jumped in.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough of them.
And the "replacement" could not be taken to entertain the increasing number of visitors.
It was so good that some folk songs were sung at the late hour.
"Just great", Marcel Kreimer was delighted.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date on his schedule this time.
He is happy about the many active people with their stands, mostly clubs.
"Actually there should not be anything like a table," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivities and the Clean Up campaign which took place in September.
Our garden town has a colourful coat of paint - here is what is going on.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück ’ s Maikrat was taken to the Winterquartier with the help of the fire brigade.
Many stands were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty detention everything was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has been living in Reckenfeld for only one year, has been creative on his decupier saw.
He offered veneer work, beer lid with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a specialty: "Reckenfelder Honey", accompanied by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so tasted the cake.
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to stay long into the evening hours, even without a stage programme that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Blacksmithing with a local political message: no successful advertising of skate plants.
In Len, unknowns have hardly promoted the prospect of building a skate facility in a meaningful.. were. were. were.. were,
In several places there are corresponding blacksmiths, says Jürgen Kohne of the City Council at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been brought against the police for damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Len" are used on signs at the Gemmpt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding inscription on the advertising sign on the stairway to the Gemmpt-Bistro had already been discovered after the trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an Edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later this was back, this time sprayed on", says Rottmann.
He assumes that the appropriate advertising shield must be replaced.
A special feature of this particular case is the fact that several large companies are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate system is built, it will also be possible to realize it by sponsors.
Commitments have already been made, explains Jörg Hesselmann of the urban field of education, sport and culture, without mentioning names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those listed on the awarded board.
For years local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skateboarding.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
After all, the majority of the Council was in favour of the fire-fighting car park.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently opposed construction at this point.
At the end of June, a U-turn followed.
The members of the main and financial committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School.
As for the state of affairs, Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the midst of concrete planning.
The City Council then has the last word.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be taken.
The Air Traffic Impass Making Worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg Following the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no sign of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have a strong wind and then the storm comes," said Matthias Maas, the head of the aviation union, the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the many delays and flight losses was the long-known staffing shortage of European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist..
Across Europe, the market is empty for fully trained pilots.
About a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the federal government, countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic City to address the causes of delays.
"If we want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, we will not do that without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German Federal Air Traffic Control.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for pilotage.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost specifications and personnel savings in the national air traffic control systems are now fully in line with the operational business.
Maas called on Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that do not "cut off the air even further".
At present, the EU ’ s requirements would be agreed by 2024 and there is a fear of further tightening.
The EU is under constant pressure from the airlines.
"Ryan CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now harvesting exactly what they have sown in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high cost of airline delays will lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if the German Air Safety Authority (DFS) provides a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
The previously announced annual intake of 120 pilots over the next five years was just sufficient to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staff building is not yet connected with this.
ThyssenKrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Group Conversion
The members of the ThyssenKrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the Group's restructuring plans.
According to Chairman Guido Kerkhoff, Interim Chairman of ThyssenKrupp, appointed as Chairman of the Executive Board at Sunday ’ s meeting, the crisis group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no further reductions in staff beyond the administrative cuts already known.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees face this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50% share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company ThyssenKrupp Industrials AG, the business of lifts and supplies is to be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence in demonstrations by police and Catalan supporters of independence.
In two parallel demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan advocates of independence in Barcelona, there were violent clashes with many injured.
According to the city administration, some 3000 police from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 pro-independence demonstrators.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests out of hand with a large crowd.
According to the forces, however, pro-independence advocates repeatedly attempted to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked officials with paint and shootings.
According to the data, there were also rangleies between the participants in the various protests.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to those colleagues who fought almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police force and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve far more than they deserve.
The demonstrators saw it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona, of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, dismissed the charge.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year did only their duty: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues' did not come to provoke ', the policeman assured us.
Panne Allowed Access to British Ministers ’ Personal Data

According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory Party conference in Birmingham.

Football: Juve Trailer praises for top: Ronaldo ’ s best game.
The Portuguese star player "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3: 1 (1: 1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the expensive Star, even without his own goal, was the decisive man in the important match against the tracker.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and makes it good," said Allegri.
Although we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early lag due to the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and temporarily suspended the worst runner.
Real Madrid ’ s goalkeeper, Mario Mandzukic, the former Bundesliga professional, first set the ball in a double pack (26 / 49).
Ronaldo also did the groundwork for the defence chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.), after a corner of a headball, who only had to push in shortly before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team of record contactors.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach said.
Best Juve Orguard is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the excess power of Juventus seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games, the impeccable series in the series A. At 21 points, the master of the last seven years already has six counters ahead of Naples.
The second table, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the placement of the already undeclared Mario Rui (58) the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to get tough after Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the place.
"We played well against a good Naples", commented the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also mentioned here.
The German national player won the Juve.
FC Liverpool ’ s professional was in service at all seven league matches.
The middle field actor also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown out of the pitch during the 2: 0 victory of the Turin people and is closed for the home match against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday.
Kanye West Change Its Name
Rapper Kanye West has made a particularly bizarre appearance at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a Mineralwasser costume caused eyebrows and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let him only be called "Yes", according to the musician.
"The character that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted to the late singer Prince when he dropped his name.
However, the pseudonym is no news.
Already the tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRL, the artist explained that "Yes" had a religious significance for him.
"I think" Yes "is the most used word in the Bible and there it means" you ", according to the rapper.
Football: Circular League A1 Münster: Finally!
Enough!
Hoetmar ’ s coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a poor game of ours today.
The adversary was simply more griffy, we almost never faced problems ".
Two goals chances in 90 minutes, which rarely makes playing positive.
Football club A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) photo: Heinz Schwackenberg.
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but the first one was Maik Krause from pointed angle to early guidance (7th).
Steffen Uphus could have raised in the 43rd minute, but after a great preliminary work from Krause he was left standing.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when Moritz Höne first failed at Torsteiger Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all gave up.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the gate line and saw red for it - was also unable to use Niklas Eilmann for the guests (75.).
It was only when Nils Berheide shot the ball over the line that the match was decided (81.).
"We had been severely critical of ourselves before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleef, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Gates: 0: 1 Krause (7), 0: 2 Berheide (81).
Red card: Kortenjann (75. / Hoetmar).
Football: Circular League A2 Münster: Spectacle Football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3: 4.
"I don't know what to think of it," he rang for words.
"We didn't get access to them at all," he was supposed to mean the wingspan with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other Green whites that met with a collective offensive urge.
However, he was able to laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, cheeky and drew from dann His players, however, was relieved to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel of two teams, one of which, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the preservation of the class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back to the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"How we come back after 0: 2, how we oppose one of the league's top teams throughout the game time, that was really phenomenal".
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top Torjäger Lars Zymner took the host to the lead with his 12th season meeting (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2: 0 he placed on the left side in exemplary fashion for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't handle such a player completely.
"That was already madness, what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of his opponent without envy.
Shortly before the change of direction, his own elf made the balance: McGill's freekick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long Toreck (45).
After the change of direction, it was McGill who made the balance (59).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a tough, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69).
In spite of the overwhelming number, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia match (80th).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against jackets, that is what we must win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87.
Tore: 1: 0 Zymner (24), 2: 0 Fröhning (39), 2: 1 McGill (45), 2: 2 McGill (59), 3: 2 Nübel (64), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80).
Yellow red: Atalan (74. / Albachten).

Erdogan in Germany: Politics Instead of Pomp
Good that he is gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany is as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent Guests and New Offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he will personally collect the price of tolerance in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as president he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was guest there.
This is how Udo Hahn, an academic director, reckoned with him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellor have already been with us.
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker participates in a seminar on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann attended a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he will personally receive the Academy's "Tolerance Prize" in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings until mid-2019 have it in their own right.
"The pension is not safe!" is included in a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria:" barbarism without limit ".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war mocevery human idea ".

What about neutrality?
"We are 100 per cent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said head of study Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 per cent neutral".
Music Cabaret: Heart of Gender Understanding - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret star, Teubner pretended gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
The mini guitar put her in and also mastered her violin.
Ben Sükrrup sat on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, and on the other he is a true pianist: Sürschüp Teubner, so congenially harmonically accompanies Sübner that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, as it was to the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought into play a paradox: contentment comes with the man when he has a partner but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner on the other hand is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have arisen from Mozart's composing, had "the Nannerl" opened the door unhoped-for?
Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Main full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart g minor symphony into a playful dance.
There were great applause and 'bravo' from the full room.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, Treasurer of the Association, the Chansonette.
However, the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take any additional thanks.
She had the idea of giving the duo a concert in Wolbeck in addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt..

The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk may remain CEO of the Tesla electric car, but he must chair the board.
Musk also agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay a double-digit million fine, as the SEC reported.
The background is Musk's surprising announcement of August to take Tesla off the stock exchange.
The SEC accused Musk in her lawsuit of making false and misleading claims.

Handball: Ladies League: Ahlener SG keeps the white waistcoat against TV Wattenscheid.
The girls had problems especially with the third league player Caroline Stallmann, who scored ten matches on her own.
"Actually I was very satisfied with the defenses, only one player made too many goals.
We have not got a grip on them, "says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed about the many opportunities that were missed.
This time his team missed the focus.
The ASG was therefore almost behind to the end, with a break of 11: 12 and later 15: 18 (45) behind.
It was only towards the end that the broader host bank made a decisive difference.
In addition, Aydogdu placed the spine of Merle Klement on left columns, which then made "extremely clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Rushhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.

Thanks to a top performance in the top-level game, the BSV Ostbevern volleyball women have once again established themselves in the top class of the 3rd League West.
At second league runner-up VC Allbau Essen the blue whites won 3: 1.
"This was a giant step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
That's what we've done ", coach Dominik Münch rejoiced after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the shortened table leader.
The first passage dominated the guests almost at will.
Over 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 he went to the vice-champion of the previous year at 25: 15.
Eating has been accepted in the second panel, but has not come into play.
We have done it well.
Our adversary hit with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence the BSV already led with 12: 8 "Essen has changed the acceptance to triple bars.
We could not keep the pressure on the label.
Eating was a bit of a bit of a hassle, "says Münch.
At 18: 17 the volleyball women from the Ruhrgebiet had the front.
In the 19th: 24, the Eastern Beasts defeated four matches, but the fifth attempt was made.
"The game was now a better class," the practice manager said.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly with their surcharges to the fact that the BSV turned the leaf in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "We played here consistently and calmly".
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13, the Blue White Pass brought four to their side at 25: 22.

BSV-women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachauer, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Community: Opening the Mosques as a Lost Chance
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the manner in which the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosques in Cologne has left a mess in German-Turkish relations that can only be laboriously swept together," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the opportunity to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of underlining the Muslim affiliation with Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," he lamented.
The widespread exclusion of the German public "reinforced many reservations".
Homeland Club of Nottuln: Offer is already established.
After the long summer break there is finally a time for torture.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the local association Nottuln is already organising its fifth Nottulner Folktroff in the Kaminzimmer der Alten Amtmannei.
Almost exactly to the day, it was a year ago that we performed a torture operation for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln ", comments Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner home association.
I would not have thought that our torture efforts would get into Nottuln so quickly.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or heatwave in July, the Amtmannei Kaminzimmer was always full.
"The programme at the next Folktraff is, as always, a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and seafaring songs, folk songs, evergreens and old drums", says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his chordeon for the first Folktraff- "Birthday".
He has been a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from the neighbouring group Steinfurt who played music with plattdeutsche texts.
Now he is on the road with an Irish Folk Band.
The makers of the Folktraff will be happy to recall the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktraff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Frösche am Nacht", inspired the listeners and sent them home with an earwax.
"We expect a lot of happy guests to spend a nice and humorous evening again", says the invitation of the local association.
Those who play an instrument and want to participate actively are invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always quickly occupied, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The film will start at 7.30 p.m., but the entrance is already at 7 p.m.
China ’ s Approved Merge of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step towards becoming the world ’ s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that the billions of euros will still be spent on permits in South Korea and, as the biggest hurdle, in the United States.
Most recently, the chances of an insider ’ s agreement had improved, because Linde promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit to ecology
A gala in Dr.-Stammberger-Halle celebrated the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and national care.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus set the last foundation impulse for the Kreissverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
In 1893, he was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa.
The purpose of the fruit growing association also differed from today's work - in fact, it was only a matter of fruit growing, but at that time no one thought about flowers and gardening.
"At that time, in the age of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites," explained Kreisheim custodian Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees should border roads, so-called industrial gardens have been set up in schools.
Today, fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play as much a role as providing knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Maulzug" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge issue for us children, and I doubt that Smartphone & Co. can be used to gather just as much joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Sölner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added the district council of Sölner and highlighted the particular importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt about the fact that district manager and specialist adviser Friedhelm Haun.
He presented the many visitors with an image of the long history of the county council and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was given.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the commercial garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has survived, it was here before us and we must follow it", the expert argued for fruit and nut trees.
That is why the horticultural associations are being encouraged not to let up so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, as the President of the Bavarian Land Association, Wolfram Vaitl, added.
"We have to stop the glaring decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the Thurnau music club's towers.

Priority to Nafta Talks: Canada ’ s Secretary of State Releases UN Speech
Mexico ’ s government wants clarity on Nafta: they are putting an ultimatum to both trading partners for an agreement.
Canada's Secretary of State now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Canada ’ s Secretary of State, Chrystia Freeland, has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York, owing to pressure of time in the struggle for a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico.
Instead of this Saturday, the Minister will speak only on Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman told Adam Austen.
In the meantime, they are focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canadian and US negotiators would have 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August to recast the Nafta regional free-trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Discussions on a new edition have been going on for more than a year.
They are now to be completed by Sunday evening (local time), and Trump ’ s administration wants to submit the deal to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico ’ s President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral deal with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a trade fair raid, has left the hospital.
According to a report by the newspaper "O Globo", the far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in South America last week before the presidential election.
The politician had been attacked openly in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular called for protests against the ex-military.
Bolsonaros was also a member of the United Nations.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In Brazil, the protests mixed with a rally by the Brazilian Workers ’ Party (PT) presidential candidate Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As former mayor of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump Brasil" has long been involved in political activity, but is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a run-off on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully, no matter who he opposes.
Bolsonaro is known for his hatred of homosexuals and blacks and glorifies the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Time and again he is shocked by verbal derailments.
Once again, he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.

The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children on the death bed.
The musician had been treated for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasoline ', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music giants like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.

He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
On Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen acknowledged Larsen as a 'street boy' who was' against everything but in all hearts'.
The head of the government also recalled that in 2010, the monarchie opponent Larsen had appeared at the 70th anniversary of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.

The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows how to convince the audience at the start of the concert evening with the latest unknown pieces from his own pen and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band will perform in harmony and pressure.
Although "Addition" stage is not to be missed, "Tiger Bonesaw" will leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Hardrock is not the same as hardrock. Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierkingi am Bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate their alternative, sometimes classical rock sounds of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is also used at "Here We Stand".
Not only the yearning, almost ballade-like "Take Me Home" captivates by the change of melodic passages to the guitar heavy rock riffs of the complex songs.
Since its foundation in 2005, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has gained a special reputation.
The band presents their hardrock on Saturday with full agility.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with her performances in front of a large audience - documented recently in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
In cooperation with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own particular emphasis on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" from Cameo from the 80s.
Guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo while he runs through the audience.
A certain volume of music belongs to this kind of hardrock concert, of course: at the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to information from the mixed pulpit team, the three concerts of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" are about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of compressed air hammers, but is thus still significantly below the control of the "Wacken-Feistvals", to which "The Ignition" refers on its website.
The Ahlener audience doesn ’ t need it on this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long been convincing with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone-saw and set off a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say at the end, albeit in a figurative sense.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A Victory in a Sailplane Accident at Essen / Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Essen Airport.
A glider plane crashed on Sunday at a car park at Mülheim / Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim / Essen Airport.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider plane crashed at the airport parking lot.
The pilot lost his life.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the student was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a one-seater.
The plane was already on landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a few steps away from the airport tent.
But there has been an October Festival since this weekend.
Mülheim / Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr districts and directly at the entrance to the motorway 52.
From the car park there is a Park & Ride offer at large events at the Essen Fair Centre or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump tells Kim: "And then we fell in love."
It is no secret that North Korea ’ s leader Kim is well disposed to the nuclear crisis.
Now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president announced a new flame.
The tragedy: it is a distant relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Before supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump was almost enraged for the half-old sprout of Pyongyang ’ s ruling dynastic dynasty, even though it turns out to be rather tough in the struggle for North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he was too, and between us we went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it is not just talks with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote wonderful letters, great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump has pointed to Kim ’ s announcement that all nuclear and missile tests will be halted, even if critics so far see little more than lip service.
The US president seemed to be well aware of the fact that everyone is not likely to be sympathetic to whether his notorious "Rocket Man" (nicknamed Kim) is a martial drug.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism in his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
He did not care much about it, Trump explained, and then turned his finger on the crowd: "I have always told you it is so easy to be presidential."
But then there would not be 10 000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena, but only 200 people out there.
October Festival attracts many guests to Baesweiler.
Baesweiler Bestens attends, moods and on top of that spoils with sun: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair Baesweiler ´ s inner city plastered itself out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest was not only held in the Festzelt at the Feuerwehrturm, but was extended to the City by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees Saved by Video from Libyan Prison
Nigerian refugees, using a mobile phone video, have pointed to their dire conditions of detention in Libya, enabling them to be rescued.
The group had shot the recording in her cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually sent to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we would probably not have been able to return to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger of life.
One of his comrades was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
Generally speaking, the conditions of detention were disastrous: 'They swallowed us all with pipes and sticks'.
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back home this year through the program, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions in which they are being in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a call for help via a mobile phone video.
International organisations have long criticised the situation in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, dominated largely by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 16: 50 the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the hall of the 1st floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a bull to the ground floor or the entrance.
The teacher informed the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot be said yet.
Daily description: 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark t-shirt.
Please contact the police officer Obernberg am Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.
Germany was trapped in its own car for days.
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central France after he had locked the car off all the forest tracks and a tree blocked the car door.
On Saturday afternoon rescue workers accidentally discovered the car near a meadow and freed the missing person since Tuesday evening, informed the police on Sunday.
According to the data, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long period of absence.
He said to look forward to his home.
The pensioner was reported to have been missing by his family after he had not returned from a drive over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday with his 4x4.
Despite intensive search, the man's whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet Calls for the Rule of Law in Turkey
In talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The two countries' relations are currently 'overshadowed', Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns, above all, waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore 'made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important precondition for this'.
According to Laschet, he also mentioned the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then reaffirmed the independence of Turkey ’ s judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had at short notice been moved to a building of the readiness of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn, but the castle owners rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel after the conversation to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
However, he said: 'The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country'.
We are also their interlocutors - not the Turkish President.
Mistrust in the US: North Korea Calls for Disarmament
While US President Trump never tire of emphasizing the successes of negotiations on denuclearization in North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Secretary of State Ri is calling for Washington to cooperate.
North Korea ’ s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons in the UN General Debate with its continued sanctions. in.
"The recent deadlock is that the US is relying on coercive measures that are lethal for confidence-building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable in these circumstances for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there is no way that we will disarm ourselves as the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that punitive measures could 'bring North Korea to its knees' is' a pipe dream of people who do not know us'..
In order to build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear testing facility, Ri emphasized.
However, the US side did not respond to this, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council decided on three sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, have been pushing for strict compliance with sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working towards rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea ’ s leader, Kim Jong-un.
After the first Singapore summit, the US president wants a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on ending North Korea ’ s nuclear program.
The HoT Serves: New Cooking with Community Donations
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting did not come with the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a big buffet waiting for the guests after the Erntedank-service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was funded by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and we were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break the bad surprise came: a blackout had put off the huge, two-piece refrigerator, the food was spoilt and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from scratch: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it on their own", says Westbuer.
And so everyone got along.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Chefs can't do better," a visitor praised, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiches, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people got on their feet," said pastor Frank Beckmann, while wizards made Stephan Lammen amaze with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board of Directors NRW of the Tafel.
Out of frustration with criticism from the own ranks, Jörg Sartor, head of the Essen Tafel, has given his post in the national association.
Sartor had become known throughout Germany because the Essen Tafel had introduced a stop to foreigners.
He had already resigned as deputy head of NRW panels in July, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I have fallen too many in the back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, the head of the NRW Table Country Association, expressed sympathy with the dpa for the decision of his long-time deputy.
Sartor took the harsh criticism with him.
"I understand his step - people who did not know exactly why the Essen Tafel did it.
But Sartor is still active for the Essen Tafel - "six days a week, there is no change", says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday" Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels.
We must not take the approach of 'without us the people of the city starve to death'.
It is up to the state to ensure that people do not die of starvation.
The Essener did not participate in a congress of the panels in Berlin on Friday.
"I am told too much sweet dirt," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that criticised me at the time.
SF Lorch waste 2: 0 leadership - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2: 3 - TV hypocrites wins in Kirchheim after lag - Bettringen beats Lauchheim.
At 2: 0, Lorch was already in the lead against the TV Neuler in the home match - at the end, the 2: 3 and the disappointment among the sportsmen was great.
The TV hypocrites were quite different: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0: 1, but after 90 minutes it won with 2: 1 at the top of the the SGwas with a 3.
Gladbach ’ s Two-Way Leadership - Schalke Without Embolo with First Victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach still has to wait for a victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2: 2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke wins the first season against Mainz (1: 0).
(sda) Four times in the first five games, Schalke has manoeuvred himself to the far side with early opponents.
Now Domenico Tedesco ’ s team once again showed the strength with which it took the first place in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after heavy groundwork by Yevgeni Konopljanka, and then the hosts conserved the minipole with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is receiving new greetings from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had managed a 0: 2 behind Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half it still won the 4: 2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65) and Marco Reus (69) ran out with a double in four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided the finishing touches to the performance increase after the break with another double in the final phase (86th / 94th).
The first victory was also the VfB Stuttgart.
The Stuttgarter had to fight against the Werder Bremen, which was decimated by a yellow red card against Milos Veljkovic even before the break.
Borna Sosa and the insensitive Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious disposable owner, which helped the guests to compensate for the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not make a completely successful but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who joined the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, twice gave a lead, ended up playing 2: 2 and are still waiting for a victory in the VW City since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's 1-1 balance, Renato Steffen was in charge with his second Bundesliga.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the flax shot of 20 meters of the Aargauer, just as he was at the second counterbuffer after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are very promising.
Alassane Pléa, in the storm of the foals, is increasingly proving to be a goalgetter.
Against Wolfsburg, the record French purchase from OGC Nice met for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in a mandatory game.
After seven laps, Gladbach takes fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unassailable Werder Bremen against the VfB Stuttgart got into an uncomfortable position.

Although Stuttgart-based defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back into the game with a curious one-way owner (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarter in large numbers back to the Victory Road.
Nürnberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3: 0 sovereign.
After half an hour Hanno Behrens put the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians Vote on New State Names
In Macedonia today, some 1.8 million citizens vote on whether their country's name should be changed in North Macedonia.
A yes vote could resolve the nearly three decades of simmering conflict with Greece ’ s neighbor.
Athens had insisted on a change of name because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any rapprochement between Macedonia and the West.
Voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum had been positive.
Syrians in U-prison.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian beat three pensioners brutally, sometimes seriously injuring them.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker was rioting at about 10 p.m. on Friday at the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went to passers-by with clumsy fists and tried to attack them, about his behavior.
The Syrians then tried to beat and step down the officials.
A little later, it turned out that the suspect had just beaten three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists at a tram stop in the currency street.
He also trampled the trio with his feet.
Some pensioners have been seriously injured.
She suffered hematomas, prellations and brain shafts.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured 'for unknown reasons', as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politicians: Johannes Kahr marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahr married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave their names on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahr had previously told the "picture" newspaper.
"If we get married, it is right," he has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahr is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD Bundestag group and one of the speakers of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
On June 30, 2017, in the federal debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahr had provoked a furious outcry.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he alluded to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the case of adoption law.
Garden Day: Cut 400 Meters
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the civic association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
About 400 metres of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründner House should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this in order to reduce costs," said the chairman of the citizens' association, Walter Schröer.
And so much has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a form cut.
For as early as spring, the hedges were already held back.
The breakfast, which is always followed by work, has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stick to their guns," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner brings gold to the Canoeing World Cup.
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canoeing World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old set a perfect course on Sunday on the Olympic course.
Two years ago he missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of second.
I was well prepared, had enough trips here on the facility and everything was fit today, "said the Olympia Third in London in 2012.
In the end, he threw away his paddle with joy and raised both arms safely - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not topple their fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The police officer Gauling reports this autumn's first attempt at burglary into a family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of.
For example, the police inspectorate, Mr Gauting, reported yesterday the first attempt at breaking in this autumn.
It was thanks to the alarm system that it remained at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße.
After all, the perpetrators got off to work on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars knew that the inhabitants were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised her so that she could escape without prey.
Hint to the PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Hertha ’ s Fall: Recovered of reality: Bavaria versus Ajax
The title is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin is not something the FC Bayern wants to "not let go".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for Niko Kovac ’ s term of office.
The first small performance event under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase for the Munich community to a higher industrial level.
"A week ago one had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we got a bit of reality ", Thomas Müller noted after the deserved 0: 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and asked for a reaction for the Champions League Duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that we are really annoyed about this and that we are therefore giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year no own goal has been shot abroad, as at the same time of the low season two mandatory games in series without victory, the Bundesliga table leadership initially lost to Borussia Dortmund.
While the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of Carlo Ancelotti ’ s failure at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its running intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners with their playful needle stitching over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last seemingly overwhelming Bayern are to be cracked.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we will not let this happen and we will do everything we can to ensure that we succeed again," said Kovac.
However, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city, and merely pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach for the lack of opportunity again.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless be a positive outcome of his first interim term of office before the national break - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse.
Thus, before this season ’ s second premier performance, Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which had also won against AEK Athens at 3: 0.
"Now we got caught in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Just like after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place Joshua Kimmich spoke clear text.
The lawyer appeared in the role of Mahner.
"I do not think that this is all bad luck, we have to work out it again because we do not make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes at the back," said the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season the Bayern were already behind Dortmund by five meters, which has now taken the lead again with one point.
And so Kimmich was at least positive with a wink that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, this is good," said the national player.
It is good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Shot Line: Özil-Causa: Sharp Attack by Erdogan to Grindel
The Turkish President, Erdogan, deplores the marginalisation of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious accusations.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new item is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in Mesut Özil's perpetual stride theme.
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB boss defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, the Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the Causa sports studio in Mainz.
"In future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U teams - we must draw very close conclusions that this does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integrationswoman.
At the same time, Grindel once again declared that Erdogan did not support the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp terms, he denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and adult Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they were allowed to shoot with me in England, "Erdogan said on Saturday in the Cathedral City.
Frankly, as their president, I could not have believed that our two young men, who rose to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "sensibly treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would face players in the future.
That someone says: if I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
I have always said that we should have defended Mesut more.
However, he does not see any basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integrationist will be appointed.
"If a person without a migrant background has a clear influence on society and football and says:" The issue is important, we have to take care of it ", this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again next year as president of the DFB.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as possible," Grindel said.
Three accidents per year in three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As the police reported, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
The 75-year-old driver was first addressed by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
He told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
There was no staff exchange because the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone notification of a car driver coming off the road and driving against a key post.
To this point, the man did not want a police force on the ground and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler went home.
However, in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, the pensioner has gone about this and collected a construction vehicle when he turns.
After all, the police could find and stop him.
His car suffered significant accidents.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much more.
The damage is approximately EUR 1300.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 forces are still in operation.
About four weeks after the Moorbrands outbreak on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 troops are still employed in the fire fighting operations.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
According to a spokesman, the situation continues to develop in a stable manner, and 70 volunteers have been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of personnel is planned.
During the night of Sunday a fire was discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was proclaimed more than a week earlier on 21 September, because it was feared that the flames, caused by wind and radio flying, would endanger adjacent forests and settlements.
It was then said on Thursday that the fire would no longer be spreading to neighbouring communities.
At times, more than 1500 local forces tried to control the large-scale fire.
The air force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test grounds near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones from the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are scheduled for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The Moorbrands smoke flag had been drawn from time to time up to a hundred kilometres far beyond the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a point of contact to receive claims for compensation.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday owners.

Referendum in Macedonia on new State names
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state is to be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is what our neighbour Greece insists on because of its northern province of the same name.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote 'yes', they will also be giving the go-ahead for their country's western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The Author who Save the Shoah from Forgetting

The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the US in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the Shoah ’ s horrors for posterity.
Switzerland Launches Electronic Register of Organ Donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members from stress.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs can continue to be taken only with express consent, Swisstransplant emphasises.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members from stress.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs can continue to be taken from organs only with express consent, as in Germany, Swisstransplant emphasises.
It is assumed that 15% of Swiss citizens have a donor card, says Franz immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only five per cent of cases will a card be found at the decisive moment in potential donors.
In more than 60% of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome", says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations of storing data on possible organ donation on the health card, as Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation - is not available," she says.
Federal Minister for Health Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be regarded as organ donors, unless he or she disagree.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old pupil is World Champion in Headcount
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in headcount.
At the weekend in Wolfsburg he met 39 fellow combatants.
This was informed by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue for the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greetings from Germany took third place.
The youngest of the World Cup participants was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest of a 74 year old French retiree, as Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
For example: 14,130 214 x 17,981.822 or 57,809.355 + 28 x 16,448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon in which participants rate against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Greß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greß was in Bielefeld two years ago when he was 14 years old.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or prodigy Laue can do little.
"Headcount can be trained," he said.
Many participants spent several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, even stadiums have computer competitions.
Among the disciplines, for example, is the square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating the versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they have to quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans would also have a good chance here, said the chief judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage, because they learn headcount more intensively and with other effective methods even in early childhood.
Strong appeal: video with naked Serena Williams: this is about breast cancer screening.
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off its emotional and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to draw attention to breast cancer and fight for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings at the top without the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinls" - only her hands cover up their most intimate positions.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of this.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which deals with breast cancer screening, can save lives.
Serena Williams himself would have died almost a year ago.
Complications occurred when her daughter Alexis Olympia was born.
An emergency operation was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clumps were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Banning More Extremist Symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will report a draft law on the so-called 'symbolism law'.
This is intended to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Cold Cold Cold Air in the West Bring New Snows to the Mountain
Next week, Mrs. Holle shakes off her beds in the West for the first time: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, NordTyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists from the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can cut down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of new snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) road conditions become winter.
On Monday, Farmers Can Begin Annual Skincare
Schleswig-Holstein ’ s farmers are allowed to start their annual knee care on Monday.
The "green ramparts", unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for about 200 years.
The trees and shrubs, which are up to five metres wide, are "forest substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks link scattered habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are Living Fences
The Knicks were founded on a command of the Dane King Christian VI in 1766, which ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitation and cattle fence, they also supplied firewood and beams for their timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates from that time: the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop through "bending" the branches.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch, giving the picture of a rich, varied, structured landscape.
According to NABU, around 7000 species of animals now use them as a substitute living space.
Up to 1,800 different species could live in one kilometre of Knick and breed up to 30 bird pairs.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
In addition to its biodiversity, Ludwichowski said that it is becoming a thin tree that also loses the wind protection effect.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kneading may only be carried out outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia talks about local SITUATION.
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local radical Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport at Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something to accommodate other people.
Where do the people living on Sulawesi now stand?
Many have descended on surrounding hills, on which they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and the petrol stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners are free to walk around, and finding them is difficult.
There are still many corpses around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information provision work on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but it did not work before and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people, who do not know whether they live and where they are, because during the earthquakes people were not at home but on work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this??
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought 'okay, not a tsunami' - and then he came.
In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Ring not prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but that was the worst here.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and train evacuation.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, and the earthquake has affected a great many people.
Muscle Injuries Against Werder: VfB ’ s Long Abuse of Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
On Saturday, Aogo took a muscle fibre-break in the back left thigh at the 2: 1 against Werder Bremen, and the Bundesliga announced on Sunday.
In Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle fracture in the thighs.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss matches after the following national break.
VfB Stuttgart did not make a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle fracture usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fracture usually heals slightly faster.
The Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the film festival of San Sebastián closes the annual celebrations of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all of the movie ’ s songs, one can sum up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire brigade tried to capture a wounded duck.
However, the action took some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - walkers on the Olchinger See fell up on Sunday morning with a white injured duck.
She stayed at the water monitoring station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
But the first attempts to capture the ducks went wrong.
Despite the injury, it has been able to keep on evading the forces.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a rescue boat, the fire brigade could encircle the animal and push it back to land, where after almost an hour it was put into a transport box by a fire brigade with a courageous handle.
The duck injured at the breast was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But, according to initial estimates, their chances of survival are rather small.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard Peilt World Cup Medal
Biathlete Julian Eberhard was in the stomach for a long time.
This winter the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the lost precious metal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old person in the Pyeongchang Olympic Sprint the medal close to grabbing.
Seven tenths of a second failed to reach bronze.
"I have deliberately given myself time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
One medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it simply did not want to be.
The Pinzgauer is therefore all the more motivated to make up for the failed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to return with the constitution to a major event, to win something.
At some point you have to strike.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track to the heart", he is pleased to recall his fourth World Cup course in the single race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season he ran second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Investigation in Turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of proposed interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a razor-thin majority for the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set a Friday deadline for investigators to investigate alleged incidents over 30 years ago.
The recent turning point in the drama surrounding the appeal of Kavanaugh, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the jurist turned out angry tirades against opposition Democrats, the Senate Judicial Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative Justice in the US Supreme Court.
The Republican majority seemed certain when, contrary to his initial announcement, Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who referred to Thursday's harsh reprimands as' besess', initially abstained from further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of 'happiness in disaster'.
In this way, last doubt could be overcome, he said.
Later, in an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump ’ s FBI Investigation in Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
There will be a targeted investigation into the well-known accusations made by two women, but nothing more, as one government official told the Wall Street Journal: 'They are not going on a fishing trip'.
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality of Ried, the mobile radar unit installed in a "civil vehicle" is located on the garden road from Monday 1st October.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 After Victory Against Mainz: Feeling Fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
However, the factor of time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room, "said Schalke's Sports Board 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the royal blue still managed to finalise the close 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first season victory.
It could have been otherwise.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of chief coach Domenico Tedesco had made sure: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and from pressing".
Don ’ t Shape a Headball Monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was at the bank, I can understand that".
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore they were withdrawing further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who did not play an insignificant part in this with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst football player in the team".
But, in the end, only victory matters.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including, of course, in the case of Inglese.
"We wanted to start in the early stages and make a firework out of it," Schalke's chief coach said.
Victory was important.
At last we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes.
Perhaps the biggest shortcoming in the afternoon: royal blue missed to worry more about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the Latte 59 / 72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a lizard," said Temeco: "You have already felt fear a little.
I am therefore pleased that we have won.
So he was not the only shaker.
Fischbachau: Smoke Column in the Leitzach Valley 2 km visible
The smoke could not be overlooked.
A hiker in the Leitzach Valley observed a fire from about two kilometres away on Sunday at 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: an unknown person had set fire on a two square meter area at Gschwandner Berg Müll.
According to the police, he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the glow unattended.
And this is close to the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling up and unloading.
The police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: An equal discussion.
In front of them is the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have been trying to get interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffen" - the association that cooperates with the Alliance of Cultural Policy in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, hard numbers and a little joke, he brings one of the most conflictual themes closer to the audience: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are conflicts increasingly arising?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table, German society is sitting around the corner, and first generation migrants are sitting around the corner.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have their say.
This leads to conflict.
The decisive factor, therefore, is not whether one is politically right or left, but: 'Am I for or against an open society?', he stresses.
At first, the discussion round is getting more and more lively.
And there is room for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective that two teachers tell us how they see successful or not successful integration among students.
El-MaMaMaMaalani, not on stage, represents the discussion: it is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not express his opinion, stresses that he talks about the average, not about individual fates.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the subject, because 'only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions', says El-MaMaMapaalani.
During the following signing hour he was also open to the questions of the guests and was also discussed intensively in the foyer in the case of prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and Casting Winning Spike
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Basket Bonn ended the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an outsider victory.
Gießen fought against Central German BC in a hard-fought match in his own hall at 91: 84 (43: 46).
The ambitious Bonner won at the BG Göttingen with 86: 79 (49: 47).
The first table leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112: 55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, German champions Bayern Munich and former serial champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich was already struggling on Friday for a 83: 77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg at 84: 80.
Building in Landsmam: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the properties in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.
Mayor Roland Frick shares this.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 land plots offered by the municipality is completed at more favourable conditions or prices, similar to the previous one.
More than 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
"The documents are currently being checked" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieninger, the goal was to have prepared the list of candidates for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council.
Then the award can be made.
In total, the area in the south of Landsmam will create 50 plots of land for single and double houses, as well as four areas for multi-family houses with presumably eight units each.
The development is almost complete, and the roads and roads are to be paved in the near future.
An individual plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to one individual, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 free-state funded, income-based housing.
Space for 200 People
Grob estimated is created on the surface of the new building area Landsham-Süd housing for about 200 people.
Not only that: now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start is being made there for the construction of a new nursery.
There will be three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
That is how Schalke's Naldo 'Great Sport' also works at the Bank.
For the third time in a row not in the grid: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Domenico Tedesco at Schalke Trainer.
Gelsenkirchen - For the third time in a row Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues did not sit in the Schalker Startable but on the Exchange Bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the nearly two meter large Brazilian had really spoken the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle, as usual, after the 1: 0 victory over FSV Mainz 05, and the chief coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his pros, the 36 year-old, who everyone is easy to call Naldo, turned in and said: "We have to thank trainer!"
"This was very emotional, it was great sport," said Tedesco later about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reservist existence, had no resentment whatsoever.
Probalích knows that Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best shaker, has not really got on his coach's back - he gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "stress control".
It was not easy to tell him that.
"It was not easy to tell him that, I tell you quite honestly," said Tedesco from the moment he said to Naldo that he was not in the grid.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it is always about the thing, it is about the association ", founded Tedesco the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone is able to get through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, "explained Tedesco the rotation, which last also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving to be an exemplary team player at the bank.
The mood in Austria ’ s industry accelerated its decline compared to the eurozone in August.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low at 46.7 points.
In Europe, Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone PMI rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the 50 count mark for the 13th consecutive month, which suggests growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks were at the bottom (42.1 points).
In Germany, France, and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but more slowly than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level of 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened decline may mean that the worst is over," Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
But industry remains number one - at least in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone have fallen as fast as they have since November 2011.
Companies therefore lost jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
In China, too, industrial production fell sharply in August than was initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in sales, employment, camps and prices are highlighted.
Tuchel ’ s PSG team manages eighth victory in the eighth Liga game.
29 September 2018 at 19: 45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel hurts with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice the title defender won 3: 0 (1: 0) thanks to two hits from Superstar Neymar and was also successful in the eighth Liga game.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon in France made such a good start to the game time 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar took PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and finished the game.
Christopher Nkunku (46) was responsible for the intermediate 2: 0.
Paris also won the rehearsal for Wednesday ’ s groundbreaking second championship league match against Red Stern.
At the start of the premier class, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory defeat this season at 2: 3 in Liverpool.
