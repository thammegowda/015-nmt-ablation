Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city.
An error in which young people are supposed to meet today.
A pit chapel where the tunnel is now digging for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It nervt if maps are not current.
Everyone who has had to come up with this because the Auto-Navi, instead of a bypass road a green meadow.
The historical maps of the Bavarian Atlas digital Bayern-Atlas, an offer of the Geoportals of the State Government, are far from the moment - but it is very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the region of the Munich-based Merkur have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be recognized as such.
The large overview map has been used for cities and municipalities of more detailed maps, so-called opposition sheets.
This was due to the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and was the first surveying of Bayerns.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalitions War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical recording of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.
Even if French troops were finally withdrawn with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a universal Bayern-Karte.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographische Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library.
Compared to the former / Today, the state capital is the most impressive.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is subsendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was 21 years after the creation of the card, i.e. 1877, when Munich district was established.
Today, Untersendling is located in the heart of the city.
The houses Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today ’ s Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: when you zoom in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten corridors from the so-called "Uraufnahme", which was derived from the base tax.
Small parcels are no longer farmers here today - but small gardeners of the 'land in sun'.
A large green area is north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 was the venue of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow and not a concrete desert.
On the other hand, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the opposition sheet, one reads in the area of Au-Haidhausen, not only the street names "at the Gasteig" or from the height "on the Lüften" - but also in large letters ".
Yes, at the Auerfeldstraße, once people were locked up with madness.
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "at the Auer Lüften".
In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden, the establishment of the psychiatrist, who was involved in the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the anchor of the so-called error.
In addition, he has banned the personnel to apply violence against insults', Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has engaged in an exhibition with the talt.
For 280 patients it was first place, and later it was extended to 500 seats.
At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for building the circle irrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrists in Germany.
At the end of the former Auer Anstalt, young people in Munich Salesianum.
The Orden acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training enterprises.
Westlich lies the football pitch of TSV Munich Ost, east residential houses from the 1980 ’ s.
In 2015, the children house "Casa Don Bosco", built in architectural style with the original building of the irony of the irritation that had been destroyed during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was named "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allied rissen in December 1944 many holes in the city centre.
A big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 of the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn-Stammstrecke.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at Marienhof.
Citizens' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association to promote color color has issued a warning for colorful people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State to Missouri.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri, which will enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to travel through the state, and to take extreme caution, since a series of dubious race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state, and this is stated in the opinion of the group.
A recent law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that disproportionately targeted minorities, led the group said NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that people pass.
They are beaten or killed because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard."
It is the first such warning that the organization issued to a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline and was taken by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of being accused.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General Public Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that black drivers will be kept 75% more frequently than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware of and their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri said Chapel.
"People must be prepared to know whether there is money or leave the relatives know that they travel through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI report, which classifies the state in terms of the number of such breaches to the country ’ s 16th rank.
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, having adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigrant offences, which, in the opinion of ACLU will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently lobbies have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary.
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU parliament, Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on the ground.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-placards together with mayors Thomas Schneider and the two Members.
Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into its operation, in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, as well as many young animals and five apartments holiday guests.,,,.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests is exclusively regional.
Since he is also known as BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaunprojekt as "elementar important".
I cannot run into such steep areas.
Green land care for a lot of work, much needs to be done with the engine sense.
"We are dealing with the conditions and with topography", emphasized Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead to a bio-operation.
For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "The Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunproject project and is glad about the Leader-promoting".
At the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of land could still be extended.
"The biggest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operation", stressed the mayor.
Farmers are often criticised for promoting criticism.
In 2013, 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced.
The open area is 40 hectares, which must not be explored until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half over Leader, a quarter of the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, farmers spend 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of Weidezaun.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences", explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: "She does a good job, without farmers and rural women are not '.
For Peter Weiß stand firm: "Here the best food is produced".
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state support for Weidezäunen.
The aim is to open the Black Forest.
The precondition is the existence of a conveyor by the LPR.
In addition, the area must not be tradable (hemisphere over 35%) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the request of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build up just 16 kilometres of fence.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump ’ s Freedom Statue
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate them as well as any other, so carefully staged overthrow Saddam Hussein ’ s place in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he did a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President ’ s proposals to drastic restrictions on legal immigration.
To stay fair, Miller did not use the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty-beekeepers would have lied him if he had done it.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the importance that was attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the memor.
When Miller Acosta, "I do not want to go into a complete thing about history, but the statue is a symbol of American freedom that the world enlightened.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original freedom statue. '
Miller is correct, but as he himself said, it is not really about history.
It is about contemporary resonance on the winding words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not just invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: 'Your mosquito, your poor, / your poor, / your crowded masses, who yearn to breathe, / elding waste of your rich coasts.'
There was never a time when the "elende waste" on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US.
This conflict because of the importance of statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance.
Lazarus - and their friends who set themselves to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they carried out a highly political act.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by showing them in a well-used classic visual depiction of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice.
And she gives herself another name: mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of statue, people wanted to change from the right wing.
The great horror as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for coming from Trump, argued in 2010 that the statue is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives that the American flame into the world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.
It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to go down the road to the United States. '
Limbaugh is usually unusual.
The importance of statue is completely and even a question of the position of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were by the exhausted, elding, but hopeful people after long and often dreadful travel on the deck of ships.
It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of goodwill they have to hear.
And that is, of course, not the prospect that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to enlighten, but hatred, who is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black lobt Scottish members of the UK team.
Eilidh Doyle reminds of a time when only two Scots were part of Britain ’ s team.
The UK ’ s performance director of athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team '.
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "developing something special in Scotland" and the lightweight athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something.
"We welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find it out, 'said Black.
"I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type of street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are Medaillen-Anwarmter, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who are against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain speech was incredible ", says Black.
"A series of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that the Eilidh was very natural.
The Commonwealth silver medals, who are in their fifth World Championships at the 400-m-Hürden, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland has been the best total number of athletes in the World Cup in 1983 and 2015.
The medium-haul rider Muir leads on this road and has established five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners.
Chris O'Hare, who is running 1,500 m, is another Scot, who was looking for a great season that followed the victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championships, when the only other Scots in Team Lee McConnell.
Mannschafts-Kapitänin says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with medals and finals.
"The special feature of Team-Kapitänin is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was always a great honour, but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me, makes it something very special for me", added it.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It shows just how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise on podiums.
As regards my speech as captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home World Cup.
It is therefore really important to put this home support and benefit from the fact that we are again in the Olympiastadion.
I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will simply be a great atmosphere outside. '
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not worry about a public office if you don ’ t have a public office if you don ’ t have to sign up for voters ’ approval.
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not long until the newspapers took him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He shifted in criticism, safe.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said: 'Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid and stupid, we shall be waged as sheep.'
This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.
That is why the American Civil Liberties Union dismissed him early this week.
The staff of the governor left the complaint as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?".
"It is only Facebook", said many people.
But it is important.
And it is particularly important if it is a type like hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzkopf.
He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very cleverly to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debut his haarless head to chemotherapy on his side.
That is why blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is called officially and is paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse, the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hatched people online.
The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a parish, no troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans ’ Catholic faith.
Lashmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserly filled, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I commented courteous that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the news post "The Post".
"I do not value this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they will be disregarded by some rather rather than a large group of citizens affected '.
What the employees of the governor called "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call "advocacy".
The Facebook-era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and arrest newspapers with critical guideline or to silence protesters and silence protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening in digital.
Hogan is not the first public officials criticized for having Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is scaled by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US District judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when she appointed a facebooks page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymously letters sworn on his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyme like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain, were overwhelmed by the George Washington Project Online Papers.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are part of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club.
Former Europeans No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for the next three days, because the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the.
The Northern Ireland, which last year led to the final round before he lost Paul Eales lost, is connected with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.

"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry has made a great job when he found this place.
He is an eager advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course. '
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship, even though he won his 32-year career both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour.

"I won't be able to defend Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories come back last year, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a very special time and one we will always appreciate. '
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to the European Senior Tour, returns.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home", said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also notice this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf.
I am glad about how it has gone. '
With the Trio on the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.

Less lung cancer tote through Passivrauchen
Over the past two decades, fewer people have died because of passive smoking smoking.
This result is scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking," said Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject of 1994.
At that time there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Households are very complex.
The construction works in the Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are reasonably in the time", so the head of the Bauhofs Fred Heinze.
In the area of domestic connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, because the underground is much hidden in the plans.
Transport, which is constantly hampering construction works, represents a major problem for the construction of the Stumpp company.
"The ignorance of drivers before red amples and locks are already huge", says Heinze.
The road is closed and only the buses are entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were wonderful.
But fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water ", says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cook the dinner, she uses no herd.
It rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai, the capital of the Paniai province in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually uses a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the bonded nose is absorbed with oily, unwashed hands and wasted.
Degei sits on the Lehmboden - she does not have furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, such as clothes with sinister water from the nearby swamp.
An oak in a dachless space serves as a Latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of their husband, no fields were assigned.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late can be dangerous: most villages are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to go around after 17 o'clock in the village," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was introduced in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders should vote.
An existing movement that stirred up for independence against Dutch rule, quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which prohibits foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is as remote as it is öde.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and made of shallow roofs that were converted into various yellow brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans a God named Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We were not used to wear this clothes," says Degei and hints on their lively, hand-woven turban, their dark shirt and bright rock.
"We had only leaves to our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia ’ s Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has reduced $3.1 billion of gold and copper.
Moreover, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of timber resources.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia ’ s powerful military presence is preserved.
An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport local military officers and units paid nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papua demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gangs and are treated without mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua ’ s tribal eshochland in the 1970s, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We Will Everything Loss" says in a report by Erzdiözese Brisbane from 2016, in which reports on atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, since every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian leaders for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased because Papua ’ s resources provide an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing, as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung-Kantinen sell fried chicken and Gado, a mixed vegetables with earthnusssauce.
Local people are fighting for here.
"The migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai locals who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It was the native Papua - the Mama Mama [women] of Papua - their market.
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and violations of the law in Papua in 2014.
Former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua has changed little, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts have broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored", says You.
Indeed, Paniai suffered only two months after Jokowis inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children out and sang Christmas lieder in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers were on a motorcycle through darkness.
The shocked children told them that they should turn their spotlights on.
One of the soldiers took impetus to her tone and came back with four soldiers, so the local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk, hunt and swallowed the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so hard that he fell into Koma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and the things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered together at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commissioner centre to demand justice.
They made ceremonial hunting arches and led the Waita dance - in the circle and a bird singing imitating - from Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm.
Some demonstrators began to slow down police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldier sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses more than three times resistance, they shoot them dead", it is said in an official document from TIME, which did not release the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto-quarter of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home.
Nobody was listening to the mood.
"When I turned around, I suddenly became shocked into my left hand hand bag," he said TIME on the veranda of his bunt painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who has fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired", adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, the witness of the shooting.
"I ran to him and investigated his body to make sure that he was", said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name, the TIME in gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I knew him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers wanted to secure their station only "because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It is about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
The news about the killings came only after Jakarta.
Three weeks, Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore, to address the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism for settling historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000 years.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to go through, 'he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he did not have plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, 'everything is regulated by law', he said.
Wiranto, who accused the UN for 'crimes against humanity', who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of Paniai victims took such claims with grimmy disbelief.
"I was interviewed four times over the last three years, but there was no progress', says Yohanes.
"I am tired."
He says that he still lives in fear for years.
"I am afraid" he says.
"I am afraid to be arrested by the military, fear of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After having buried the bodies, the military looked for me" he says.
The shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police took place in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to hospital, a person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he caught in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Ordered villagers protested in front of the company ’ s location office.
The police said that the villagers fired stones on officers who responded by firearms.
But locals say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the crowd and killed a killed.
"We were so in panic, we fear that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly received, so the TIME.
"I hid myself two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers to account and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the area.
Paniai was always a disgrace for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by encouraging sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken in custody, on the pretext of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some are never appearing again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as beyond reach.
The people here build everything they eat: especially Nota and fruit and bubble vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweeteners.
They retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region are usually addressed to the better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have capital or the skills needed to make their own businesses competitive.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money", says John Gobai, the chairman of Paniai tribe.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, even though the rare permission to films.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asian director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis ’ s campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled provinces of Papua and Westpapua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Mangeling press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government largely confined to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Salomonen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council, the 'various and widespread injuries' in Papua including Paniai chießerei.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights'.
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited her silence and afflicted him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the sitting, but would remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai committees," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi knows that the Paniai people, apart from the constant threat of a predatory military lives, is in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai sailors, like other Papua, look at their vote for Jokowi as a 'guilt' that he must pay.
"They do not need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the Paniai families led a last symbolic act of the Trotses: the body of a victim was buried on a site precisely opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they will never have justice, but at least they do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed", says Yacobus with a sinked head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' Wolkenkratzer from Dubai for the second time.
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents from the 337 meters high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire, which, in just two years, is called the Torch-Tower (Fackel-Turm).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We have been lazy and we have stood up in the fire alarm and the horrors of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor, "a resident who told his name as George angab, Reuters.
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fire-fighting units were fired at 4.00 p.m. local time (00.00 GMT) fired the fire and the building cooled..,.,...,..
The government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive the safety of materials used in external areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation through the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage caused by the clothing, exterior clothing to decoration or isolation.
In Britain, the police said they believe that the system of plates of isolation and clothing at the London Grenfell-tower in June, contributed to the rapid spread of a fire, where about 80 people died.
No Davis-Cup-Reform: Continuing Best-of-five.
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has fallen through its large Davis-Cup-Coup Coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for Davis-Cup-Individual was only supported by two thirds majority.
This is often very long, but that is why very esteemed five-class classics remain in the tradition.
63.54% of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, the aim of ITF President David Haggerty was scarce.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the whole package of reform for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical contests, "said Haggerty.
We will continue to work to improve the evaluation.
Not until the vote was taken after many inconsistencies, the proposal to put the final to a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will be in the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc, and the players will have to take less official media appointments.
More than 1 of 5 US travellers brings banned items into the plane, a poll will find out a.
A survey carried out by air passengers that more than 20% consciously or unconsciously banned items from the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6% that the aircraft was accidentally banned, while they accidentally prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1% claimed that they had been belatedly discovered that they were irritated with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey carried out by more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules.
The respondents admitted that they tried to fly with something that was banned by TSA were 19.7% Millennium, compared to less than 15% that members of the generation X.
The most common items on TSA agents intentionally were food and liquids.
More than 3% reported, knowingly items with blades through security control, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately banned banned drugs.
The company said that it consulted travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled smuggled goods by airport security and how many would have done deliberately.
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to wear smugglers - knowingly or ignorant - by the security, those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are rather complicated and confusing.
People are often insecure what liquids they may take or how much of it.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of the TSA confiscated items are banned.
For a while, people thought TSA could look at books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk is no matter: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order.
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk are happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
In doing so far, he has failed to make a reservation for a part of the customer ’ s non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphal figures on sales and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk, at the announcement of the recent quarterly balance sheet, another less glance figure: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk had often sold more than 500,000 preliminary orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits that 63,000 pre-orders have been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is simply non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will refund the 1000 Euros (in the US $1000 and in the United Kingdom) "Reservation Payment".
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk placed in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders to the problem, the Tesla bo.
His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018, all models should be merged - 500,000, 2020 one million.
Demand is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect to be delivered at the latest in the second half of 2018.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are more delays, the inadequacy of reservations could become the problem for Tesla.
After all, the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from proceeding in Scharen.
EPA Chef Pruitt withdraws from the Obama administration ’ s rules to reduce emissions.
Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, decided to delay its previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions Smog.
Pruitt presented the change when its agency was responding to the needs of state environmental authorities to respond faster than previous administrations.
He did not mention the proceedings against his previous post in a federal court.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for bodennahes ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to prevent "interfering in local decisions or to hamper economic growth".
Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitt regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In an opinion published on Wednesday, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn in Ozonstandards quite simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation, and then waited for activists and others, and in an agreement, to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, which allowed EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
'We do not believe in regulation by judicial procedures and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority that we are serious. '
Nevertheless, the opinion of the EPA said that Pruitt will eventually use its "power to delay and any other legally available powers' to ensure that the rules are based on sound policy and the best available information '.
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft legislation approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that EPA held this week, said that the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.
"The reversal of EPA - after our complaints - is an important benefit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog in their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere.
The emerging smog can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people, and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered over Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it needs to take this reasonable step from those responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump administration, to become polluters and their special interests'.
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church of St. Hilarius..,.
750 years St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche church, the old cemetery in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m..
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius is a popular place to stay.
Visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
Saving and preserving the oldest building in the place have made friends and promoters Tumlingens to their concerns.
Walter Martini stresses: "It is a unique dörfliches Kleinod".
In 1267, St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergian Urkundenbook book: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the" ".
The text of the document was on the Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, a stately courtyard, which belonged to the church or the patron saint and not vice versa.
People there were people there.
As shown in the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which is still visible today in the village image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the dominant settlement centre of the village.
Old maps from the time around the year 1600..
The patronage law originated from the early medieval own church law.
A Lord who built up a church, and filled with a parish, remained the owner of this church and could inherit.
This was the right to use a parish or to propose a new parish.
Three old buildings were built in the church and two bells on the tower.
The Greater of the two crushed Christmas 1673.
The newly acclaimed bell glock was the first time in 1692, but later in World War II in 1942.
In the 30-year War (1616 to 1648), the windows were captured and stolen ropes.
The roof was undicht.
In 1796, French troops moved near the church.
They brake the law and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
In 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof was also the last resting unit for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche.
Only the Kirchturm was left.
In the New Year ’ s snacht 1834, a storm left the Kirchturm and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was broken.
Only the turmzwerg remained a witness of the 750 years old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen pensioners" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.
As organisers invite friends and promoters Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth Serenade in the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.
The combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium of Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Present Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Decree from 3: 30 pm.
A trunk will take place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view of meadows to the forest, the organizers will reveal the fantastic views.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and promoters Tumlingens feel particularly committed to the home care, such as Serenade-organizer Walter Martini.
Verein wants to check windmills.
"Boisheim defends" does not provide a legal basis for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim defends Andreas Coenen (CDU) asked to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheim Nette.
It is illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 could not have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time of fours, only at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind power plants are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are supposed to prevent a "parish" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had a few days before a change in land use planning a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but the district government did not approve of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of planning law, the authorization certificate is still unlawful and, therefore," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim defends itself".
The current state of affairs: the City Council decided to re-open the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This means that the granting of approval for the construction of wind power plants is legally excluded '.
The circle confirms the entrance of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received in the circle of Viersen since last week," declared a spokesman.
The circle is taking it into consideration the matter again.
However, they probably do not result in stopping the procedure.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle did not want to comment on the content of the association "Boisheim defends".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW Re, is planning to build four per 200 metres.

NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersens Stadtrat gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen, as well as participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg district.

City and traders plan "home shoots" weekends ".
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the city in September.
The trade association and city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to the shopping bummel into the city centre.
As the Chairman of the Commercial Association, Christian König, announced, the "Home Shoppers" weekends customers sensitize what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket commodity.
It is therefore a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.

Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
Furthermore, customer potential should be re-opened or re-opened.
This includes guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost the city centre of shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to reviving the city centre - up to landlords, businesses around the city and clubs.
It had to overcome the lethargy, which partly spread spread, had said in spring.
Birgit Strike, Head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen told that the third "home shop" day, five Thuringia cities.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.

Trump continued after leaked transcripts from telephone calls Mexico under pressure for payment of the border wall wall wall payments.
Transcriptions of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump called for a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall wall.
The US President accused him of publicly denouncing the wall, saying he said: 'You cannot tell the press.
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US, and swore Mexico for the project.
Transkripte of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees emigrated to Australia, is "ridiculous", "dumb" and "stupid" and "stupid" and that the existence of trade that the Obama administration had proposed would look like a "depp" after he proposed a ban on resettlement of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr Turnbull, "that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford-Massaker: Activists run racist Lynchakt as a call for justice to be restored to justice.
Ford Mercury was born in 1948 by a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumped on the.
Before the car had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns to block his way.
The leader of the Mob - a middle-age man in a needle strike - took a long train of his cigar and looked looked at the windscreen.
Drinks float inside fear.
"We want these n ---- r Roger!" Broken the man.
"Hol him from the car!"
Schreie torn the silence when a young black man was torn apart by the front-passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July is only a reflection.
But if a noose around the neck of "Roger" is thrown, almost all in the public.
Since 2005, civil rights activists moved to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night, where two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, George and Mae Murray Dorsey - from Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
Nobody has ever been accused of murder.
"It is truly incomprehensible that no single person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organise the follow-up.
"It is a jewel on a history, but it is a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights.
It serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want to end, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice, 'he said.
"We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A court practitioner puts a beggar about the suffering of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchens on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from monroe and the surrounding counties in the Lynchprocess.
But none has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights activists say that dual motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the election campaign in the.
Around the same time as the election stach according to the FBI, the black farmers Roger Malcom had a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumors in the city was that Hester had with Malcoms Mrs Dorothy and that the baby she did not come from her husband.
On 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, $600 to release Malcom from prison, the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved from prison and Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob moved the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison, who prepared and ordered the murders", concludes a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the murders, evinced and the identity of witnesses'.
Brooks makes it even more concise.
"It was an electoral massacre", he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and when you vote, you will pass it here. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual rendition of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.
Their presentation is clear, seized and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many people want to believe that it does not exist in America.
It is difficult to look, and even more difficult, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We do not want to talk about the Lynchen, because we are then faced with the hardness of all of us', she said.
"But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done '.
The samples for this year ’ s production began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors – a dozen white and the rest of Schwarze - into a space and laughed, when Greene launched a well thought-out overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is co-director.
He has played the role of Chief Clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I am not so", said Marbaugh.
"But I think it is very important to preserve this history because we do not want to return to these times'.
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The piece begins with Malcom, the hester and afflicts him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said n --- he disappears of my property!"
Rascona awakens the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) in laughter.
Greene lautest.
"What?", asked Rascona.
It is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No", said Greene, still kichernd.
"I simply do not think white people then 'n --- he said'.
"But", witzelte one of the other black characters.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'.
And precisely because the energy shifts in space, a sense of camera replaces the unease.
Everyone is concerned to get this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time when Rascona says the N word, he says it strongly and emphatically.
No one laughs.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There are horrors, shots and then silence.
A woman with a mourning sadness is above the bodies of actors and performs Billie Holidays mourning praise "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen viewers welding and tears from the eyes.
The audience is divided between black and white.
A couple is from Ithaca, New York, enriched to see the performance, many come just down the street.
They have experienced all almost eight hours of Georgia ’ s crushing moisture when Brooks travels to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now when you stand on the same country where the Lynch-murders took place, the air feels is mirrored.
When the last notes of the song, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children hock on their heads, register the falsified blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other.
"They are not really dead", murmelt a small boy when he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes greens the crowd - and suddenly it is over.
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw umarmt Marbaugh, the man who played the Clanmember.
Nick Rascona umarmt two of his fellow players, and then breaks down in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance of.
"It is okay", whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You have done that for one reason. '
Later, the audience met with actors for dinner.
At a table, a white pair of Atlanta, stimulates the posture with a black pair that they have just got to know..,,,,.,,..,,,.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words, what feeling has left behind.
"It is difficult to listen to these terrible words and deeds... from people who look like you and who do so because they look like you", said them.
"What that really does with me is that Lynchen still goes on," she added, "she added," today the only police officer. "
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks's court, he isst and recalls civil rights.
He said he started planning next year.
"The translation is somewhat inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning", he said.
"It is so if we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again.

They work in their volunteer year in several places.
Where anywhere?
Lots: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I helfe here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I also worked on the open day of school.

A lot: I am not the type.
It is an area that gives a lot.
Much love, friendliness.

EPA returns decision to delay the Smog-Rule to delay the Smog-..
The US Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, which states that states are obliged to curb the smog emissions, a day after 15 states expelled the Agency for the step.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to press ahead with the so-called 'ozone rules 2015', and said it shows the Agency's commitment to work with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners," said EPA-Chef Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced the intention of the EPA to measure the ozone rules - in which part of the country, pollutants should be measured in order to establish stricter air quality standards - by one year by October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, together with the Colombian district, said on Tuesday, that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to retract a wide range of environmental requirements that former President Barack Obama has imposed on former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump should boost economic growth.
But efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the breathing of air that ozone contains "lung function and increase the respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Community space
In the end, the decision was clear: two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winroots decided to set up a Community area in the future seniors.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing property, the mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
While it is still going to take place until now the parish community belongs to the community, there is no planning hindrance for the project to be stamped out by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area of about 55 square meters and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council is proposing that such a Community area should not be seen as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the senioren-just housing, but open to the community.
As an example, the word from the "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision will be taken by means of funding for the current budget already last autumn.
The construction is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a Community area would be reported, Tjaden, with 60% of 30%.
The proposal for a decision to signal the investor that, in this respect, it does not want to throw a knee between the legs, the assertion that both Sattel- - which is based on the environment - as well as Pultdach - which will reduce the grape height and allow the construction of economic power.
Not only does Wilfried Sohmer, is this addition.
If it helps: unanimity, it will happen.
It is not as simple as the Community area.
Daniela ’ s reputation refers to the many buildings with which you are not making the most of them, but they are now in the Community area, they say: 'I am difficult to do so'.
Yvonne Staiger speaks in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against local participation.
It sees a hidden subsidy to wealthy wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because the acquisition of the area, there is no grant, but a real, in the case of doubt, marketable value is the counterspeech.
Staigers's request to split up the proposal for a decision accordingly, there are three supporters.
Thus, the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarises in this way: "If we take the decision, we make a huge step forward in our infrastructure '.

In Harz from Stern to Stern
In Harz, the first "Starpath" will be created.
This plant is the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "Star Path" comes to the information needs of many Harzbesucher, said....
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up along the planned route and inform them about stars and stars.
In a first phase to 2018, the association "well-attainable installations in five to six places" in Oberharz.
Infrage kämen St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the table should be supplemented by the Internet.
This is why the location selection is a good mobile network reception.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later the Starpath Zug was extended by Zug.
"On the starpath, the viewer has a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars", the association.
Moreover, they learned why stars have different colors, or why stars have shifted more brighter than others, even though they are far away.
The star image will be a selected star and when he is best to see.
Since 2014, the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg, the most.
The location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with a mere eye.
In the Uni-Stadt region, there has been a similar approach to the planned starship project in Göttingen.
Beginning in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetenweg with its steels up to the Hainberg and the star warte - as well as an "extra-earthed" location in Diemarden (commune eques) with the planet Sedna.
The steels with the individual planets - including the planets degraded to the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth is shrinking into a ball of 6.5 millimeter diameter, while the exact 75 meters away, the sun.
The entire distance of the planetary route is approximately four kilometres.
While the light from sun to pluto sleep for about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than light in the world.
But the march to the next fixstern would take half a year.

Fortunas Hoffmann: "Dreierkette works better".
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2: 2 for the season starts against Braunschweig that optimisation of the defensive formation in Aue points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result that the first season game, Andre Hoffmann was not the two counter-tore at 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two counterparts too much, and we need to be careful in Aue even better," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge, the triangle should also be further optimized.
And a gateway after a release, the Fortunes will no longer be imagined.
"For the future, it will be so that no one will stand alongside Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope with the triangle of preparation than with the four-string string.
"I do not know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure that "because we are just in the triangle on the semiposts in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well build", said Hoffmann.
"precondition, but that we are even better harmonising and we do not make so many mistakes."
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"Whether you can speak after an unresolved startling start, you do not know.
The performance could well be okay, "said Hoffmann.
"However, if we are on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the pokal, we will certainly be able to speak of a regular seasonal season '.
That was not what his trainer wanted to know.
"The start in the season I judge only after six to eight days' days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not want to speak of an advantage against Aue, just because the game of Saxony had to be broken off at an early stage.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a bit more fresh, because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an uprising favorites in the bones.
"But they do not know so 100% of where they are currently standing," says the inner defenders of Fortuna.
The guests from the Rheinland as a lighter favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we have them away, only because we have the right to come under the first six, is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is only a defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga who must be beaten from the outset", explains Fortunas Chief coach coach.
"Such a statement would be arrogant and overly '.
And so, Funkel wants to see his players on Sunday.,.,..
New results from the Swedish Asylum Recent Test
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of the tested persons are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine (Councils) has started the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make an assessment of the age of some refugees after the Swedish migration authority (migratory verket) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were less years.
Up to now, migration has sent 6.880 cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were considered 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person "may be 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years old.
The tests are carried out only in cases where the person's age is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months.
"We do not see a big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said the magazine The Local..,..,.......
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied over their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "proposed that the person investigated was 18 years or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published, she found that in 243 of these cases the person openly said that she would be 18 years old.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-ray measurements of Weisheitszähnen and MRT recordings of knees, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska-Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they were sooner or later than usual by puberty.
"I had reason to think about this, and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot safely say it, we should not pretend that we should not pretend that.
However, Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests: "In general you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is incorrect.
The biggest risk is that if the person is under 18, in this case, this is about 10%. '
Full in the Plan
The works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven tons of heavy emphasis was placed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.

This is a peripheral fortification which is also used as an operating route.
On the southern part of the bridge should be used on Friday a 2.20 meter wide bridge bridge cap.
This will then be the pedestrian path.
The special thing is that this is a patent of Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with patented bridges.
Particular attention has been given to the design of the building in Lauterbach.
There is also a fibre optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project before the work was carried out by handzettel.,,.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished.

The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the deceased system ", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will start with the athletics World Championships starting on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria as neutral players.
The head of the IAAF Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Trauerakt for Mali crashed soldiers.
At a Trauerfeier in northern Hessischer Fritzlar, around 1000 people of the two helicopter absturz in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security precautions.
On the unresolved crash, Secretary of Defense Ursula said from the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She described the two pilots but as "Could their specialist".
"We hear the highest sacrifices that they have provided on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from northern hessen were killed on Wednesday a week in West African Mali.
Their sentences were transferred to Germany and were accompanied by a total guard of the Bundeswehr in the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At lunch first, only the members of the church took off.
After that, the Trauerfeier began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them, Hessens ’ Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Trauergäste settled Rosen, who loved Arm in Arm at the sargen.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Secretary of Defense of the Leyen referred to as' highly decorated soldiers' and experienced.
The Stabshauptmann had built the aircraft operation of the Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regime.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the Regiment, to which the soldiers belong, said: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, it would not have been possible".
Doubtless about the UN mission in Mali was not: the use is dangerous.
But it is also of great importance 'for a country which we are separated only by two states', she said.
After the ceremony, the halls were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik does not want any tomb next to his wife.
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be shadowed by his wife.
The King's house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish kings of the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already finished a sarcop for the two.
The Queen was in agreement with her husband's decision, it was further stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik begraben is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be appointed in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a hehl that he was not happy with his title.
After the throne's death in 1972, he would have liked to be king.
In 2016, he went to retire, and she also set the title "Prince gemahl".
As Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted, he can see himself as an equivalent - not after death, Lene Balleby declared, the chief speaker of the Danish king house.
Where the last retirement of the 83-year-old will ultimately be unclear.
However, he did not intend to be appointed in his French home, but in Denmark.
He may be the country for which he has worked for over the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde Monpezat, son of a French nobility, had met Margrethe 1965 in London.
He worked in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, Prince Henrik had a heavy state in his nearly 50 years of reign in Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "Few months after my arrival, everything I did.
My Danish was pregnant, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk socks instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, Tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I used instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of social critics, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
These were two mistakes! '
Prime Minister Because rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony.
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD), after the loss of rot-green government majority for a rapid re-election of land, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday, the resolution of Parliament spoke.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP from their country during the day group in Lower Saxony, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of land elections, the rot-green coalition in Hannover thus lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified their step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in their constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU", she explained it on Friday in Hanover.
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to include.
The CDU and FDP together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the rot-green government must now decide whether it can govern it without a majority in this situation.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the country's day to adopt its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday.
The country ’ s constitution also provides the opportunity for the Prime Minister to choose the country ’ s day.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These options must be properly checked ', said Thümler.
'One will discuss all the questions if they are legally reasonable. '
Thümler called Twelve Step "but something curios".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a betrayal.
I feel very good '.
She described herself as an attachment of black green.
The Greens called for the dissenters to return their country ’ s daily mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she has received her country-office mandates with immediate effect," returned the country leader Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The group chairmen of the Green Anja Piel said: 'We regret the decision by Elke Twesten extraordinarily'.
You have deliberately chosen not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the surrender of the Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate, but also betrayal of Red Green," the German Federal Head of Social Democrats on Friday.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the country day.
The exit Twelve in Lower Saxony will cost the majority.
The politician "in her wounded oath and in her frustration, her personal interests against the welfare of the country," SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is scandalous that the CDU in Niedersachsen this dirty intrigenspiel and tries to capitalise on it.
Lower Saxony CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his Members to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, warf Twesten, with personal career gifts, the outcome of the 2013 election.
The CDU was the strongest force, SPD, and Green had had a very thin majority of one vote in the country.
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoners, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the Eier-Chargen concerned.
Those affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all, what we are now aware, there is a health hazard is practically excluded.
Aldi is now taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the educator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the task of the federal countries.
Nevertheless, my house has been swinged and has been in close cooperation with the authorities of the countries concerned.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade has, just as manufacturers, to ensure that the products sold are safe and healthy.
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded, these are not accessible.
Uncontaminated eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time is not the fault of farms.
Seat production plants and consumers on the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production companies do not directly blame.
Instead, they must expect economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there is too little inspectors in the event of serious cases.
Is it not only the staff or the consistent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that have revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that we need a consistent clarification of such events and the transfer of public prosecutors in cases where offences can be found.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the competent authorities to have a full enlightenment..
Is the regular alarm in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain safe and viable food.
If an insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The proposed means that manufacturers, dealers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of food suppliers is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be consistent and working on all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the situation is speedily and unresolved.
How the financial rules of the Football affect Neymars move to Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars ’ World Record Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Somewhat consequences will be for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organisation that monitored the European game has monitored the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champions-League tournament.
Financial fair play rules that were launched in 2011 by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without large losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian from his contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loosely so that Neymar is signing and bringing it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the wealthy ruler family of Qatar.
clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must be subject to legitimate revenue sources that enable them to break the Break-Even point in their football.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to UEFA president in 2007.
Former French player believed that clubs who had taken huge debts in their pursuit of success, were effectively cheated and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.
The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs up to 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million.
And, while Platini ’ s presidency fell into disgrace in 2015, his UEFA ’ s successor Aleksander Ceferin continued to deter excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the billing over the duration of its contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the proceeds can be expelled for the next five years to the tune of EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions-League season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by making their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship of the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar about payments from the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar WMambassadors will be easy to find out that Neymar WM ambassadors will simply find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, told the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros a profit of more than EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year must be published.
PSG expects Neymars to be a blessing for sponsoring Deals, Merchandising and Trikotsales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily newspaper AS regarding Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports team, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"Once a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country. '

The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to "Northwest Swiss" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros-Tochter achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: for a shoggihersteller it is a prestigious order.

However, only Swiss manufacturers are coming into question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey seeks to renew the treaty beyond spring 2018.

athletics - Discussion Olympics winner Robert Harting achieves WM-Finale.
The triumphal World Champion on Saturday in the final round.
His brother Christoph, Olympiasieger of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup exclusion and could only look at the tribunals.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, the 65.13 meter long, for the final fight.
Nostalgie goes in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the Nische ".
This repetition of history is nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 1980s, for the 90-year Grunge era (when David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch-Komöden "The State" for MTV turned), and for itself - that is, for 2001 before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise feels it as if the time was short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking dose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By joining the core of the gag actors - middle-age actors play children who are grown up - they still have the impossibility of regaining the last part of the.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who are now playing adults is less emotional and his parody goes more after the poisoning of the "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character by an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy malignant plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillons Unterlippenbart of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old boy.
It is the moments of random madness that this Franchise could fuel like a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show how she will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East counterpart.
Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, created comedy with Rhys Thomas as director, is a filmed TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who for truth, atheism, and the path of Marxismus-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-pressed Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon Levitt.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to the image (the police spends the time to watch Chess on television, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find the voice.
But "Comrade Detective" is so much committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan-mask, is involved - that it often plays like one.
In six long episodes, the comedy is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was applied to a smaller length, could provide its Agitprop-Satire better, since Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who squeezed a bunch of Hamburg.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a good thing for a gelage.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we are even doing it with our own recent history and with its own.
Slap on Drug Mafia in the Land
The police was a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, the Schwarzwald-Baar circle, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart received numerous objects such as the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office of Konstanz on Friday.
15 accused of suspects were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and have already been issued against them.
In addition, officials ensured larger quantities of Marihuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros were safe.
Two people were arrested in Italy at the same time.
There was a German arrest warrant against the two suspects Italians.
The two are likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
More than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the Mafia is accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the prosecutor ’ s Office of Constance against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, there was a reger exchange and investigators of Cripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily.
That is why the large-scale deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
Ins Visier of the investigations were mainly Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian mafia.
Also a incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant, the bank's account.
In a way, large gaps in the foreign register register.
'Data of citizens who should not appear ': according to a report, according to a report, the external register in Germany has serious shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions on asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government ’ s refugee management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to major gaps in the country ’ s central register.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to serious misjudgments in asylum procedures and deportations' to some extent serious misdecisions', in an analysis that has been made by the Southern German newspaper.
According to the register, ten million people with foreign nationality, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained, data quality has not been good in parts.
In individual cases, data of 1921 have been found, "by people who have long been no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register '.
"Error data input can significantly slow return processes," says the report continues.
The statistics on emigration people are also covered by EU citizens who do not have to travel.
However, such false allocations led to a distorted debate on the handling of exit ', it is therefore said in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government seems to have begun to send refugee families with 16 years old children to Italy when they entered.
This goes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is implementing such procedures' for families with children - except for infants and infants - after Italy since 1 June 2017.
Since the end of 2014, practically no longer possible, the newspaper has been in reference to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU State to which they first achieve.
If a migrant goes to another EU country, this state can send it back to the entry country.
In order to justify the post, "In the meantime, the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy".
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), these commitments are sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin agreement.
The domestic political spokesman of the left-wing fraction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children threatened with the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system, and a threat to child welfare '.
Second best result achieved
In total, 220 litres of blood living in Oberreichenbach, the blood donation service has already been available for other people.
At least 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Jürgen Greule, who, with his now 100 donations, now divided 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, the community praises the community at the meeting of the county of the county to donate blood.
"It is genial how our body is designed and we pay respect to donate the donors who provide their blood for strangers, nor for their own sake", underlined mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the circle prepared by the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the preserves are divided into their components.
For example, three people could benefit from a blood donation.....,....,.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in the spring.
"In this year we reached 114 donors the second best result," said the DRK Circuit Manager.
Obviously, the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to a higher number of participants.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer to the multiple spenders and were awarded for 50 donated donations.,..
Half so many hired Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter ten times 500 milliliter of their life saft.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%.
The Bank of England is likely to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and slowdown in inflation.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain 'sluggish when it kept interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increased pressure.
The Bank ’ s policymakers (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to maintain interest rates to 0.25%, with less members this month increased, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase in support for.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation in the autumn is expected to rise to barely 3%.
But they signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to boost the inflation fueled by Brexit, saying that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammoth economic package, which was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will be time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide GBP 15 billion more in this system - with GBP 115 billion.
minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecasting of MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on household incomes continues to consume consumption."
At interest rates, she repeated that 'some tightening of monetary policy' to cool inflation and a 'somewhat larger' scale than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
The Bank ’ s revised growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecast.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell following this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31, and fell 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
No change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have shrunk from rising expectations to an interest-rate hike, and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easy to recover after the Bank ’ s end of the year.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight salary increases, as tightening first is even worse before it becomes better.
It added that monetary policy cannot prevent income collapse in the coming years, but it added that wages will recover at the end of their three-year forecast 'clearly'.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will compensate some of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote, causing the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully achieve prices and the economy.
Before the Bank ’ s last ruling on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates, because inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers in July demanding an increase in 0.5%.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The Bank said that exceeds 2% in relation to its target of 2% is' entirely 'to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline of swap rates, the mortgage market will become more competitive again, as lenders are looking for shops and ending the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals and complete the new mortgages, and many with toll-free options and low rates will become increasingly popular. '
NHS (The National Health Service) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV Droge 10,000 people.
From September onwards, patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment.
NHS England announced that an early three-year study of preexpositionsprophylaxe (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection by around 86%, is now delivered by the health service over a first three-year study for 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeal last year confirmed a judgment by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite claiming that the local authorities should finance it.
NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens announced on Thursday that NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens called "important new intervention" while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and further clinics will follow in October until April 2018.
Preexpositionsprophylaxe (PrEP) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious risk.
PrEP before sex traffic means that just enough medicines are available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sex.
Those who come into question include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, suitable participants will be identified who agree with the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and are registered at a local doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local sex clinic.
The programme will £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as is targeted and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in which more than three decades of ongoing progress in tackling one of the greatest health challenges of humanity '.
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted at needy and vulnerable people, the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner that leads to improving many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. '
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country, and that nobody who has a risk to HIV has left.
Now that the PrEP-Testmedizin has been established, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people. '
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help us to bring about a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.
The great life live: the intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced herself from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Davor I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room", says Joanne.
"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.
I have been in love and made an offer on this day. '
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to reach the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauraum and an intermediate floor to make the most generous ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my request, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and creating a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were sewn together without having to bundle.
It was not just a question of building a simple platform, but to put steel in such a way that it had the right height. "" "" "".
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
Blended gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
On both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow him to work longer.
In the kitchen, mirror is like a window in another room.
At the entrance there are divided units for all cuttings and glasses of Joanne.
By exercising a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Closable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door door.
"A bit of engineering went there", explains Erfan of the stahlverstärkten, furnierten MDF door.
"It is counterproductive, so it is very easy to slip the door."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the land - or as your property is estimated", says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate broker will enter a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they managed to enlarge the floor and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home", says Erfan.
"You do not fall into the electric plug in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. '
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square metre number of somewhat standard into something quite astonishing.
Indeed, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it.
Brothers are fighting for a $500 million real estate empire.
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of the biggest real estate empire Victorias worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton -Football-club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets should be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers had 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.
The Westco family founded Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento apartments, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the city.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul as the main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
A court act says that this means that Colin property is worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The departments proposed by Colin proposed departments have left him with what I thought for the best objects", he wrote in 2015 in a first monstrous.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but it accuses Paul to administer some of incompetent.
In an early Affidavit that was tabled by Colin, he says he hope to settle the dispute.
"My Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs are rising, with hundreds of pages with monkeys, e-mails and reports by companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her hideous husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought milk bars and delicatesses from the late 1950s, and in the early 1970s.,,...
They used the security to buy Collingwood in the first jeans of the family.
Colin says that he began when he started "in my last years of the High School when Paul was a small child (about 10 years old)." "" ".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brethren before court", she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Luke Group, claiming that Mark was leaving the company $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars.
Both Lukas and Mark are said, Paul "said about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin has withheld a very long time, even though he was a former AFL member of the Board of Directors and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire.
Fairfax Media met Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really cannot say much 'because the case is before the courts.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and put our family names through the courts", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said and added that he would "still hope for a solution".
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the head on a more equal course.
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House of Staff, met a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House, on his first working day with senior officials, he was a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House who wanted to repair bad information that he wanted to repair.
Kelly said to the staff that information should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he had good information. '
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tell Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades - and now when he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If Trump ’ s candidacy for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of posts that were persuaded," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media account contains a constant praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit was ever under control is ridiculous.
Perhaps this campaign officials know something that we do not know – that Trump ’ s tweets would not have included more fuel without their intervention.
We will probably never learn about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If he has managed to keep his colleagues away from him several times, their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to move forward their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - quite deals with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to the President for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano can respond to negative press cuts, especially those with embarrassing leaks, and that he understands how they come from.
That is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the President malicious a printed copy of a article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocation Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief Staff of Staff Katie Walsh, "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence, or that he has voiced false accusations and has revoked them in the past..
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the Trump receives'.
How did this clone?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulse Self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult.
Most sought criminals receive mail from Europol's mail.
As the address is unknown, the aid of the population is expected and hoped for.
The police across Europe sends a message this summer (virtual) to dangerous criminals on the flight...
As the addresses of the sword criminals are naturally not known, references from the population are hoped and inherited.
Europol reported on Friday from the action that follows the 'EU Most Wanted' -Adventcalendar of winter.

Travellers are negotiating a grave and return to the 'Millionaire series' series' '.
Some of the wealthiest landowners of the West Midlands have once again negotiated with some determined travellers on war, who have negotiated a field before their mansions.
Travellers have their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull, called the "Millionärs series".
They have brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, without having been deterred by the Council in order to prevent their incidents.
The tactical group found a gap in defence systems and pushed their vehicles through a section which remained unhindered to find a way.
Dear residents have pushed the Council of Solihull, who said that it was' useless to deal with the problem '.
An anonymous resident said: "They went there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones on the passers-by.
The Council must indeed be forced to implement, as it was useless when dealing with the problem.
The travellers were moved there in May, and are now back again.
More came yesterday evening, probably more today. '
It added: 'The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common tax if the Council cannot even stop this. '
A resident who did not want to be mentioned, said: 'It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these traveller, only to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area. '
A spokesperson in the Council of Solihull said: "We are an unauthorized warehouse on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls.
To support our collection, it is very important that as many people as possible to register anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case. '
Waldhotel Luise is situated in Birkenhof.
The Waldhotel Luise is the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
Because with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH was lost on 13 April 2014, approximately 30 000 nights per year and also revenue from the Kurtaxe.
In the autumn of 2014, with a dramatic increase in the numbers of refugees arriving in the county office, the hotel building was offered as a collection of controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial at that time.
But, above all Freudenstadt Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interest at that time.
It should be right.
The Luisenhotels Group, with a business leader Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
The Hotel Luise, Luise Park, Luise Park, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, there has been a construction store for some time now and when you enter the house, it is clear how extensive renovation work is carried out.
The floors were removed, partially removed old bathtubs from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It is actually a nice hotel", says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area will be transformed, new windows.
Everything should become "nice close to the citizen, as Thomas Scherer has.
"We want to make a jewel."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities..
They do not want to be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but at an elevated inner city level.
The Waldhotel Luise with about 60 rooms, explains Scherer.
Both individual tourists, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, he has already conducted, so Scherer.
The city ’ s ideas are identical to those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
After the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define exactly.
Nearly one million euros, he expects.
The exterior installations are also placed on the front, which is already.
In an inner courtyard, a large terrace created by the restaurant, which is open to public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US Special Mediator sets Grand Jury a Grand Jury.
In the Russland-affair around US President Donald Trump, special mediator Robert Mueller, a so-called Grand Jury.
In recent weeks, the board has begun work, the Wall Street Journal wrote under appeal to people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified its investigations.
The sender CNN reported that there was already first invitations from the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time in 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation is intended to focus several men who acted in the election campaign as a Republican advisor.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Mediator Trump personally put the spotlight on whether the president might have hampered the judiciary.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether charges should be levied.
The Grand Jurys are therefore also referred to charges.
Most of them are switched on when they are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite people to join the European Union.
According to the CNN, submissions have already been issued, which revolve around Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to say that the report was called upon.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump ’ s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his damalier election campaign leader Paul Manafort.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening that Mueller will show that Mueller will not be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end in order to decide on a charge.
Nevertheless, the establishment of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, President on Thursday evening, a speech in West Virginia, used to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia history is a total invention," said Trump.
The issue gives democrats a chance to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.
However, they usually work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the special intermediary.
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not determined against the president.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed, it was stated in the declaration.
But Mueller was only used after Trump had taxed Comey.
As a result of this smokescreen, accusations against Trump, he has been accused of obstructing the judiciary.
Comey said in June to a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop investigating the investigation of the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation....
After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against special intermediaries and his employees.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special intermediary of Congress, such as Watergate affair, Mueller has resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be taxed by the President of the Justice Department.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of republican and democratic senators put forward laws on Thursday, which the special intermediaries could no longer be made redundant.
Antarctica: Gigantischer Eisberg drives the Antarctica.
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been solved by the Schelfeis of Berlin.
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
Over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of coloss treibe now to the north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted.
It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
It is not a threat to people.
To what extent climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear.
In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice cubes in the region, the US Research Centre for Snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this can be linked to global warming.
The Koloss now closed was part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It is thus growing ever further and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Northern this scourge was disturbed by wax and disrupt a few years ago.
A complete cheek is there, AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.
The Larsen-C Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge edge edge edge has never withdrawn as far as.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can be broken if at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea levels because they swim on the water and ice as much water as it is after melting itself.
However, the loss of the Schelfeise leads to the sea directly into the sea and much faster than before.
This may increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for monitoring Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is based on AWI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres, the fourth.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge of the free ocean.
It breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we do not know any direct link to climate change, the ice shield is now entering a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University.
"This is the most far-reaching retreat since the beginning of the records", he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will now grow or fall back in the long term, and perhaps his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: 'Our models say that it will be less stable'.
But that development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not return to climate change this gigantic iceberg has not fallen to climate change in recent decades, many ice cushions of the Antarctic Peninsula.
The Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The decline in temperature increases.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years, counting on the areas where temperature is fastest.
CDU wants Haustarif at the Staff
Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant posts, the CDU calls on the employer ’ s association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the circle day 41 new posts in administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have completed their first day of work.
The teachers seem to be very desirable.
Around 620 applications were recorded for the places this year.
Nevertheless, there is still a lack of staff to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently there are still 50 posts at Mettmann.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU wants to take the initiative in the circle day with the FDP and the UWG to take the initiative and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
The administration is intended to develop a concept for personnel development and personnel development '.
The aim is to cover not only short-term needs for professionals but to counteract the shortage of professionals, it is to be future-oriented.
The overall concept should be based on the inside and outside, concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, CDU, FDP and UWG.
That is already listening to a good approach.
The circle has to do with personnel problems that were not previously known.
Other cities attract good officials and employees, and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a genuine 'competition of public employers'.
There is a large number of employees who are sick or elderly from the service.
So it is time to act so that no more jobs remain unsettled.
But Klaus-Dieter peoples, group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion.
He recently raised the issue of a faustdicke surprise when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover and the other parties.
Peoples want to be reviewed to enable all the possibilities of leaving the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the local cities - want a house tariff ', so peoples.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay better to pay the employees and officials than it actually provides for the public service.
The salaries are currently prescribed, increases or more money only if you switch to a higher level that is based on professional years.
But the cycle ’ s tasks have grown ever more.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up where employees were concerned about the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Last but not least, the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy aggravates the tone of NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Minister of Home Affairs, Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turiner daily newspaper La Stampa.
Minni ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German Aid Organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations of the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that at the moment, we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," "". "." "" "." ".
"We can only judge all the accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation '.
The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is presumed that his crew will take snake migrants on board who are delivered directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can drive them back.
At least such a meeting, allegedly, only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coastguard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons, not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have been agreed to keep to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary, but acceptable, since they would not bring 'substantial changes or disability' of their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy, have fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Anstiege and Trials
Neun Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Outpost" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy Trials and sights.
There were three friendly guides for this.
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved a good starting point for tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
During hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It was followed by observation points, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the arrows of the woods and the layers.
There have always been longer increases, for which long trials were rewarded.
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the viewpoint of viewpoint, connected by "flowige" Trials and moderate rise.
On the last two days, many heights were again high.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shopping huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim breathe the Biker in the open-air inhalatory salvation Sole.
New city was also taxed.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 altitude meters, the group had met the Pfälzer forest from its best side - sporty and culturally -.
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga will equip itself for E-Sport Sport Sport.
Seat sports tars in the future before computer consoles, instead of being swept through wind and weather over the stadium?
The fact is that E-Sport has long become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages.
This has also recognized the first Bundesligaverein, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
At the beginning of 2015, VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and most recently the VfB Stuttgart, the middle of July established an e-sports department and two professionals for FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there are still a number of clubs on this train.
Next weekend, FIFA World Cup organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where Gamer.,....,.........
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium", says the 52-year-old.
And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be present on these markets more often than just once a year.
What is it about?
In the E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA at competitive level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And with Asienspielen 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly needed.
Ingo Froböse has also addressed the question for a long time.
For Professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because he is competent and has many biological and physical reactions, which can also be seen in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid reaction capability.
Professional gamers should be trained not only at the console, but also their bodies and respect their diet.
"The fitte player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming increasingly a topic".
Controls are difficult to carry out online games and in the scene the structures of classical sport.
The scientists highlight the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are on the international road, which is like a large global family, because there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth.
In 2016, Germany, EUR 50 million have been implemented, mainly through advertising, sponsorship, and large tournaments.
In three years, turnover is 130 million.
This is a little bit of EUR 2.4 billion in football league.
However, e-sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte-advisers.
International are many countries already.
Large markets are Asia and the US, where Ex-Basketball-player Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood-Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport has been introduced as a teaching box, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the football first-league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB-Board Röttgermann.
Only in nostalgia, and the old times are no longer enough today.

Michelle Carter for the texts, Conrad Roy for suicide, condemned to suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was condemned to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was sentenced in June because of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who died on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is unRoman.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free.
She was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered a mental illness.
In red hoses and a creamy coloured blouse, Carter da with tears in the eyes, with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and down eyes when it was condemned.
"Your actions have brought Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor's lawyer.
"They ended his life to make their own better.
She did not accept responsibility ', she said.
"She did not show any reue.
But Carters ’ lawyer said that it is a 'terrible circumstance that she totally deplores.
But Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find that their "age or maturity, or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions".
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy ’ s mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is' no day when I was not the loss of my beloved son.
I would like him to be proud of me and how I am going to work with all my pain, despite all my pain that we will be wearing for eternity with us, for his sisters'.
Roys sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was persecuted by the realization "that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother, or would be a.
"No longer this only person with whom I had since my birth every day, is a pain that I will always keep for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case drew national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that they encouraged him to end his life.
"Häng you, spring from a building, create yourself, I do not know, there are many ways', she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was in holiday with his family.
In the eyes of his suicide, she wrote: "You must do it, Conrad" and "Everything you need to turn the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter ’ s attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press.
The case has shared legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 because of the murder of her British fellow Member in Italy before she was released two years ago.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published in Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: learning from the new mini Lahm of FC Bayern Bayern München.
That Joshua Kimmich at the Audi Cup as captain, is no coincidence.
FC Bayern traut den Confed-Cup-Sieger won a big season - Extra motivation is not harmful.
Something was different on his place in the cabin, the Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the extra garment was very small.
But, as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups was not a Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer, he made his pledge to the arm.
"The trainer has not announced", told the Confed-Cup-winner after his first bet as Bayern-Kapitän.
Well, it could have been better than 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the Coach could also be interpreted.
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as the leader of youth players, debutants and especially from the holiday.
Sugar is distributed to those who want to hold a lot of confidence to those who want to keep up.
So, if you have become acquainted with the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "That is what you want as a player: responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old as a mini-Lahm was above the field.
Right, that is now its position, the white Binde did its rest.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this startup formation like those who can best take the hand.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unconscious force.
He had a look for the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal was not able to play his missing fitness (clapped scarcely); Renato Sanches to devil on the achievements of the Asia-trip (also only limited); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did so in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot.
After all, this was very good.
Süle ran beside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both agated sovereign.
Napoli Sturm was often difficult, and he also tried to win some time in the game construction.
His colleague Rudy gave us that the result 'was not as we hoped.
But he also showed a proper performance in the debut.
Gaming, Tempowechsel: "For this style I was also fetched".
How unpopulated this Bayern-world is still open to the new entrants.
Rudy, for example, gave not one or two, but certainly six or seven interviews.
Kimmich adopted a few crisp statements in the back of his new players.
There, he heard of Süle an interesting sentence: "What I've already noticed here.
With Bavaria you simply have to win every game ".
After all, he must no longer bring the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB Ladies

Austria ’ s best-known soccer soccer reported on Twitter and the ÖFB ladies.
The Bayern-Legionär is a club member of ÖFB captain in Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our Ladys.

Companies content with rheinland-Palatinate Minister: Economics praises Wissings Tempo Tempo.
It was often incomprehensible, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as the Eveline Lemke (Green), the Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Pfalz.
This shows more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V V question about a change in economic policy - at the same time the old ministers.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association Trierer Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, the Lemke allesamt blocked".
The biggest U-turn is NATO in infrastructure policy: The bridge connecting the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is in the country ’ s list of priorities.
This year, the ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 is supposed to be the right to..,....,......
A role in the country ’ s plans also plays the Western circumvention of Trier, which is the most urgent need of the Federal Traffic Trap Plan.
The aim is to take the route in December 2020, Ministerial speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a way to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier aims to increase the trend of the wine in the Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years.
In addition, Wissing is an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, the IHK.
The Handwerkskammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
In the meantime, a premium of EUR 1000 for the best championship exam and EUR 2500 if graduates are graduates within ten years after master training.
The house tax list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, there is a lack of facts to the country, and the staff required personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief chief executive of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to stop the Wissing in the country, there are only 29 jobs.
The IHK calls for more orders to external offices.
CDU group vize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million less in the preservation of national roads.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also the sobering of broadband in the country.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed net supply in an IHK survey only with the note 3.4.
They complain about rising Internet connections and breakdowns.
Ex-Minister for Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is now out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of the wind company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke on April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe, where, after four months of inconsistencies, they have already cleared the field.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a backlash against a backlash..
One day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said that it would offer the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that 'there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions', and thus related to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there were three million Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Europe to modify its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described companies as a call back.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with the rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But nitrogen oxides, diesel engines emitting are considered to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to neutralize systems for neutralizing diesel vehicles issued by diesel vehicles, also take up what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignoring the powerful auto-companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called final equipment that could regulate emissions when a car was tested, but in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of Volkswagen, others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in.
Former Manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused of having installed a system to deal with emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is disproportionate to Volkswagen.

Mordillos nolles and laughter against the suffering of suffering.
Mordillo was one of the most widely published cartoons, the nollennases of his characters are trademarks.
The Argentinians are still working on a film.
His message: laughter, 'because there is too much suffering in the world'.
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he suggested himself as a drawing for congratulations - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when in my job lost", he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his Cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again the artists of cities.
Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he is still sitting on the drawing table, almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plush tablets and watches continue to spread worldwide.
For six years he has been working on a drawing film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a Giraffe - Mordillos's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet feet feet.
For the first time, his figures in the 3D film, the 2019 on the cinema screen.
"I do not know exactly what they will say, it is strange for me", says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he focuses more on the TV series, which, as his original drawings, which are.
Lavender from Provence ’ s climate change threatens
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to drought and insects caused by drought, causing scientists and farmers who try to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The Lavendel in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has been much less rainy in spring, and in autumn much more.
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.
There is also a small Zikade, a microbacterium that transmits the dwarf, and in very dry weather, there are very many of them '.
And there is much at stake.
Lavendelöl is not only for holidaymakers, but it is.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ohren with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. '
The solutions that are taken into account include better distribution of water and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry.

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The workers of the weekly Riodoce usually meet their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the Sinaloa state by organised crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what is more secure: they should take their children with their office, who were in 2009 the aim of an attack with granates or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and building chairs.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from violence, and while throughout the country have accumulated, more journalists are growing: at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection, and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter, her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, even though his presence everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", depends on the façade of the Riodoce-building, two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-Shi.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmare, nightmare, paranoia.
Although a special office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
Like most thousands of murders who are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists ’ murders are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are unRoman, and even though the terrain is still more trivial.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop", he says.
"Until we know why we are mistrust all."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez issued the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He was only able to drive a few blocks far before his roter Toyota Corolla of two men, and.
The shooter drove in his car and damaged it near.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to move freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing to silence.
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa was one of the bloodiest battles in the country, because rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of ornamented two-storey mausoles for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for one minute that there is a state of 'calm' if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the fault that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman ’ s Söhnen.
This release may have annoyed the sons, suspected Gangma bought each copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosk.
The second mistake was to not force Valdez to force Valdez, after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country to its own security.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues believed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to create Riodoce and sold $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem", Bojorquez said.
With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising.
Reporters loved it to be able to publish hard examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in prosecuting the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I would like to live", he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life", he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You must take the task you as a journalist - either that or you play the shower.
I do not want to be asked: 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why did you not say what was going on?'
The Riodoce team missing Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who was able to curb the friend who was generous with armies and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
You trust your routine.
He would always wear his dog.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sitting on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love to be routine?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best they can do their job and stay alive.
"You don't like it if you are dealing with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret start-ups and landmarks.
"These things were not allowed", said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
His own instincts trust.
If it was wrong, it would be away.
The anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "Geruch is a sense that can be deceived... and then the matter with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, Sinaloa are no longer valid in Sinaloa, as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space in which the employees of Riodoce to security training, were suddenly no mobile phones allowed.
Draußen sought two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were instructed by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan.
Half in the cheerz, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belong to the 50% of the policemen who were the governor himself as a untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For the edition of this week, Riodoce has focused on three main stories.
There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the hometown of the governor.
And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Public Prosecutor ’ s office, a.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it was done, so caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who was registered to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all political levels.
Recently, several PRI-governors have been accused of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman a military incident.
Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez ’ s column would have considered the best informed source of abduction.
"We had already known what happened", Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slender body stature.
"Now all the channels of communication with our sources."
The Valdez office was devoted to storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporterin Miriam Ramirez snappte a few characters and went on the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become loudest by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on salaries and buildings.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
She has since been asking for it to be re-divided by the government because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a uniform society '.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug-gangs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces committed to organised crime under a cover.
The media Guardian Group "Articulo 19" has more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and officials.
"In Mexico, because they want you to die the mouth," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that supposedly signed by the Zeta Kartell: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte border state Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their own countries or even fled the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still observe the roads and seek dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, gives the drug trade frightens him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce on the citizen's stiff before the office and drank beer when all their phones began to summarise.
A number of shipyards with bandenriches and security forces near Mazatlan had 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of cartels in the region.
From the Bordstein edge they published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed next day.
Sirenen heulten near - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez warf a look at the policemen who kept guards to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid, they did not show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce had its traces.
"As you can only remember," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day when Javier was murdered, the interns me asked me to send them to the street."
Dinosaurier used Tarnung to soften his enemies.
At first glance it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible nose of a Canadian mining worker were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurier.
It was so good that they could even find that his glove skin was of Roman brewing - and they said they had something of a 'troubled past'.
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best preserved dinosaurier ever found, and one of the best dinosaur copies of the world".
The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His unbelievably well-preserved state has researchers who describe it as "truly remarkably" remarkably ".
According to National Geographic, the coated plant frescos is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rocks, and decided to look more closely.
The Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years trying to reveal the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth cleavage.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little with the eyes, you might almost believe that it has lazy," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosauriere.
Researchers found that this plant frescos, even though it is covered with armor and resembles a walled tank, probably by flesh dinosaurs.
The highly acclaimed Dinosaurier used a red and white target to hide predators and used a shield technique that is known as a counterfeiting technique, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed itself to mix better in its surroundings and to soften their enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have studied the wild animal and put it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumstechnician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours with care.
The astonishing conservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of firearms and armor over his body.
They discovered contershading, a common defense method in animal rich, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than their bottom.
Although contershading is customary, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is far from the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaurier was driven by enough pressure from meat eating dinosaurs, that evolution encouraged confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use contershades - think of Rehe, Zebras or belts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to real struggle for survival.
"Starkes Raubtier-behavior on a massive, heavily afflicted dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been", said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosauriers was red.
Scientists continue to study the animal on his life, including his conservative Darminus, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the Dinosaurier, when he died, went into a river and moved into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to go much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with conservative shoppers, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost as like in the early chalk time.
You don't need much imagination to use it to reconstruct it; if you only have a little with the eyes, you might almost believe that it is sleeping.
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, the earth.
Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his furious ancestors.
The Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta has been contaminated in the sea and in mum.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long peaks that were demanding by his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant frescoed by Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.
But the underwater treatment of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The hidden remains of this special specimens are so good that the skin remains still hollow panels along the Dinosaurier ’ s di.
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in Lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it.
Auctions of the skin still cover the hollow panels that bear the skull of the animal.
His right-hand front is on his side, his five fingers are upwards.
I can count on his sohle '.
In the storm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured persons injured, many injured persons.
Hefty accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Knapp 30 vehicles are included in a mass carambolage.
There are many injured, kilometres of congestion and suitcases.
On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carambolage around 20 people were injured.
According to the police figures, at 5.00 p.m. between the adjoining nobility and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, including trucks, inexpensive vehicles.
The exact number of injuries were not available at first.
It is easy to medium heavy injuries, said a police spokesman.
A great offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident point.
The A8 was completely closed to Munich.
In Munich, a 10-kilometre long backlog was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there was also a number of passengers on the opposite track to massive disabilities.
The fire brigade has noted the hallmarks of the vehicle lenker, who now have severe penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
It was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident..
Deutsche Bahn: Group testet "Comfort Check-in" comfort check-in ".
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing is hanging in the train and sleeps.
Or one is deepened into his work and has just a brilliant idea.
And then: pufff.
If the creator gets an ungentle or rides the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creator lose ticket control.
It is simply confirmed by mobile phones that you take their place and devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two tracks.
"If the offer is available,.
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other routes in Germany, "said a railway line.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train ticket devaluation without Schaffner.
However, in order to be able to use some of the conditions: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - which is already most passengers.
It is also necessary to buy the train, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticketing.
Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort check-in" works so: you rise in the train, calls his ticket under "My tickets".
For the test customers, a button for electronic devaluation.
The train attendants receive a message that passenger X is in train and has taken the seat Y.
When the train attendant at the ticket control, he knows that a passenger is already sitting there with an already devalu.
So we can continue to sleep, continue to stay silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use passengers.
"If you want to relax without ticket control through our train staff, check in the DB Navigator.
This makes it possible for passengers to make their travel time by train, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
If you are travelling by train, you will be aware that, in addition to delays and passages, you will be able to travel by train.
It is often the case that you do not have all the documents you need to upgrade online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the downside or large room and delays in control of their own tickets and the creator at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that is only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further numbers on the same route are not yet released.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scroll through Facebook on her phone.
She stolperte via a post from someone from the High School.
"The police has just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street", it was said there.
If no one else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah has been constantly on her timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis was killed by Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted an image of Browns ’ vibrant body that was broadcast on the street and would stay there four hours.
"This is wild", thought Ferrell at itself.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She left her mobile phone to return to Tweets on people to return to the Canfield-Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and by a man who claimed to be Browns's father who had a sign with the signature: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
They observed a live feed in which a policeman in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellenden dog.
In another video, she said, she secured a different policeman and shouted: "I will kill you... animals all."
"This is not customary," Ferrell recalled his statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we have used to call and which we can call it."
At this moment I felt pupil frost.
I was angry and crying. '
She booked a return flight and went home next day.
After landing at 23 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who had a flower dress and a crown, after Ferguson, spoke to Ferguson, the two who had a conversation that she had a lot of time before this morning » about black experience and black state «.
"You remember how I taught thee when black people have to fight for what they think?" reminded them of what they said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I could not take it ", said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
It must be aware and it must be brought up.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to get free to get rid of ourselves.
Even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not see any glaring racism, she is not unlike the next black women's child.
I feel that I would be doing a bad service to them away from it. '
The first station when it arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campsite when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.
Ferrell and her daughter joined a local businessman who made lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped communicate them to demonstrators.
Slowly began a new type of activism for Ferrell.
"My activism changed after 9 August total," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri St Louis.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. '
weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only "documenting what happened.
A question came Ferrell in sense: "Would you document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism has been fed by countless cases of people, often by white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently said in an interview: "We heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices did not centred and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death tractor.
His commitment brought Ferrell to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because I will be presented."
The aim was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life, as they love and marry her wife.
"I felt like naked", said Ferrell and laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be a certain degree of vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement that after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in senior positions have worn the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on various fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything '.
Folayan voted to say that "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who stirred this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because in a life of these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel your energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on the Becurrency for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration.
It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that it calls her home: "chaos".
However, she still clings to a vocals and she feels obliged to this memory since she went to the street three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. '
From "Dream" to "magnitude": TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery ".
The Bit Gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone, since the first presentation of 2009, the people in favour and opponents.
Kalt leaves the subject.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" will be discussed.
While one of the Bit Gallery say: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Do no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "magnitude!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters build a gallery more customers into the city, which also benefits the rest of business, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will blunt.
In addition, the gallery will be planned on the plot where the farm market hall stands where 13 direct marketing products offer their products.
The beginning of the construction work will end.
The gallery Macher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - for the Beda-square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying for many years almost weekly in the farm market hall.
Most of our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of rural women.
We have also discovered the metzgerei for ourselves.
We would like to see that even during and, above all, there is an opportunity to maintain this offer.
In other cities, this is also true.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting.
Gerd Densing: "Whether directly marketed in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of rent is coming to the height of the rental.
However, this should not be low in the new project. '
Eva Kilic: "Wozu Shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drought or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough in our city.
One can see how many retail shops are empty - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that we at least have the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is above price.
As you can see, retail shops in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the rents are often unsustainable for a retailer.
It is a pity that special deals are almost no longer and what remains of it will disappear. '
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not match me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all, where is the farm-market hall should go down?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term if the Bit Gallery actually comes.
Or does it create the specter Bit Gallery before selling all the shops from Bitburg? "
George Marquet: "This will simply not work.
And a shopping center that is empty, no one needs.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market rather than this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, thanks to the madness of many - as I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farm is broken, a piece of culture will disappear. '
A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA DNA.
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost inviolable the same - the cod of the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and hair cuts sent to Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the paragraphs from Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst a 35-year-old prison sentence, after having classified as secret secret secret secret diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has been transformed into technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissidentin, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-hagborg has been extracted by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted from Manning, and made out of the 30 portraits, how someone could look like this genomic data, a sharp, albeit intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly talking about identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
By the jail, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a baskettle, black and white selfie, in which manning clearly appears on a driver's seat and a burglary - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.
It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette stummel and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not attend this time and she could not be photographed, so you contact Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse were exchanged into unequal letters over two years.
They even created a of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Suppressed Images" that predicted a future in which the President of Chelsea's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.
Indeed, Obama ’ s release only a few days after the book was published, Mannings ’ release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also now at the opening of the exhibition, a little low and Starkes, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender-troops to find new, tweet-capable ways to resolve the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.
When Dewey-hagborg was asked about all these things, she said, "things happen for a specific reason".
In a painting on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for Manning with its oversized signature (the "i" in their family name is marked with a heart) an end of the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture.
On the opposite wall, their mitochondriale DNA sequence - a thousand inserter of Cs and Gs and as, in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take away is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, also can be.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in its own space is a page from the above comic novella.
She shows Manning how she appeared with a free phone call from the disciplinary arsenal of the United States such as King-Kong.
"When they cold your speech, they won ', it says.
"So never stop the mouth".
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me", said the artist who greet from Philadelphia.
"I still get ferries when I talk about it '.
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition - just as foresight in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacres, which are like hordes of protest.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplogrous were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel that they like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement that was formed behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford for killing was sought.,...,.......
A nationwide human jagd is under way for a professor at Northwestern University, and an employee at Oxford University, who are considered suspects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.

Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the site of what happened dead, and detective investigating detective investigating the killings, while the police actively sought for the two suspects.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.
Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice President for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been certified and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help US investigators in every possible way."

Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building age of the Grand-Plaza building, which had just received a puzzling tip that had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.

"We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko.
Russian Deputy remier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for restoring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect ", said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for reintroducing RUSADA and recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he has nothing to worry about Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future, he added.
One of the criteria listed in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have reported the results of the WADA approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: 'We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programmes, and we will not admit something that does not exist. '
Mutkos ’ s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added: 'We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one has to accept this report unconditionally ', added Smirnov.
RUSADA was ruled out in November 2015 in the wake of the Doping scandals from the WADA from the implementation of doping controls in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the Organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli, RUSADA was moved in the right direction to be re-used.
Aldi sells no eggs anymore.
The company groups shared.
It was a mere precaution that no health impact could continue to be taken from any health impact, it was stated in the communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which demonstrably negative on fipronile-resistant anti-Läusemittel.
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to measure your luck at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity", said Errett who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
It has called people from outside for help.
A new Human Resources Start-ups is on guard to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, specific groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowern allow C suite executives to circumvent the executive board and turn directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment.
Errett said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can follow why.
Companies are coming to see that at the top of job culture so that you do not become the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment that punishes those who have spoken.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation, and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, following the financial site Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the middle of the Uber case.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent companies can send tailor-made "surveys, gather confidential answers in real time and to view the heat types of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows people to report bad behavior.
And if the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that its employees are badly treated or unethical, it can cost costly consequences by consumer boycott, worker mobility and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the Restaurant-Kette with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, Convercent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and procedures, and have a simple way to achieve their headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints from employees.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hided by executives that have been hidden in offices in cities or states, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into experience with employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment - litigation."
Companies began to take more seriously ethics, values and employee commitment in 2002 after the accounting -Firma Arthur Andersen for ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took until the "social media rightly came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden burden the companies with recurring charges for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February by companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thereby raising the entire capital to $47 million.
Glitcers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, and brought his total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only sales.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belongs, and that the work you are doing is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which both Convercent and Glint.
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well, and businesses are good if employees are involved.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
Data on employee commitment to the experts of job culture.
But the data are useless when the managers of a company do not take action.
Indeed, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come fast enough, or at all, it can be disappointments and employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International, which has seen too much on collecting data.
"For if you don't follow employees ask me," Have you heard me really?
Are you looking for it?
And who do not care about why should I? '
Madison Reed, who is now running monthly surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, so Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people ', said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for Bruins.
At 23 p.m., when a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus.
Some have withdrawn their tricot upper parts and show the back full sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, they are a lunch break.
Players who are committed to the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise exercise to their final exams before they return the next morning at 6: 30 pm to the Football Center.
"This is for the guys the next three days a real tretmill", said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday was Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
That is why the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 p.m. to meet the already completed schedule.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the break starts at the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood.
In the course of August 18 exercises, 20 before the formal preparation of game preparation for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the regulatory change of the NCAA, even if they add another point.
"We place this enormous burden three or four days on them, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they simply pushed through, they are great people.
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great. '
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is closed, given the clear visibility lines of its fields from a adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been used with foot balls, which will be a protective net behind a torpfosten.
Bruins-Spieler will occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people are there to rent a room and then set up there to be an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking.
We will do the best to do with what we have.
I am not concerned about this.
We have a plan. '
Facebook wants to intensify the campaign against counterfeit messages.
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news at fake reviews from third parties and their results under the original contribution, then the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday, it is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake-news.
The company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify potential falsification and to send them to fact-checking results from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main points for so-called fake-news, many of whom believe they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters in the run-up to the presidential elections in May with false stories, and Germany supported a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before the elections in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that the US, France, the Netherlands, and Germany, will launch a test of the new fact-review.
"In addition to the realization of the stories of facebook verifiers of third parties, the people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook-News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the "article" and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England.
In his recent past, the small Scotney Castle in a Squeeze music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," says he wewehly.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England ', revived the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney,, and.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly emotionally.
"I only responded to the pressure on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 years, which was written for the Jakobiner worked", he says.
"That is his fingerprint!
And letters always smell after smoke, because at that time, you breed fire because of light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were himself.
Ach, I love Archive! "
For someone who has been beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle ("To be honest: I have my welcome welcome greeting a little overvalued") it seems all too beautiful to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the viktorian "new" castle, watch the archives and discover the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the monstrous Hyänenköpfe on the walls and the bottles that spent centuries in the grave.
He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapes, ferries and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he trank "Whiskey and began to write".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only received full access in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes entered a decade later, employees began to look after the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which Aristocrats said" Oh, they were on the roof.
Tagebücher, letters from the time of English empires, cards that represent what possessed: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a Birke to fight the two families.
Young, let everything go! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to appear on a broader basis in English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly-built castle to join the farmer's rebuilt castle in 1381.
"There is a record of an uproar that appeared in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"The farm uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start.
Perhaps the two are interconnected? '
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit pater tells the Darrell family for seven years during English reform.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, which was his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his sarg was).
The Darrells are Rhodes ’ favorite family of Scotney: "The masters seemed to be pretty Gauner to keep debt and spend money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys, with a talent to advertise herbs. "" "" "". "" "" "" "" "". "" "" "" "" "" "" ""
After the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experience.
He has made a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatoriums dating back to the early 20th century.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like: "Ach, now I have to cope with the damned life."
Campaign started: over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf.
With the contraception of 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau from Thursday).
Until Thursday mayor of Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Artz the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Or? ", ask the Macher of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We think that (of course!) do not really", write them on their website yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that, as a bath of Honnefer citizens, we know the beauty and attractiveness of our city. '
The action is more than "only" a logo and a slogan, meaning it goes on.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable omnipresent".
After all, they compete with other communities.
The city of Bad Honnef has its new umbrella brand and cost the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
In early August, Ankara is advising the Supreme Military Council (YAS) on retirement and promotions in the Official Corps.
This week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting took place no longer in the building of the general stable, as it was in the prime minister's seat.
The discussions under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government now also took part in the five Vice-remiers and the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Home Affairs Ministers.
In that way, civilians were in the YAS.
The government attracts the military.
Hulusi Akar is still in office, but the commanders of the army, the army's commanders, the air forces and.
Since the failed coup, Prime Minister Erdogan has fired 169 of 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the exile Prediger Fethullah Gülen, the Erdogan as a drahter of the coup attempt.
Against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, has been negotiated in Ankara this week..
On the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the “Gottesenk ”, because he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces".
But does Erdogan really manage the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unbehagen in the military headquarters".
In general, there are concerns about increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself in the lifting of the headscarf for Soldaters, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the army and the security forces goes further.
In mid-July, Erdogan made a further 7395 public servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan had counted the military.
The generals were formerly the real masters of the country.
Three times they were questioned on their role as guardian of the secular state order.
Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military step by step, not least by calling on the European Union ’ s reforms.
Former officers say that Erdogan is a targeted Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a namesake of not named officers who sought asylum after the coup attempt to seek asylum abroad, the Turkish army would be 'full of extremists and salafists'.
If that happens, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, the Alliance has doubts about the willingness to use the Turkish army.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "weakened, say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules, President Donald Trump, cited by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to track track track for racing enthusiasts.
Over the past few months, the future of the racing huttles was yesterday - now it is going to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, the maroden route on which the tourist train will be built.
In order to secure the future of the racing huttles, the Ministry of Transport will start construction work on the track.
"With the decision to continue to order the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this mainly for tourism," declared Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country takes 75%.
The Treaty, based on which the shuttle is intended to be ordered by the country in the future, is now being voted definitively.
The Ministry and South Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"This is the roadmap, the vehicles used and quality standards," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.
The race track shuttle will be scheduled for December 2017.
The racetrack shuttle is a popular destination for tourists.
Over the past few months, a pilot operation has been tested as to whether the route is used by enough many people to re-order them in the future.
The route is also due in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried about the rise of sex robots.
Just as you thought that in 2017 cannot be even more crazy, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex-robots are now a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritized professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University, and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest and the type of fingernagel.
"People are funny about them, but the companies supply a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey said when publishing his new report.
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions "and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more worrying because many robots have "personalities" that would make a stepford-woman look progressively.
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix-Roboter allows, for example, to adapt their robots to the characteristics they look like, for example.
And then there is also the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of pupils and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible", the site of True Companion.
So it may be what you like, and it doesn't like what you like, etc.
Over the course of the day, she also has their votes - like real people!
It may be tired to be fixed on conversation or it can be "in mood"! "
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the subservient female characteristics, the contagion on rape if one step on Frigid (i.e. here: resisting) Farrah, is a most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men have no roxxy?" is it on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toys.
Their origins and their growing refinement indicate somewhat darker and depths in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.
Most men will, of course, have no sex robots, and while the FRR increases their popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture.
But what emerges from the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time we live in.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives permission.
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots are appearing in a time when women ’ s rights are under threat in the White House, where there is a president who has blamed women to have sexually attacked..
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphic images, the winding bodies and the fleshed eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn proportions).
Their builders want to feel humane that they feel the movement of a real body.
But, when it comes to their 'personalities', the robots are not real women.
They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjugation.
In other words, they are slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speech: service powers dchen
Trump ’ s great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.
It has become a truism of the Trump era that polarized political divisions that have polarized the US electorate, including families in small format.
Around Christmas and Erntedankfest, there were newspapers in the United States about how to deal with the horror of Trump.
We are all supposed to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less notice has been noticed by Trump ’ s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousine, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect on a common enemy..,......,.....
With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows, including the Republican kinship that she had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
To the table, that is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that this entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the staggering effect of his presidency has the power to push us all.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gruelling possibility that his powers will no longer be deducted.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right-wing wing wing, which suddenly appear to appear as an epitome of sensibility compared to its.,,..,..,..,...
Today, I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s funny version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement) - both compared to Trump, in fact, a very mild offence.
When Trump goes, the Republican nominee must be mental health only to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.
When my cousine in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousel of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a coff.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarce and the animals are twisted to look at their own shoulders - extremely finster and the climate-friendly music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city: the views of high buildings are old, which skylines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not meet the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not entirely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - but a large circular traffic in the north of London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, since two two-year old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old and two women in the..,,,,.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to compensate for a 15% tip - to buy something about the charge.
This does not only lead to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no necessary.
The poor woman in the department of department at the department of department, while I got tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with breast pain from prison to hospital.
Pistorius has left the prison for the second time.
Last year, he was brought to the hospital for treatment of cuts in his hands, according to a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first attack.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of the Valentinstags 2013 by several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he had his girlfriend for a night intrusion that hides in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius appeal, which they say they are too indulgent.
The National prosecution authority said that they will raise objections at the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the claim could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his penalty to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg.
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the Viertklässler were released from feet and Epfenhofen to holiday and to the secondary schools.
Three of the Members of Parliament are going to go to the Gymnasium, four at the real school.
Schulleiterin Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public in the Biesental in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol for school dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, a young eagle who grew up in chickens, but then released into freedom.
The muntere Schar was a musical entitled "The eagle in the chicken in the chickenerhof.
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and left it from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken cloud, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken, the eagle spread on a high mountain his wings and decisively.
Then the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken.
Hennen danced with the young gockles, the cylinders used to make the bet.
The adler stands for integration, said Schulleiterin Angelika Sitte.
The boy is different from the other young animals (chicks), but they belong to them.
He will never be like a chicken.
His provision is to be free.
They wanted every four cupboards that he feels accepted in his new school.
It followed the words of gratitude to the colleagues of former school leader Michael Müller, who has repeatedly jumped in lessons and the parents.
Sophia Schumacher was over, explained classmate teacher Sophia Schumacher.
They leave their students after two years of teaching only very unjust because it was a really great time.
Finally, they can rely on the Fourth Crusade.
To conclude, all pupils have a song from summer time and holiday time.
In doing so, children had great pleasure.
For the new school year, eight first klässler is registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited by television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal people arrested in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released, while an investigation is currently running.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camps and put anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose to stay substantial fines.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine fine.
Software Update for diesel vehicles: What those affected now need to know?
How exactly is the software update?
Should diesel drivers be involved in the action?
The most important questions and answers.
At the same time, BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They should improve the emission behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates only apply to the vehicles that have firewall software", says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has ordered the power station (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months, but there is still no precise date.
Daimler has informed everyone concerned.
If an inspection is due, this will be done within its framework.
How long will the conversion of equipment altogether?
"Sword to say", says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and political pressure.
"For we have seen the voluntary action by car manufacturers on the environment."
How long should the update?
Conversion itself could take only three to four hours.
It may be more expensive to get an appointment.
What do car drivers who do not drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE is waiting for you.
It is likely that foreign manufacturers would follow Smetanin.
Is there a massive fall in euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
But in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas there is no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE is proposing to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award award.
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper one of the prestigious Kennedy Center.

We make the city worth living.
Roland Wacker, Haslach ’ s city builders, is going to retire in the.,,..........
The job is already advertised - but suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been the city builder.
And the work still gives him great fun, as he conveys in the press interview.
He reports of varied but challenging tasks that await his successors.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application will meet the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or building engineer.
In this way - with regard to regular termination periods - is still enough time for a review.
As Haslach is responsible for the administrative community as a subordinate authority, the applicant must provide appropriate qualifications.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they were no longer able to fill them, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg.
But proximity is the city and it itself important to him, Wacker says Wacker, who reports from a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years, some significant projects have accumulated on Wacker with pride.
"We make the city worth", he is assured of the construction office and its employees.
In the future, however, varied projects are on the agenda: redesigned by the former Hukla Arena and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, are also.
The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, also the stadium renovation is still subject.
The latter alone will beat around EUR 1.5 million to beech, 'if we do' s right ', estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. "
There is a great room for manoeuvre for a city builder.
With Haslachs ’ own construction house and gardening can respond to a lot of flexibility.
"You can move a lot", so wacker, and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
As the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to have "an eye for what is fit" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builders.
In any case, the town mayor is responsible.
He is a builder, "at the end of everything here on my table".
He can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been working for the past ten years, Manfred Schöner ()..,.
Also, that his successor would like Wacker: "We are looking for someone who wants to be really identified with the place and stay".
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit the city of Haslach, you should have a completed study as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor with technical direction architecture and the right of expertise in the fields of construction and planning law.
The City Construction Office includes high and deep-building, construction planning, basic work, administration of urban properties, municipal buildings, municipal office with Bauhof and Stadtgärtnerei, as well as underground building rights authority including monument protection.
Bicycle on guided guided tours: South Railways closed.
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had the blue bike from the railway line in the area of Leobener Strasse (B116).
These were severely damaged so that the incoming freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for the night hours.
Near the Tatort were witnesses a rosaroter roller and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich", said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch to APA.
The perpetrators or the perpetrators would have brought themselves into great danger and also jeopardising access.
In addition to the damage to the locality and the equipment and the delay and the cost of rail transport could also be pampered to the perpetrators.
Overall, the spokesman said that the spokesman.
The damage had been rectified on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the South track could be carried out without disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains were excluded from Friday morning, two of them affected.
Goods did not fall, but they had delayed.
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch, around 200 meters had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory disease).
Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.
But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases.
The insoluble state, which affects around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom, 300,000, causes stomach and leaves, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal intestinal.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immunositional cells in Darm are patrouillieren to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissue.
If the balance goes too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory disorder..
In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance for immunization at mice that carries a certain bacterium in their enclosure.
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the microbioms, and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance.
The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells ".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a druyptophan rich diet, promotes less inflammatory intestinal intestinal, if the same system also affects people.
The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immunization cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not had.
She believed that the difference with the intestinal robiomen of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungal fungi that normally live in the stomach.
The dams of mice were DNA sequentially and six bacteria species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing from the mice.
mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they did not develop this kind of immunization, and they did not develop this type of immunization cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grew into a fluid and then passed small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - on unmature immune cells that were isolated by mice.
Immune cells developed to tolerate tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned from liquid, it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan-metabolism, known as the Indol-3 milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50%, but when the trutophane values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri, the cells develop in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to Tryptophan.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells inflammation on the inner surface of the Darms.
Potentiell can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "Genie".
At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic, signed a "Genie", Jose Mourinho, after the middle feldplayer played his debut at Sampdoria.
The £40 million signature of Chelsea began with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was excluded from the Preparatory Asia Tournee of Blues and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football", said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku in the Aviva-Stadion, as Mourinho started his start XI for the beginning of.,,.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments, but he insisted that the club has already done a 'fantastic job', three of his four priority commitments.
"Three of four, for which I thank the association", he added.
"I will be happier if they get four out of four, but they have taken a great deal."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky.
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle to the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US, which are several thousand kilometres.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens, the form of a Dreamliner.
The whole was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing-Logo was painted in the sky.
New Tiefstrike for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem with a problem.
As the wind revolves around: when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader, socialist prime minister looked at elections with a certain concern for Berlin.
Bloß no disturbances from the party central, just no headwind from the covenant - the most important desire of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz has led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt House are watching the events in the SPD governed state capitals.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of this year would not be described in the approach.
They were depressed.
That is one after another.
According to the surprising end of the rot-green majority in Lower Saxony, a general signal against coalition of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red Green cannot be ruled out reliable," said CDU-Secretary-General Peter Tauber said the editorial network Germany (RND).
Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has plunged into a severe crisis.
Five months before the election of the country lost its rot-green coalition thus lost its voting majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Michael Kellner, the founder of the German Federal Chancellor, has called on the downfall of Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
The transition to CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return their mandate, "said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens (RND).
"This must not be true ', a SPD campaigner, when the SPD campaign, when the new Hiobsbotschaft reaches the party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is after crossing the Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD countries.
And no one knows what comes next.
The plight began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, more no, calmed the genes at the time.
After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westphalia will be different.
It was then - and everything was much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the.
In the weeks after that, the genes were reared.
Then when they had just had new courage, the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And he came the next deep strike.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie sat while his city.
And because in crisis communication, he made quite wrong about everything that can be wrong.
Since then, Scholz has struggled to survive.
Now Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust and his role in the supervisory board of the Lower Saxon Prime Minister has been criticized for a long time.
Miese surveyed added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because, in recent weeks, it has tried to put the emphasis on the covenant.
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin, the Genossen environment of Martin Schulz.
They gave him because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the opposite could happen.
This is because the partisan divisions of the Lower Saxony Greens are not in fact responsible.
And Schulz not at all.
Sometimes the genes are trying to keep their own ranks.
Her anger is directed towards the Greens, and above all, to the disillusionment of parliamentarians Twesten.
"It is intolerable and democratic compensation, as Mrs Twesten has put their own careers about the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Bundestagsfraction, the editorial network Deutschland (RND).
Mrs Twesten is not because of her person as a director, but about the country list of Lower Saxony Greens into Parliament.
The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestagsfraction, complains a "undemocratic maneuver".
"The electorate wanted four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil as Prime Minister," says Oppermann who leads the Dutch SPD as a top candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now, the personal careers of a future CDU MEP," said Oppermann continues.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know whether there has been more or less commitments made by the CDU Niedersachsen.
Funding for local core III
Anyone who wants to renovate his house in the years will soon be able to receive support from the country.
The mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a look at what has happened.
Since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas.
At that time, in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
After all, Schindler ’ s remedies are a "success project" - it is important to promote internal development, not only new areas.
On 4 April, the government Presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The amount amounted to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 from the country, the rest of the community received.
How is a rehabilitation area?
One will continue to investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in the planned area of any interest to be remedied..,....,......
If necessary, the territorial borders could then be postponed again.
The STEC agreed on Wednesday Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the bundle programme "Social City", where the remedies would be carried out.
The core of the programme is revitalizing urban areas, improving housing and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure.
The measures would be taken objectively, that is, per plot.
Finally, the recovery area would be laid down as a statute.
The eligibility period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, the stocktaking took stock of the questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire.
In November or December, the decision should be made as much as possible, so that we can start with the rehabilitation decision next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each local authorities must carry out the preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing the urban abuses and deciding when to be rehabilitated and to what extent.
It will also be registered in the basic book.
Pietzschmann will come back to receiving a picture of the situation, promised them.
Gotzel stressed, an essential factor in the project is the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be able to be filled up by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arc" where it is concerned, among other things, the building state and sanitation.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing boxes", data on size, distribution and residents of a living space.
The blue "operating bogen" is only to be filled if the premises are operated in the premises.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.
Moreover, new measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funding according to the 'greyhound principle', who first comes, first.
You cannot reserve the right to reserve the right.
In conclusion, photos of the project "Local kern II" were shown to make the attendant a clean-up ".
British inventor is using a microchip to get into house and car.
A British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even with a mobile movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip between Daumen and Zeigefinger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultative anaesthesists at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cats and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an additional £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost thousands of taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month, costs taxpayers according to the military data handed over to the TIME magazine, up to $24,000.
The green white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence, and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a fire-fighting car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House ’ s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South Lawn, following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility", the commander of the HMX-1 commander on the eve of the event, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter was on 17 July at 7 a.m. on the South Lawn for the event at 15 p.m., and so long remained until the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 p.m. this evening was cleared..,,,,, and.,,,.,,,,,,.,,.,,.,,,
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to restrictions on hours of service, a second crew for the return flight.
The original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel was on the ground during the flight.
The records made available by TIME were not clear whether a second flight was required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state-owned property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate the event.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case ', wrote the commander.
"Klingt as if you are closed", the deputy commander.
The "Made in America" was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave a boost to the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he advocated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is not a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But their use only for a photo OP is unusual.
In February, Trump conducted an investigation when the presidential aircraft was launched against the background of his first campaign campaign campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, Taxidienste, and his Twitter account is full of news that complained about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled by the show" Made In America "- the products made from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX 1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn in order to avert US President in the White House.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 led the White House 58 exercise exercises.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was counted on the training needs of flight crew for the month, said a official.
Helicopter units added 11 hours this day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayer did not take the burden for any of the other requirements presented at the event.
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not hold budget awards for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to the US Department of Defense for the financial year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour.
Recordings of the unit recorded the airplane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.
'The cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading, "said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD does not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract completion.
At this time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week that are manufactured in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this. '
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he interacted with the South Lawn for the event, but he set himself in the driver ’ s seat of a fire brigade.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the President, "I have three of them."

How America of OMV
Donald Trump did not really feel happy when he put his signature under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his hate to enact the law," the Congress adopted a few "unconstitutional rules", he estimated.
The response from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US.
After all, the draft plans to punish European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors from the local OMV, who are jointly co-financed with other European firms to build the Russian Baltic Sea region Nord Stream 2.

Nevertheless, it is too early to assess the consequences, such as the official statement of the oil company.
Indeed, Donald Trump would have to raise the sanctions by Executive Order.

Role backwards: The city produces 46 kitchen aids a small kitchen.
The city organizes the Kita-lunch sticks.
With fixed contact partners for children and an allocation to the team.
The clock is reversed in urban children ’ s days.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over the city of Krefeld.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy leader in the field of youth aid, this is good news: "We have all very pleased".
Gekocht is still out of house: A caterer takes this task and supplies freshly cooked cooled.
The town operates 46 children ’ s day-trips in Krefeld, in 44 children receive a warm meal.
Last Kitajahr sat 2800 children at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"Today not only children who are cared for 45 hours in the Kita at lunch", explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour service if children stay up to 14 o'clock.
46 part-time workers from 1 September: They are warming up the food supplied, supplement them to salad, raw food and fruit, portionate the meal individually, give the meal, remove, wash and purify the kitchen.
"The employees are fixed in a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven group units - decides on the hourly range.
"The kitchen workers are now firmly part of the Kita Team", says Pommeranz.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts".
This is also about: healthy diet and cooking lessons.
"Children are supposed to help prepare food.
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is good.
For children too.
"You have a well-known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for children.
The cleansing of the Kita rooms - so far as the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also highlighted the charm that it has proved to be the most cost-comparative between own governments and foreign lending for the city as the most economical one.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are re-recruited.
"But these hours are not so strong in the educational area," says Sonja Pommeranz.

GMB concerns about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow.
A trade union wants to become a member of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company had outweighed the future of investment at the Tollcross-site site.
More than 500 employees work in the plant, which produces hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVities ’ s owner said that he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be the first to learn if their activities change.
In a letter to the branch of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie's asked to express concerns that funding for modernising production lines is not being promoted '.
GMB-senior-organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross, concerns our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force are concentrated on the local community and the Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
That is why, with the prospect of jobs, wage and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow, urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie.
A spokesman of Pladis said: "The Filialleiter at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland, and the company will respond directly to it, as we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the staff that we, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate, are constantly reviewing our transactions - and this applies to all our business areas and sites - to..
It added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross-site site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site.
Did the PSG Barcelona three years ago before Neymar?
The page of La Liga may have their interest in Marco Verratti bereuen euen.
Paris Saint-Germain will not fail in its prosecution of Neymar after having issued an offer of £189 million in order to resolve his exemption clause, but did they have Barcelona three years before the World Record?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba in the last season for £89 million in Manchester United.
After the end, Neymar will become the most expensive players in the world and the highest paid professional players in the world.
Barcelona is angry about the way in which Neymar has forced its way out, even though a source close to the Catalan Executive Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the football world three years ago by the PSG president warned about this prospect?
When Manchester City was interested in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.

Interview: "Domspatzen-report relieves Papst-Brother Georg Ratzinger".
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of waste, Papst-brother Georg Ratzinger.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen is further concerned.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the Reformist Movement "We are Church", explained to the German press agency, he expects from the former Regensburger Bischof and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritized Pope Benedict XVI..
It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret at their own omissions or their misjudgments at the time.
The Vatican law "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the fact that when reporting on violence in the domain of domain treasures.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it should be "shameful and shameful deeds" handle, which would have to be punished and in the future; but the 'degree of medial manipulation', the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.
Also Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerische Rundfunk: "You are happy to go to the church and this is a dedicated frescoes".
She also pointed out that, in her youth, "Worse", was a very normal pedagogical means "to deal with frech children, as I was one.
It would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuse of cases, Papst-brother Georg Ratzinger.
To be wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial band "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I must take Georg Ratzinger to protect", says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him", he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report, which presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 domspheres sexually ab.
In the final report it states to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "To sum up, so that Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence were applied.
Especially in high emotionality, punishment for pupils could also be more intense.
Nevertheless, contrary to many other accused accused people of the general humanity of R., and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories with him '.
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the 'incidents of violence on protection befohlenen in the Regensburger Domspatzen' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears to be a choleric and perfectionist, which became the trumpet when a dome has not brought top performance.
How do you consider your biograph this final report??
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why Georg Ratzinger is actually happening.
He has just been dedicated to eight pages, and he is clearly expressed by any suspicion of complicity or co-wiser in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence took place in the prevalence of the pre-school.
It is not possible to accuse him of having learned too late or first hints.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he acted, was practically all respondents as - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
For example, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger, a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm hearty", "popular", "sincere", "and" understandable ", as a very good teacher, who regularly accompanied the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbonbons and" always dreamed of children ".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has also led to anger anger.
The fact that he was not only with stools and the key bund on the ground, but also earrings distributed and all too freche boys to the hair or ears, he himself has already admitted many years ago.
But it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s, were widespread, with parents like teachers.
Do you also know such surveys?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I have also seen this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and violence on the prevalence of the prevalence, are that of Bagatells.
As one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his reputation and role as the brother of Benedict XVI.
After all, many who have never understood him, still eagerly.
The truth, however, is that the report relies Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, there has been a great deal about the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger be placed in the final report any involvement or participation in sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: No.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were borrowed.
"I never dared to speak with my father or my mother," said a spokesperson for the others, "I was all very embarrassing".
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.
If they did not even familiarise parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator.
How do the Domspatzen-pupils rate rate rate rate role in relation to abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A questioned student put it so: "Regarding sexual abuse... I do not see a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrators.
I also think it is really absurd to assume that it has opened up... Buben intrusive or clear or even more open than to their parents, internships, trust teachers, confidence teachers etc.
That you talk about sex... - unthinkable. "
The report concludes the very clear result: 'The fact that he was involved in the run-up to the student and / or their environment, was unable to be confirmed within the framework of the investigation.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any co-worker.
Nor can he be accused of not preventing him or being notified.
There is therefore no reason to link its good name with these illegal crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, much of "violence" in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger report is accused of "Wegblick".
Do he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that the reporting has been mixed and fuelled into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.
But that is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
After all, there is a clean separation: between the prevalence and the gymnasium of the domain, between sexual abuse and violence, and we say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir conductor of the domain.
The horror pedagogy, the cases in which Knaben of sadistic teachings have been harassed and maltreated, and they were suffering from the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most of the witnesses, the theme of "preschool" tabu.
It was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: As there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that 'many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories with him'.
At most, the accusation of having looked away.
Yet, despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the state on the pre-school conditions.
The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again in 1993.
Does Georg Ratzinger have consistently heard the ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which even reproduced the report.
He points out that "in the pre-school is continuing to practise caning".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as everyone knows.
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the actual limit was exceeded.
However, we cannot say that he would have always looked away.
That is simply not true.
In 1980, the caning of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.,,..,....,....
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "trap of anachronism", that is to say the danger of passing past moral standards.
The prince is right.
However, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was horrified at all times, and not for what was hidden in the pre-school of antagonism and violence on innocent children, which goes far beyond what was then practice.
That is all terrifying and I am glad that it is finally being worked.
But, at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His resources to discipline and punishment, that is to say earnest and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he was also strictly adhered to.
What picture of his Regensburger Zeit has Georg Ratzinger for the book "My brother of the Pope"?
Can the subject of caning in this regard?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is to say Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, because the domain spheres played only one side.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he had a strict regime there.
But it must also be said: without this perfectionism, without calling for absolute discipline, it would not have been possible for him to form a body of world class, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which twice twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With Keksen and Bonbons alone, you can make no big singers and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What a person did you see for Georg Ratzinger in the talks about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger really well and always again as a wonderful, humorous, humorous and heartfelt people who could not imagine that he could only do something.
I regularly get in touch with how many former dome treasures still today, 23 years after his Emeritization, keep in contact with him, read him - he is almost blind - and how a member of her family.
Those who have not forgiven him until now that he was strict with them are clearly in the minority..
Most domes are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he is always a good, energetic teacher - a strict father, but that may be - but also a loving respect for whom they are still standing up today and whom they deny.
And I would like to make it quite clear that everything you accuse to them are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time..,..,.......
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, only because it is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.
It is all too obvious that this is all too obvious.
The report that has just been published is relieved.
Now the decency, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without Bayerns, and perhaps Germany, no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen to finally get into peace.
