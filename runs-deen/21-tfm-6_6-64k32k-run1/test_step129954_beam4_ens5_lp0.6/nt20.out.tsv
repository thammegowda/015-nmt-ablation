Mysteries solved : That ’ s why we cannot tickle ourselves .	-4.2432
A kind of brake in the brain prevents people from ticking themselves , as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments on rats , as they announced on Thursday evening , even though progress has been made on the question of why children fight themselves so fiercely against the tickling , only to demand more .	-8.4197
After all , it has also become clear why only getting closer to a tickling hand causes laughter before touching it .	-7.4291

Iran Frees British Tankers	-1.4468
The United Nations General Debate did not resolve the Iran conflict , but now there is one problem less : the British oil tanker , which has been detained in Iran , ' Stena Impero ' , has been able to strike sea again ; it could be a piece of a puzzle in Iranian President Ruhani 's peace plan .	-11.8976
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " , which has been detained in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July , is back in international waters .	-5.2369

The British Government , behind the stipulation of the ' Stena Impero ' , suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar : at the beginning of July , a supertanker with oil from Iran , which was supposed to have been destined for Syria , was put in the chain , with the authorities violating EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria , and the British receiving the reference to the ship from the United States .	-9.7400

Since then , the US government has been putting pressure on Iran ’ s leaders to impose tougher economic sanctions on the country , and Iran has resisted pressure .	-10.0937

India is obstructing a better future with its protectionist economic policies .	-2.5941
With America ’ s President Donald Trump imposing punitive tariffs on Chinese producers , foreign producers in the People ’ s Republic are being forced to redeploy , with Asian heads of finance considering moving their production from China to another country , India , in a UBS survey , cite it as one of the preferred alternatives , not just to do with the imponderables of the Sino-American trade war . With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers , India seems to be set to play a more important role in the global production chain .	-9.7030
But now India itself has got into Trump ’ s focus , dubbed the “ Kingdom of Tariffs ” by the White House , America in early June stripped the emerging country of trade preferences for 2000 products . The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods , mobile phones , spirits , motorcycles , and more .	-8.1255
On the world map of trade wars , however , friction with India is only a sideshow , and America sees the world ’ s largest democracy through security spectacles as well . Delhi and Washington combine concerns about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean , and thus an unlikely Salve American punitive tariffs against India , so India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who has just taken office for a second five-year term , is likely to weigh in safety .	-8.2606
The problem , however , lies elsewhere : the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development in the Socialist Republic of India has a difficult state ; Modi ’ s zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic insanity that has suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long ; firms are now receiving faster building permits for buildings ; they benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure ; and a more manageable bankruptcy and bankruptcy law creates the conditions to liquidate high-debt , sham firms .	-10.4901
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings , and many things have changed for the better in India in the first five Modi years , but this is not true in trade policy , driven by protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers , even creating new barriers by the National-conservative government .	-7.7597
In the West , Modi ’ s nimbus of the energetic reformer , who is economically radically renewing his country , is dependent on the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like . But , at the core of the India First Advokat , he never depends on protectionist economic policies , which prevent Indian firms from being forced to abandon anachronistic procedures and thus become fit for global competition . Businessmen who survive thanks to the closure of their industries are among Modi ’ s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ’ s regular electors , and are applauding this short-sighted policy .	-9.2696

Aimed at competitors : Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships .	-4.4896
In the first run of the men over 5000 metres , Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to waver dangerously , but he could hardly hold himself on his feet just 300 metres before the finish , ran into an unhealthy and ill-tempered position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly stopped him , supporting him in the last half of the stadium round .	-29.3973
" I just wanted to help him , everyone in this situation would have done the same , " said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone , when he unexpectedly drew the attention of the assembled journalists , and he didn 't want to talk at all about his heroism , because he wanted to set up his personal record and when he realized that this would be difficult , he only wanted to help a sufferer , and in any case he would be proud to represent his country , which was invited to the World Cup , and under normal he , .	-16.8312
In the end , it had nothing to do with the fact that Busby , who had only come to his destination with a great deal of help , was disqualified by the World Athletics Federation .	-28.4238
While Dabo , who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon , came to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha , which , according to official data , was 18 : 10.87 minutes , but he himself was disappointed : " I wanted to run for 17 : 55 minutes , I was already under 18 minutes , " but only in training , the best times do not count .	-10.5184

The work was first exhibited in the Bristol Museum in the southwest of Britain , where Banksy lives , in 2009 , when the artist re-exhibited the painting , coinciding with the original Brexit date on March 29 , when the work , formerly called " Question Time , " was renamed " Devolved Parliament " .	-6.1167

Most recently , at the House ’ s first meeting on Wednesday , following the Supreme Court ’ s removal of a forced break imposed by Johnson , Prime Minister Boris Johnson engaged in a harsh exchange of views with the opposition . Johnson wants to do the already twice postponed Brexit on October 31 , if necessary , without any agreement with the EU .	-9.3993
It is not the first time that Banksy , whose identity is still unknown , has interfered in the Brexit debate : at Dover in the south-east of England , he painted a picture of a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a knife , and thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors to the United Kingdom every day .	-6.4124

Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Khan Calls for Uno Intervention in Kashmir	-1.7198
With an emotional appeal , Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again urged the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly .	-8.8221

Not Even a Bottle of Water	-1.1223
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi .	-2.4526
In response to Egypt ’ s current protests , the government is reacting with a hard hand , firing on the population with live ammunition , more than 2,000 arrested cronies in prisons with the 60,000 political prisoners already in detention .	-8.0468
But one of the causes of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation , with poverty , hopelessness , and the feeling of being stifled by one ’ s own government bringing millions to the streets , and that is a problem that el-Sisi ’ s regime , no matter how hard it is against adversaries , has also failed to get under control .	-7.9376
Today , one in three people in Egypt is living below the poverty line ; since 2016 , the currency has lost more than half its value , the rate of inflation stands at 10 % , and anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who to pay for it : Nestlé , Coca-Cola , or the military , which is responsible not only for repression , but also for the largest economic actor ; the military builds roads , houses , football stadiums , produces food , and much more , as it did before el-Sisi , with authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience , even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one ; it will always afford a bottle of water when large sections of the population have difficulty .	-9.8761

Hundreds of electrical cables are still to be remedied ; the Tüv wants to examine them by February .	-6.9403
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is a matter of lack of proof , not so much of new cables , and that there is still no release for all the nozzles on which the cable lines are attached , which the head of the airport expects to see before the end of the year .	-8.3457
In addition , fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily , the problems that led the project to another crisis three years ago : this time there are smoke aprons that will be shut down like a screen on a fire so that the smoke does not spread , and 36 engines have to be replaced , so that at the beginning of the year there will be new experiments with hot gas smoke .	-11.8945
The airport was originally scheduled to open in 2011 , and costs increased from € 2 billion to € 6.5 billion ( $ 6.6 billion ) since construction began in 2006 .	-8.2442
Since passenger numbers in Berlin have risen significantly since then , those responsible are planning to expand the airport , which is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October is due to take place , as Chairman Bretschneider announced .	-6.1157

In Nigeria , police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school , and , according to evidence from local residents , the security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the minor victims , as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said .	-7.8732
In fact , the protectors were held by their teachers under " most degrading and inhumane conditions , " said Sabo .	-6.5933
According to reports , the Koran school has been in existence for about ten years , and local residents would have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the establishment , and the parents would have been shocked to learn about the conditions in the Koran school , said Sabo , who had not been aware of the suffering of their children ; the operator and six staff were arrested by the police .	-9.6534
In Nigeria ’ s predominantly Muslim north , there are many private Koran schools that replace often deficient state institutions , with people in the region suffering frequent attacks by armed gangs , and so , according to the UN Refugee Agency , more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to neighboring Niger in the past decade .	-6.5188

Nicaragua 's captain declared that he had never voted in the World Soccer Election , and other countries made accusations against the Fifa .	-7.3690
In the past few years , many of Fifa ’ s actions have been criticized : World Cup awards , dubious plans by its president Gianni Infantino , the general conduct of corrupt officials .	-15.6868
But , having already complained to Nicaragua ’ s captain that he had not voted at all , there are other inconsistencies that are emerging : Egypt is complaining that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account ; indeed , they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting list .	-7.3816
The Fifa apologises for the fact that " the signatures on the voting forms were in uppercase and therefore not valid " .	-7.4842
Sudan ’ s Trainer Surprise	-2.6011
There is also an outcry from Sudan about the election , and while the situation is understandable in the case of Egypt , the Sudanese Association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the way it was finally estimated : with Lionel Messi in place one , Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three .	-8.1830
Nicaragua ’ s captain , Juan Barrera , had also made accusations : “ did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards , and all the details of my vote are wrong , thank you , ” he wrote .	-7.6522
On Friday , the association reported that it was true but , of course , it was not intended : the voting documents were " mistakenly " marked with the name and signature of Juan Barrera , the captain of the Nicaraguan selection , as stated in a communication from the Association , but actually elected the second captain Manuel Rosas .	-13.8772

Ukraine ’ s Affair : Rangert Republicans favor official investigation . of the , , , , , , and .	-7.3822
" I think the investigation is important , " said the Republican governor of Vermont , Phil Scott . " Where this leads from here is determined by the facts to be found , " he wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken .	-5.7178
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine , according to Scott , " for years . "	-5.2516
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the Whistleblower affair , and few have been uneasy about it . Scott ’ s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party , with the moderate governor of Virginia having repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies , such as relaxing environmental legislation and tightening immigration regulations .	-7.1668
" It is a deeply disturbing situation , " said Baker . " The right course of action and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it .	-16.0494
Scott and Baker , as US state governor , have no formal say in the proceedings against Trump decided on in Congress , so their statements are particularly symbolic , but Republicans ’ first senators have also been critical of the situation . For example , Mitt Romney , who represents Utah ’ s state in the second chamber of parliament , has said that the case is “ extremely disturbing , deeply disturbing . ” US media have also reported that the Republicans are beginning to crack internally .	-8.2264
The affair could lead to an impeachment process against Trump , with the House Democrats announcing an investigation into it , accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit .	-5.7441
There is no precise timetable for impeachment ; with a majority in the House of Representatives , the Democrats could make an impeachment ; but the decision to actually impeach him would fall in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans have a majority , so the prospects for such a process are slim . No US president has yet been impeached by an impeachment procedure .	-6.9828

Musk is seeking a record extradition of Tesla	-4.1246
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record figures .	-4.2514
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries , " said Musk in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek " .	-3.7991
According to Musk ’ s circulars , Tesla ’ s demand was strong , so Tesla could place 110,000 orders , and the challenge was to bring cars quickly to .	-13.3800
In the second quarter Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars , reaching its previous record .	-5.4305
Musk needs records to reach his high goals , and in 2019 plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars in six digits in the current and next quarter year , with the most favorable Tesla Model 3 in demand , but the margins are low .	-9.2740
US Budget Revision : Once again , Only Bridge Financing	-5.3240
The new financial year will begin in the US on 1 October without a proper budget , with the Senate following the House of Representatives on Thursday and adopting transitional financing by 21 November .	-4.8999
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to raise spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years , the United States is once again on the eve of the new fiscal year , beginning on October 1 , without spending plans . The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing ( Continuing Resolution , CR ) until November 21 , without such a decision , a shutdown would have occurred on Monday at midnight , a partial closure of the federal administration .	-7.5229
Shutdown Off	-1.0856
For the time being , the federal administration will be financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the 2019 financial year ending on Monday , because Congress has not agreed on the 12 spending laws to allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities , so the federal administration cannot , for the time being , benefit from the extended spending framework for the new fiscal year from $ 1.3 trillion to $ 1.4 trillion .	-8.0881
The Democrats have completed ten of the 12 laws in the House of Representatives , which have a majority , but the spending laws reflect Democrats ’ priorities , which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate , and the Senate has also more or less ready ten of the 12 spending plans that are unlikely to win a majority .	-6.6315
In the Senate , the Republicans seem to be trying to force $ 12 billion to build a wall , one of President Trump ’ s main priorities , and the Democrats are bothered by the wall construction plans and funding that other military buildings and projects are planning to build .	-11.2508
The Divided Wall	-3.8268
At the moment , it is unclear how the parties are going to get closer to this issue ; it is more likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws over the next seven weeks that transitional funding will be extended beyond November 21 , and a shutdown will not be ruled out .	-6.9606
In view of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in good time , and the risk of a shutdown , ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity .	-9.7395
France permits artificial insemination for lesbians and singles . in , , , and , and , , and , and .	-6.5200
In France , artificial insemination is to be open to single women and lesbians : the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill requiring all women to have in vitro fertilisation , which is likely to increase demand for anonymous sperm donations .	-6.7030
In the three-day emotional debate , critics on the right had warned that many " children without a father " could grow up in the future .	-6.4106
The new regulation is the core part of a bioethics law that Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an ' opportunity ' for society , creating the modern family in which there are children with one parent or with homosexual parents , with the idea that the cost of artificial insemination for all women should be covered by social security .	-7.8082
Prohibition of sperma of dead husband	-4.2769
In the past , there have been cases in Germany in which women have complained in vain that the sperm of a deceased person has been released .	-8.9924
Many members of the ruling La République en Marche ( The Republic on the Move , LREM ) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had opposed artificial insemination with the sperma of the late partner , stressing that a widow would be " twice saddened " if her husband 's death left her wish to have children unfulfilled .	-7.6755
The initiators of the amendment , which has now failed , consider it unfair that in future a widow may be infuriated with the semen of an unknown person , but not with that of her own partner .	-10.3442
In France , artificial insemination is permitted only to heterosexual couples who cannot afford to have children , who must be married or live together for at least two years .	-10.0921
In Germany , artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples .	-3.8817

Russia Reclaims North Korean Fishermen	-1.5355
Ten days earlier , 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested and , according to the FSB , there was a fire exchange between the border guards and the boat crew , with three Russians and one North Koreans being injured and the fishermen later dying from serious injuries , but this time there were no injured .	-8.3148
Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages , with North Korean fishermen travelling in Russian territorial waters , where , according to their own data , the Russian Coast Guard patrols its marine biological resources .	-5.8941
30,000 octopus confiscated	-1.8108
In addition , according to the data , three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok .	-6.3654
Russia ’ s fisheries authorities had not issued fishing licences to North Koreans this year , even after appeals from local entrepreneurs , and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested there for a time , according to the media , this year .	-6.1499
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far East region of Primorje , Georgi Martynov , recently lamented high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen , fishing with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia , which would also bring small living beings out of the sea , and simply dispose of the nets in the sea , where they would need 200 years to be dismantled .	-7.4981

The ' most generous nation in history ' : Donald Trump , here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House .	-2.4854
The richest country in the world is closing itself off to those seeking protection : as the State Department in Washington confirms , the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be lowered further , with the aim of obtaining asylum in the future , above all , in the case of threatened believers and Iraqis .	-8.3089
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low threshold for receiving new refugees once again , with a target of 18 000 people in the marketing year 2020 , which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020 , as the US State Department has said .	-7.4159
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has slashed the acceptance of asylum seekers from around the world in recent years , with far higher admission limits under Barack Obama ’ s previous administration .	-5.9028
The target ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was launched in 1980 , yet the State Department called the US " the most merciless and generous nation in history , " a phrase strongly reminiscent of the current US president 's parlance .	-6.5263
Trump explained that “ responsible handling ” of refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild , and that supporters support his hard line on migration policy , but there is also massive criticism .	-8.1719
One major point of contention is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to close , and Trump has imposed the National Emergency to finance the construction of a border wall . Whether there is a temporal link between the current action and current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear . Trump is currently under pressure over the Selensky affair and a possible impeachment process .	-7.5937
In the future , the US Government , according to the Foreign Office , wants to focus on the admission of two refugee groups : people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are therefore in danger , as the Foreign Office statement points out , whereas a maximum of 1 500 refugees are to be received from Honduras , Guatemala and El Salvador .	-8.6595
The United States , in particular , wants people from this ' northern triangle ' of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries , and against this background the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico .	-6.5459

The novel " The Cockroach " ( original : " The Cockroach " ) will be published in German on November 27 , according to Diogenes Verlag ( Zurich ) , which deals with the transformation of a man named " Jim Sams " , who was ignored or hated in his earlier life but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain , seeing it as his mission to put the will of the people into practice , and is determined to be stopped by nothing and nobody .	-9.0663
McEwan was quoted as saying : ' When Parliament is closed , so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment , when ministers shamelessly lie as Soviet leaders once did , when high-ranking Brexiteers are almost pleading for the catastrophe of a no-deal , then a writer has to ask what he can do ; there is only one answer to this : write ' .	-7.0454

Stocking Brexit negotiations : The Danger of a Noremains .	-4.4090
In fact , Premier Boris Johnson had made a clear choice : he won ’ t guarantee a third reprieve to the Brexit negotiations ; but what has been the case for the polarizing Briton is perpetual . The recent Supreme Court ruling in Britain hovers like a sword of Damocles over the blonde , his suspension of parliament to carry out his Brexit course until the exit date was annulled early this week , and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to postpone bilateral talks until October 31 , in the event of a failed EU negotiation .	-10.3630
Boris Johnson Still Posses Deal	-1.8066
But the pressure does not seem to be palpable over Johnson either , and he has since hinted at a hospital that if he fails to do so by the end of October , he will support an extension of negotiations :	-7.3982

And time is beginning to run out of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels , with the EU and British negotiators still having some six weeks left to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement ; but the recent talks have again failed to make a breakthrough ; an agreement by the end of October seems difficult to imagine . If the British Prime Minister fails to act , a renewed postponement of the exit date is in force , and the opposition does not dare the prime minister ’ s words ; it fears that Johnson might somehow prevail in the event of a no-deal .	-10.5328

A call in Ukraine , and everything is broken ? US President Donald Trump may indeed face impeachment following the turbulent revelations of recent days ; the Democrats want to check that as soon as possible with their House inquiry – there is talk of weeks before a decision would be made .	-6.6288
At the beginning of the scandal , Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj is alleged to have made a telephone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj . The whistleblower ’ s charge , which ultimately brought the conversation to the public with his complaint out of concern for national security and democracy in the US , is monstrous : the president used his office ’ s power to exploit another country ’ s government to influence the 2020 election , using Ukraine ’ s dependence as a means of blackmail and forcing it to take action against a political opponent .	-17.1538
The core of this project is also evident in the now published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj , though it does not reflect the full text . But the July 25 phone call is only an episode of a much larger story , centered around Trump , with his personal lawyer , Rudy Giuliani .	-7.7356
From the public 's point of view , history begins in May 2019 , when Rudy Giuliani 's New York Times reports to Ukraine : he wants to meet with the newly elected President Selenskyj in Kiev , and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate . " We do not interfere in an election , we interfere in an investigation to which we are entitled , " he says to the newspaper , saying that it is inappropriate , but " nothing is illegal " .	-8.7700
The lawyer and former New York Mayor seem to have infected themselves with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump ’ s 2016 opponent : Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine , critics said at the time to create an occasion for the US Russia investigation , but that charge was never taken seriously .	-6.5961
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk about so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July . The Giulianis and president version is that Joe Biden , a former vice president and now promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy , pressed the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Attorney General , Viktor Schokin , as Ukraine ’ s envoy to the Obama administration , to stop the inquiry into the gas company that he was responsible for , in which his son , Bider , was a member of the supervisory board . Biden , who had blackmailed Ukraine financially to cover up the corrupt practices of his family .	-11.5672
In fact , when Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian Attorney General to go , investigations against the gas company had already been completed , Hunter Biden was never directly affected , and Schokin was himself deeply corrupt , the US government was far from the only Western partner to push for his dismissal , and the Obama administration explicitly supported the investigation against the company .	-11.5380

Will the British government bypass Brexit law ? Johnson reticent ?	-4.3545
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains bogged down over whether he is seeking ways to circumvent the law passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit , and , on Friday , he simply told journalists that his government would abide by the law .	-7.3796

Comet by another Star Tricks the Solar System	-4.2704

What was initially only one assumption is now confirmed : an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system .	-5.1221
The large comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter .	-5.5622

2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to gain insights into a foreign solar system from close proximity before he vanquishes in Nimmerrese.First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles that of our own system , as reported by the Astrophysics Institute of the Canaries . " The current speed of comet is high , about 150,000 kilometers per hour , which is at this distance well above the typical speeds of objects that orbit the sun , " said Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa in a communication .	-8.8034
According to the analyses , the comet is on the way to a so-called hyperBelt trajectory that takes him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin , as the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) announced , and is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies . in honour , , , , which , , was in , , and . , the , and , , and .	-11.7760

Riot in Washington : Trump Wants to find anonymous typographers in the Ukraine affair	-5.1635
In the Ukraine affair of possible abuses of US President Donald Trump wants to detect possible White House leaks .	-4.2260
“ I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information , ” Trump told US officials in New York on Thursday that the person concerned was almost “ a spy , ” and that in the past , they were “ a little differently ” than they are today .	-7.0173
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate the typographer , and the event was not actually public , but several US media outlets broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday , with Democrats reacting incensed to the President 's statement .	-14.1044
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for an impeachment procedure against Trump , based mainly on the written complaint by an anonymous intelligence worker , who makes serious accusations against Trump and his administration headquarters .	-7.6256
As part of his work , the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials that the US president " uses the power of his office " to ensure that another country interferes in the 2020 US election in his favor .	-5.8429
At the center of the charges is a contentious telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy at the end of July , in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that might harm his political rival , Joe Biden , about former deals by Biden ’ s son , Hunter , in Ukraine , and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice , leading the race for democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election .	-7.4082
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukrainian telephone call : senior government officials have tried to keep the exact wording of the call in the ceiling .	-8.3685
The " New York Times " reported that it should be a CIA foreign intelligence officer .	-4.9402
On Friday , Trump again questioned the source ’ s credibility , and in a series of tweets on the subject , the president wrote , among other things , that the “ whistleblower ” had distributed second-hand information that would have turned out to be inaccurate , so there might be no pickers or spies .	-6.4282
But , as Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have provided information to the whistleblower , outrage triggered . US House Chair Nancy Pelosi reacted alarmed and complained that Trump ’ s statement once again undermined the government ’ s integrity .	-7.0558
In the House of Representatives , various investigations against Trump and his surroundings have been underway for months in various committees , and , given Ukraine ’ s accusations , the Democrats are now pushing forward an investigation with new force to initiate a possible impeachment process against Trump .	-6.9882
“ The whistleblower has given us a road map for our investigation , ” said the head of the House ’ s intelligence committee , Adam Schiff . Trump grabbed ship , accused him of misrepresentation , and called again for the resignation of the chairman of the committee .	-6.6419
More than 300 former US security and foreign policy officials , most of whom were under Democratic , but also Republican , presidents , backed the Democrats ’ investigation that was launched on Friday for a possible impeachment process . If the allegations were true , it would Trump ’ s “ ruthless abuse of power . ”	-10.5744
There is no precise timetable for further proceedings , with a majority in the House of Representatives allowing Democrats to pursue a so-called impeachment procedure , but the decision to actually impeach him would fall in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans have a majority , so the prospects for such a process are slim . No US president has yet been impeached by an impeachment procedure .	-7.4500

According to the first findings , the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter , while at the same time the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because , as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it , the spectrum of weld patterns is similar to ours .	-11.1416

'Absolutely reprehensible ' : Rachel Johnson appalled Brother	-1.8526
In the first place , his younger brother leaves the cabinet , and now his sister clearly castigates the prime minister 's belligerent language as " distasteful . " It is not the brother she knows .	-8.6048
" capitulation " , " fraud " , " contract " : Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is continuing to arm - at least verbally - at Question in the House of Commons this , with of opposition and of dozens : dozens of bishops and his own sister , Rachel Johnson .	-7.1460
The well-known journalist and author told broadcasters Sky News that their brother uses words like capitulation , as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be " hanged , dragged , relegated , tested and flattened , " which they consider to be utterly reprehensible ; they do not recognise their brother 's version , said Rachel Johnson , who stood for the anti-Brexit Change UK party in the European Parliament elections .	-8.8261
In particular , she found that her brother , Jo Cox , mentioned an EU-friendly member of the House of Commons murdered by a neo-Nazi just days before the 2016 Brexit referendum , whose memory could best be honoured by moving through Brexit , Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons . " It is very distasteful to refer to an MEP murdered by someone who called ' Britain first ' , who now criticized Johnson 's sister , who had apparently come from the far right wing , who felt ' vindicated by this kind of language ' . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-14.6493
" It makes me sick when Jos 's name is used in this way , " he tweeted : the best way to honour her is to speak passionately and firmly in favour of what you think - no matter what you think - but never " demonize the other side " , and he also complained that an atmosphere has arisen in which attacks have become more likely .	-9.1527
Just a few weeks ago , Boris Johnson younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory deputy . " I have been torn between family loyalty and national interest in recent months - it is an unsolvable tension , " Jo Johnson founded the move .	-5.7139
Johnson 's language was also strongly criticized in the Church , and , as the Times reports , all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language " unworthy of that country .

An actor and YouTuber has appointed Egypt ’ s ruler : for the time being , Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad .	-5.1290
The two men who have influence on whether blood is again flowing on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad ; one of them returned to Cairo airport on Friday ; President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly ; the ex-general who ousted the Muslim Brotherhood Mohammed Morsi , the country ’ s first freely elected head of state , had spent a pleasant time in New York : US President Donald Trump praising his actions against political Islam and not losing a syllable about human rights violations on the Nile in a week when Egypt ’ s security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president .	-8.1184
Mohamed Ali is , of course , a foreign country , where he has escaped the security forces , who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil .	-8.9568
He was the first to be elected President of the United States , and he was elected President of the United States in 1896 .	-14.6490
After last week 's first demonstration of thousands against his rule since Sisi 's grip on power , and nearly 2,000 citizens , among them prominent figures of civil society , human rights lawyers and opposition politicians , Ali called for a " million march " this Friday .	-8.0264
On Friday , a massive police presence was reported in the city of Mansura in the Nildelta , where protesters grabbed banners with the president ’ s portrait last week , building checkpoints in the city and on the runways , closing several subway stations in downtown Cairo for “ maintenance work , ” blocking most streets around Tahrir Square , the heart of the 2011 revolution , and in the Raba Square , where supporters of the ousted Muslim Brotherhood Morsi were buried in 2013 , until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people , preventing another measure to prevent disassembly : Sisis ’ s Future Party , here , wanted a major rally for the president .	-10.3852

When Provider Promises Too Performance	-2.6243
If the internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider , there are different testing possibilities .	-4.5320
If you sign an Internet contract , you don ’ t have to trust the speed data of the providers blindly .	-6.6373
After all , the transfer rates promised in advance are an integral part of the contract and should therefore be achieved , explains the Consumer Centre of Bavaria .	-4.3658
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider , there are various testing possibilities , for example , the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency ( Bnetza ) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract .	-6.3591
" Die Tests der Anbieter erfolgen jedoch nach bürger-specific Voraussetzungen und sind daher nicht eineineinsam und objective berechnet " , stellt die Verbraucherzentrale Bayern auf ihrer Seite zu berücken .	-7.7873
If the connection is considerably slower than announced , customers may set a reasonable time limit of usually 14 days to manufacture the promised service .	-5.9995
If this does not happen even after multiple requests , customers can cancel and may also claim damages , but if the success fails , only the plaintiff will be able to help .	-9.5230
First High Republicans for Investigation	-3.1585
" I think the investigation is important , yes , and where it goes from here is determined by the facts to be found , " said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday , who wanted to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the removal of the president .	-5.8260
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine , because Trump has been watching Biden " for years . "	-5.5272
Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the Whistleblower affair ; few have signaled unease about it . Scott ’ s statements are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party . Scott , a moderate Republican , has repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies , such as relaxing environmental legislation and tightening immigration rules .	-6.2717

In the final , Duchess Meghan did not return for a final farewell greeting as Rachel Zane , at least not for new scenes . Instead , some of the backdrops once again showed the most memorable scenes with today ’ s Duchess , such as the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his ousted sentence .	-7.5584

The boat sank near the Greek island of Invousses , which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland , saving four children , three women and five men .	-4.0200
At present , hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean , which , according to the United Nations Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ) , killed 174 people last year , and the Federal Minister of the Interior , Horst Seehofer , has now announced plans to visit both countries .	-6.3365

The increased figures have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement , which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who illegally pass through Turkey to the Greek islands , in exchange for the EU ’ s desire to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for any Syrian who has been deported .	-7.2482

The National Post then accused May of manipulation , and that the party produced fake news to appear more credible on “ environmental protection , ” in the midst of an underhouse election campaign , in which Trudeau , too , is finding it increasingly difficult to get involved in a bribery scandal .	-7.3760
The photo was viral in the social media and sparked the discussion about fake news .	-6.0431
May was shocked and prayed on her blog that she didn ’ t know about this action , but to underline that she immediately put the original one : she , in conversation with citizens , had a cup in her hand , but she was right to say that she was from bamboo .	-11.0223
" I don 't want to call him stupid , but there was nothing to hide , " she told the Guardiansand , at the same time , asked herself something of her over-committed team : " If they want to edit a picture again , could they not do what with my face , so I look younger ? "	-7.7285

Influencers want free upgrade : Lifelong flight ban on Cathay .	-4.8261
Jaqueline Ng was reportedly assured that she would upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific , but when she asked for it at check-in she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay Pacific again .	-7.0577
Business class upgrades are offered immediately - many passengers dream of them , sometimes lucky , and the staff at check-in offer free travel from Economy Class .	-9.0034
The airline Cathay Pacific has actively requested a free upgrade , with more than 65,000 users following Instagram , followed by Jaqueline Ng on May 30 , 2008 to New York and June 7 .	-8.1876
Jaqueline refused to upgrade on the flight , although she reported a mail saying that her Cathay Pacific was planning to upgrade .	-14.4882
Jaqueline , a former member of the JFK team , was forced to leave Jaqueline for the next two years , and Jaqueline , a former member of the JFK team , was forced to resign from Jaqueline .	-17.4948
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaqueline Ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific .	-5.7204
In her case , she turned to Elliot Advocacy , a company representing consumer interests , because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket , but Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket .	-6.7299
But as long as Jaqueline does not provide the metadata of the mail , the case remains clear : Cathay has been scammed by the influenza woman , she remains blocked for future flights , and the airline ’ s terms and conditions state that she does not have to pay for the new flight .	-8.7596
Oil Prices After Report on Armistice in Yemen	-6.0909
On Friday afternoon , oil prices dropped by more than one dollar in a very short space of time ; last , a barrel ( 159 liters ) of the North Sea Brent cost $ 61.83 – about 1.4 % less than the previous day ; the price of a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) fell by 1.3 % to $ 55.77 .	-6.8499
The slide was triggered by the Wall Street Journal ’ s report on a ceasefire in Yemen , which Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas .	-4.2533
In mid-September , a drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil facilities had stalled 5 % of global oil production , with Iranian-allied Huthi rebels in Yemen ’ s civil war calling for the attacks . Saudi Arabia , like the US government , blames Iran , and a ceasefire would defuse the region ’ s political tension .	-7.2093
If an agreement is reached , it can focus on growth and demand , said Ole Hansen , leader of the Commodity Strategy Division at the Saxo Bank of Bloomberg news agency .	-4.7356
A week ago , a barrel of WTI oil cost nearly $ 59 , Brent nearly $ 65 .	-3.7616
Most recently , Bloomberg , citing insiders , reported that oil repair works in Saudi Arabia are moving faster than anticipated after the attack in mid-September , so that output has returned to eight million barrels a day , moving back toward the original quantity .	-7.1743
Most recently , there have been several press releases , citing insiders who report rapid advances in repair work by Saudi Aramco , the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco , but raw materials experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock exchange and wants to avoid negative headlines .	-7.8595
At the same time , the conflict between Iran and Western countries has been somewhat relaxed : the British oil tanker Stena Impero is on the way to leaving the port more than two months after Iran ’ s launch and the recently issued clearance , with the crew preparing to leave while the ship is still at anchor , according to shipping chief Erik Hånell , in an SMS message to Swedish radio on Friday morning .	-9.6881
But the US announced that it would transfer defense missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia as Iran ’ s arch-enemy . Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom had temporarily boosted oil prices significantly in recent weeks .	-5.6816

North Korea ’ s Third Trump and Kim Summits	-3.3805
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be held in the nuclear dispute . The purpose and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in implementing first-summit agreements in Singapore , said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday , according to KCNA .	-6.4685
The US would not have done anything to implement last year 's summit decisions , said North Korean State Department adviser , criticizing increased US sanctions and joint military maneuvers by the US and South Korea , but hoping for a " wise " and " courageous " decision by Trump to return to rapprochement .	-7.1261
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know first what a third summit with Kim was supposed to bring before he agreed to do so . Negotiations to disarm North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second Trump and Kim summit in Hanoi in February , and both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas in June , agreeing to revive the talks , but with little success .	-6.8134

Last week , the Bank of England had already pointed out the economic burden of the Brexit shock without directly signaling an interest rate cut , with Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanting to lead his country from the EU on October 31 , even without a divorce agreement .	-6.2808

Doping Other Russian Manipulation	-3.2092
Material from the analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman , a former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( Wada ) and today 's chief of integrity of the World Association of Athletics .	-5.7640
New details of the doping scandal are emerging in Russia at the start of the World Athletics Championships – and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and even in some way . In January 2019 , the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency ( Wada ) .	-6.5423
In December 2014 , systematic cheating in Russian sports had been revealed , and the Wada had closed the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( Rusada ) for three years . During that time , Russian athletes were not banned entirely from the world stage ; the International Olympic Committee , after an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio , had some 270 athletes under a neutral flag , and 168 Russian athletes were on the start at the Winter Games in February 2018 .	-8.9643
Positive findings lack	-3.0941
In the following September , the Wada again called on the Rusada man , but called for access to the laboratory and the samples in question .	-9.2817
The president of the Independent Integrity Commission ( AIU ) of the World Athletics Federation ( IAAF ) has now confirmed that the doping data has been manipulated from the Moscow analysis laboratory . " Yes , we the data nine months ago and we should check to to , " said David in " Frankfurter " " " " " " " " " " .	-14.4944
The World Cup Not Attached	-2.3374
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF : the Athletics Association is the only organisation that holds a ban on Russia .	-6.9683
At the beginning of this week , Wada had already begun manipulations and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks , with Russia now threatening to freeze the Rusada again and , in the worst case , to exclude it from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo .	-7.3638
