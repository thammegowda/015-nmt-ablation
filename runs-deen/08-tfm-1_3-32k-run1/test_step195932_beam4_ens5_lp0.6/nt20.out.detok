Clearing fire in French Chemical Works
The fire broke out on Thursday at night, and the fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire-fighting vehicles.
Fire could be stopped
On Thursday, the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants and is part of the Lubrizol company of US billionaires Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemical factory already produced headlines in the past, for example, when a leak escaped Methanthiol in 2013, and the surrounding area stretched to lazy eggs.

Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iran's Port
For more than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday, and,, and, as the port of Rashiin the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian Government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters, and it was said from shipping that it wanted to wait for an official announcement from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was raised on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the Hormuz Sea Road, under the charge of violating security rules, but it was assumed that Iran responded to the controversial temporary suspension of an Iranian oil tanker before the British Gibraltar.
Hormuz Street is one of the world ’ s most important maritime routes, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean, and a large part of global oil exports are shipped by the strait.

Musk ’ s Delivery Record
Tesla ’ s quarter may hold record, but despite the delivery boom, there have been losses to the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock market. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", wrote Musk in an e-mail published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.
Tesla has a strong demand, so that Tesla could make 110000 orders, said Musk ’ s circular letter, and the challenge is to bring cars quickly to the clientele, which requires Teslato provide as many as.
In the second quarter, Tesla delivered 95,000 cars and thus achieved its current best.
Musk needs recorders to achieve its high goals, and in 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars, which requires six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter of the year, especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3, but the profit margins are low.
Conundrum: That is why we cannot fool ourselves.
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from being able to chew themselves, as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments at rats, as they said on Thursday evening, and progress has also been made on the question of why children are so fiercely opposed to kite, only to demand more.
After all, it has also been shown why the sewing of a kitten hand is already causing laughter before touching, which is due to a deep layer in the large hirry that is already causing laughter when the kitten is expected.
According to previous research, rats with "laughter" in the ultrasound area were shown to be carved by people, and this "laughter" is conveyed by the part of the large brain drain which the central processing of haptic perception is carried out.
Lachen is suppressed during self-touch.
It was assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - that is, people cannot chew themselves, but Berlin researchers have now found out in the experiments at the rats that laughter, like the activity of the area in question, is suppressed during self-touch, even if living beings themselves plaster.
However, if the self-touch and touch are suppressed by others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed, suggesting that the brain of the rats cannot distinguish between self-touch and touch by others.
In addition, the rats have been trained to chew themselves, so they sometimes broke this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showed escape behaviour or horror.

Brexit: Johnson of his sister criticized
The premier ’ s sister commented Boris Johnson ’ s speech at the first session in Parliament after the forced break on Wednesday evening, threatening to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement, if Brussels does not agree to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement, but how he wants to achieve that is unclear.
On Cox, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: 'The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and reconnect this country would be to leave the EU'.

Iran Free British Tankers
The UN General Debate did not resolve the Iran conflict, but now there is a problem less: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero", held in Iran, could be back at sea, a puzzle door in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been stuck in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters.
The "Stena Impero" have left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now travelling to Dubai for medical examinations, said Chief Executive Erik Hånell.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tankers on 19 July under the charge of disregarding the provisions of the Law of the Sea in the Persian Gulf; seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September; the remaining 16 crew members would, and,,, said Hånell, in the face of the difficult and exciting situation that has taken over over the last ten weeks, and the shipping company are now working to reconciwith their families as quickly..
The British Government suspected, behind the establishment of the Stena Impero, a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar: in early July, a supertanker with oil from Iran intended for Syria was placed on the chain, according to the authorities, against EU sanctions against Syria, which the British had received from the United States.
Iran spoke of 'piracy' and threatened with consequences; in mid-August, the 'Adrian Darya-1' was finally released, and London was vehemently rejected.
Hormus Street is one of the world ’ s most important maritime routes, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean, and much of the world ’ s oil exports are shipped by the strait.
Iran ’ s nuclear dispute stems from the tensions between Tehran and Washington, with the Americans accusing Iran of building nuclear weapons; Iran rejects that; the US has unilaterally withdrawn from the international nuclear deal in 2018, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb, while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on Tehran ’ s leaders to impose a stricter and extended agreement on other areas.
Because of the dispute over the Stena Impero and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of commercial vessels in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York, with the '' Coalition of for the Persian Gulf, with and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
India has a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India would actually be predestined to be the "war profiter", but, given the tariffs imposed by America's President Donald Trump against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to rescind, with financial chefs of Asian firms considering relocating their production from China to another country, India appears to be one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey, which, of course, has not only done with the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war.
But now India itself is in Trump ’ s focus, devaluing from the whiff in the Weissen House as the “Kingdom of Tariffs ”, America has deprived the emerging country of trade benefits for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The US has accused India of prohibitively high tariffs and demand better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, however, the friction with India is merely a side-show, and America also looks at the world ’ s largest democracy through security glasses. Delhi and Washington combine concern about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean, with a Salve of American tariffs on India unlikely.
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically upset thesis that open markets speed up economic development has a severe state of affairs in the Socialist Republic of India, including under Modi, whose reform zeal is aimed mainly at the bureaucratic madness that has been stifling in the multi-ethnic state for too long any entrepreneurial spirit, and firms now receive rapid construction subsidies for construction,, and a more insand bankruptcy law creates conditions for firms to with high.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings, and in the first five Modi years, India ’ s economic optics have turned a lot for the better. But trade policy does not mean protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the National Conservative Government has even created new barriers.
In the West, Modi of the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country, owing not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At the core, however, the "India First" Advocate has never been dictated by a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian firms from getting rid of anachronistic processes and thus becoming fit for global competition.
Appointment of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
The former President of France, Jacques Chirac, is said to have written a report next week in Paris, and the former head of state will be buried at Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the AFP news agency reported to the Chiracs family on Monday.
The first secret hero of the athletic World Cup is to bring the rivals to the.
In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to swear dangerously in an unhealthy position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country suddenly shut him down and put him behind the last half stage round of the stadium.
"I just wanted to help him, everyone in this situation would have done the same", said Dabo, after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly drew the attention of the assembled journalists.
He did so in the evening with vigour - and much more intensively than he would have thought, because this heroism will be remembered, even if Dabo had made his rival Busby the goal and voluntarily took over the last place - well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this race.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied in Lisbon, was here to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha.
Millionenmasch: Egyptians are preparing for a wild day of protest.
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the run-up to possible anti-government protests, and a reinforced police presence was observed in central Cairo on Friday, with closed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the past few days, the police had stepped up their road controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians had been partially searched for news and photos in connection with the protests.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there were hundreds of people protesting against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ’ s government, criticizing corruption and mismanagement, and there was such an open protest against political leadership in Egypt for years.
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) held more than 1,570 arrests by Friday; the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that more than 2,000 arrests were not confirmed by the government, and commented on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily arrested" only because they were 'in the wrong place' at the wrong time, "said HRW, referring to lawyers of solicitors, and allegations against the detainees range from" dissemination of false information "to membership in a" terrorist association ".
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, so the government in Cairo blocked websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Shipping merchants should be able to donate returns more easily.
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost and around 20 million returns end up on waste, but there is an alternative.
The Treasury has shown online traders like Amazon and Zalando a way of donating returned products instead of destroying them.
While companies could not be exempted from VAT on material donations, the ministry declared on a matter of the Green Bundestag fraction, which newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday, traders could set the market value of unbuy-back tours so low that they would not have to pay a tax on sales or just a little.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg found that, when orders are made on the Internet, the German citizens are returning each sixth package.
Green group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called for Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies cannot evaluate unsold products and donate them to non-profit organizations free of charge.
Banksy-Kunst to auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting.
The famous work of Streetart-Star Banksy, Devolved Parliament, is due to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksys's work "underlines the repatriation of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic posture of animals and tribes".
The work was first exhibited in the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of Britain, where Banksy lives.
The image could change the owner for a million-day.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday following the removal of a forced break imposed by the Supreme Court, delivered a hard exchange of news with the opposition, and Johnson wants to complete the Brexit Brexit that has already been postponed twice on 31 October, even without agreements with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is interfering in the Brexit debate; in Dover in the south-east of England, he painted an image that is a man breaking a star of the European flag with a bite; thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors arrive to the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The strong verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexiteers in Parliament do not, according to his top adviser, contribute to a climate of hatred. In comparison to the campaign prior to the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park", Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation.
Johnson had attacked Brexiteers in Parliament hard in recent days and accused them, among other things, of 'betrayal' on the people, accusing them of putting Members at risk because they could, for example, become the target of death threats, he did as' humbug '.
Cummings said that the only way to get calm again is for MEPs to finally respect the British ’ s decision to leave the EU, and it is not surprising that people were upset that Britain was still not out of the EU three years after the referendum.
On Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. "We should speak with respect," said a statement. "And we should.
Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno Intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again urged the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the United Nations General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno General debate in New York. "If it is going badly, we hope for the best, but are prepared for the worst," the United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them in order to control the divided Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers control part of Kashmir, another part of which belongs to China.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the fall of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The current protests in Egypt have been a tough response by the government, with harsh munitions firing on the population, with more than 2000 prisoners being held in prisons on the 60,000 political prisoners who are already there, and protest has never been harmless in Egypt, but since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ’ s takeover in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation; poverty, lack of prospects, and the feeling of being stifled by their own government is driving millions to the streets, and that is a problem that the el-Sisi regime is not getting under control, no matter how hard it is against adversaries.
Today, every third in Egypt lives below the poverty line; since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is 10%, and anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide whom to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola, or the military, which is not only responsible for repression but also the largest economic actor; the military is building roads, houses, football stadiums, producing food, and much more.
Tüv checks at the terminal: BER-Chef: No "Showstopper" more for the main airport airport.
Two months have been investigated whether the complex plant mesh works in conjunction with BER edge protection, but the operator is satisfied with the course, but the Tüv is.
After large-scale Tüv-examinations in the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening in October of next year, which is safe, said head of the supervisory board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control panel.
airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful examination, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many but we do not have a real showstopper, he assured,,, and buffer.
There are indications, however, that the temporary reserve should no longer be too large, and the construction work display should now be submitted to the construction office in the course of the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables are still to be resolved; the Tüv wants to examine them until February; 'In order to create the conditions for the commencement of air operations, we must continue to work intensively on dealing with the shortcomings', a written communication stated.
Liège Daldrup said that, in many cases, there is a lack of evidence, less about new cables, and there is no release for all the nozzles on which cable roads hang.
In addition, fire protection at the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily, and the problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago, this time it is a matter of smoke plunging down as a fire like a canvas, so that the smoke does not spread out too far, and 36 engines must therefore be exchanged at the beginning of the year, and there should be new attempts at hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Since the beginning of 2006, the costs have increased from €6.5 billion to €6.5 billion to the opening of next year.
Since passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport, which is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October should take place, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new Managing Directors, Finance Director Heike Fölster is switching to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said.
Chemnitz: Drugs Automated - Police arrested man.
He needed money for drugs - and jailed several vending machines in the Chemnitz city area in the air!

Study of causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, but what does a cardiovascular weakness or an infarction really mean?
Through the analysis of the genetic heritage of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to trace the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the university hospital in Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday.
In the course of this study, the study was conducted at the University of Applied Sciences in Munich, Germany.
At present, more than 4,000 of the roughly 20,000 relevant human genes are known for the possible pathogenic changes in DNA - so-called mutations - were reported by the clinic.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks, and data could also be used in research into other popular diseases, such as Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University of Herz- und Gefäßzentrums.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong desire to use the data to research other diseases.
The Bioprobes of healthy participants come from Hamburgern, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study".
According to UKE, the inheritance of a human being can be decrypted within 24 hours, with the pure material cost of this at EUR 1300, the first gene sequencing in the world, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros, and the study is due to begin on 1 October, and all 9000 samples are expected to be analysed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a coral school, and after detecting residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the underage victims, such as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo.
The young were detained on the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and being "blessed"; in fact, the apprentices were detained by their teachers under "most degrading and inhumane conditions", said Sabo.
According to the figures, the coral reef had been in existence for about ten years, and the authorities would have drawn attention to repeated irregularities in the establishment, and the parents would have been shocked when they were informed of the conditions in the coral reef, said Sabo, who had no idea of the suffering of their children; the operator and six staff were arrested according to the police.
There are many private coral reefs in Nigeria ’ s predominantly Muslim north, replacing the often deficient state facilities; the region ’ s people are suffering from frequent attacks by armed gangs; according to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in Niger ’ s neighboring state in the last decade.
Armed and tortured: Nigeria ’ s police frees 400 children from school.
Policists have freed almost 400 students from appalling conditions in a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries pointing to torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There, the children were discovered on Thursday after an announcement in an Islamic school, and the conditions there were 'inhumane'; officials arrested the head of the school and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were kept as slaves at their school and placed at chains, some of whom were sexually abused.
World Football Election: Further allegations of Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi, and Megan Rapinoe,
With a Gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year.
After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football election, other countries have allegations to the Fifa, and Egypt has not been treated with a curious explanation.
Much of the Fifa has proven to be anathema over the past few years: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its president, Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials, but the Fifa World Football election has not yet been suspected of going unneatly - if one disregards the fact that the voting national trainers and national team captains of the member associations often vote more according to sympathy than objectively.
But, having already complained about Nicaragua ’ s captain, he did not vote at all, more inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national trainers Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account; indeed, they are not in official and publicly.
The Fifa apologizes that 'signatures have been made on the electoral forms in capital letters and have therefore not been valid', and that the Egyptian Association has been contacted on several occasions to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudans Trainer also surprised
There is also an outcry from Sudan in respect of the election; while the situation in Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally judged: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three; according to Fifa, the vote was just as much as it was, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Association.
Nicaraguan captain Juan Barrera also raised charges: "Did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards, all of which I am wrong," he wrote.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Friday there was a message from the Association: yes, but there was no intention, of course, but the completed electoral documents were 'mistakenly' with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, said it in a communication from the Federation, but it was actually the second captain, Manuel Rosas. 'We take responsibility for the administrative error', stated in the communication.
The other cases are now investigating Fifa, but emphasizes that the election process has been supervised by the consultancy company PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
Ukrainian affair: Ranghohe Republicans are in favour of official investigation.
Two senior Republicans have openly declared themselves in favor of an official investigation against US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the US state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this is from here, the facts are determined" He wants to know more about the whistleblower-affair before action can be taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, according to Scott Biden.
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the whistleblowers affair, so few have shown unease, and Scott ’ s remarks are now a first sign of Trump ’ s party ’ s moderate governor, Virginia, has repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules.
As another ranghoher Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, spoke for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter, and.
Scott and Baker formally did not participate in the process against Trump, which will be decided in Congress, and their statements are, above all, symbolic; however, the Republicans ’ first senators were critical of the situation; Mitt Romney, for example, who represents Utah ’ s federal state in the second chamber of parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing," as US media report that the Republicans themselves had first cracks internally.
The affair could result in the launch of an impeachment procedure against Trump, the Democrats in the House have announced an enquiry, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment process, with a majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment, but the decision on a real impeachment would be in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority, so the prospects for such a process ’ s success are low, and so far no US president has been removed from the office ’ s impeachment procedure.
Goods Folterer on Board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they have been raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after being fired on the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 lybischen refugees.
New serious accusations of racketeering are now being made, so three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3"; the suspects have been caught in a detention camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recovered their peinists in Italy. "We cannot exclude this," ", said Sea Ruben Neugebauer of the German press..
In mid-September, the police reported that the suspects had raped, tortured, and even claimed in the North African country, Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "Migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - repeated and constant physical violence,.
NGO and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships, 'we cannot scan who is the people, who come without passports', said that torture is one of the main reasons why the people of Libya are fleeing, so it is quite likely that the criminals are on the ships', so it is very important that this is done '.
Italy ’ s right-wing ex-Interior Minister Matteo Salvini called for an apology from Rackete, who is still being identified in Italy for helping illegal immigration.
Musk aspires to Tesla ’ s Delivery
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a powerful boost with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", wrote Musk in an e-mail published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.
Tesla has a strong demand for 110,000 orders, and Musk ’ s circular letter told us that the challenge is to.
In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars and thus achieved its record.
Musk needs recorders to achieve its high goals, and in 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars.
US budget dispute: Once again, only bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget, and the Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, the United States is once again on the eve of the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October, with the Senate having followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided to provide transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November, without such a decision, it would have come to a shutdown on Monday, a division of the federal administration.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the Federal Government will now be financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019 that will end on Monday, because Congress cannot agree on the 12 spending laws that allocate funds to the various departments and authorities, so the Federal Government cannot, for the time being, benefit from the 1.3 Bio budget for the new financial year.
The Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, have completed ten of the 12 laws, but the spending laws reflect the Democrats ’ priorities, which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate has also made ten of the 12 spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly capable of majority voting.
In the Senate, Republicans seem to try to force $12 billion for the Mauerbau, one of President Trump ’ s big priorities, disrupting the Mauerbau Wall plans and financing that is actually planned for other military buildings and projects.
The Ghosts of Mauerbau are Different
At present, it is unclear how the parties are going to come closer to this issue, and it is more likely that agreement will be extended to all 12 spending laws in the next seven weeks, extending transitional funding beyond 21 November, and a shutdown is not excluded.
In the context of the ongoing inability of the Congress to agree on the 12 spending laws in good time, and the associated risk of a shutdown will win ideas to automate the process to popularity.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization will continue to be open to single women and lesbians: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill, whereby all women can take advantage of an in-vitro fertilization, so that demand for anonymous sperm can increase significantly.
In the three-day emotional debate, right-wing critics warned that many "children without father" could grow up in the future, and the French Bishop Conference is against innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a Bioethics Act, which was defended by the Minister for Health, Agnès Buzyn, as a 'chance' for society; it was the modern family in which children with only one parent or homosexual parents were given, and the costs of artificial fertilisation for all women are to be borne by social security.
Closing with sperm of dead husband further prohibited
By contrast, with a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would allow widows to have artificial fertility access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain, and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization "post-mortem" was allowed.
Many members of the governing La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had, on the other hand, voted in favour of artificial fertilisation with the sperm of the deceased partner, who stressed that a widow would be subject to a "double trauma" if, by the death of her husband, her desire for child.
The initiators of the now failed amendment find it unfair that a widow can be fertile in the future with the sperm of a unknown, but not with the one of her own partners.
To date, artificial fertilization in France has only allowed heterosexual couples who cannot witness children; they must be married or live together for at least two years; Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogate motherhood remains banned.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, it is often difficult.
Compensation for the climate: call for flight charges for Unis will be louder.
There will be a lot of flowering at universities, which is why, in future, the country wants to keep a climate tax there, and the rectors say that they have no money for it, but now they are under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying; photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte.
The debate on a climate levy on flights from universities and universities postponed before the summer recess has been postponed again, and after the national rector conference sceptically reacted to an appropriate push from the green / black coalition, the plans now receive support from universities, and in a joint declaration the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical college for compensation of service flights, which is urgently needed as a first step, and at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, that is, in its opinion, originally planned in July, because the CDU has still not approved the CDU.
Russia Recognizes North Korea ’ s Fishermen
According to the secret service FSB, detainees were to be illegally caught in Russian waters, with 161 fishermen already being arrested from North Korea, when there was a shooting shift between border guards and boat crew, with three Russians and a North Koreans being injured later, but the fishermen were not injured.
The Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages, so North Korean fishermen were on the way to Russian territorial waters, where, according to their own data, the coastguard of Russia is patrolling their Mexican biological resources.
30,000 Tin Fish confiscated
In the case of further controls, 30,000 octopus were discovered and confiscated on the boats, and the claims were confiscated according to three fishing boats and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet by Vladivostok.
Russia ’ s fisheries authority had not spent fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs, with thousands of North Korea ’ s fishermen being arrested temporarily this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently lamented high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who fished with synthetic nets banned in Russia, which would also remove small creatures from the sea, and would simply dispose of nets in the sea where they needed 200 years to be crushed.
In future, only 18,000: the US lowers asylum ceiling.
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected White House police representatives.
The richest country in the world is closing itself to defensive seekers: as Washington State Department confirms, the ceiling for the legal move of refugees is further reduced, and in the future, particularly endangered creditors and Iraqis are to be granted asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees once again, and in the 2020 financial year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, the maximum number of 18,000 people is to be left in the country, as the US State Department has said.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has drastically reduced the readiness to accept protectionists from around the world over the past few years, with much higher revenue limits under Barack Obama ’ s previous administration.
The estimated upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was launched in 1980, but the US Department of Foreign Affairs described it as "the most impoverished and generous nation in history", a phrase strongly reminiscent of the language used by the current US president.
A 'responsible handling' of refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild them, Trump has said, but there is also massive criticism for his tough approach to migration policy.
A major contentious point is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to regulate, and, in order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency, whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the US capital, Trump is unclear, and is,, and.
The US government wants to focus in future on the reception of two refugee groups, according to the outpost office: people persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who helped the US military in the country, thereby endangering the country, as the Foreign Ministry ’ s statement states.
The US wants people from this' northern triangle 'of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries, and with this in mind, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.

Lifelong ban on Racism in Italy
As a result of racist comments about soccer profile Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital imposed a life-long stadium ban on a fan.
The club reacted late on Thursday, announcing the fans' account at Instagram and the police, and the Roma supporters should never again visit a game of the club, the club wrote on Twitter.

Conflict between Iran and the US: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump is against him.
Following his return from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged offer by the US to lift sanctions, and the United States, in exchange for talks with Tehran leaders, promised an end to all sanctions on its official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted Iran's counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to raise the sanctions imposed on it so that there is a meeting, I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes what happened: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting should take place. "And America says, I lever the sanctions on", added Ruhani, the kind of punitive measures that should be brought to an end, "and they clearly, we lift all.
However, this move was not carried out in an acceptable way, criticized Ruhani, and no one could predict the outcome of negotiations, given the current penalties and 'the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure'.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York, with the hope of Europeans to rescue the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China, which is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France ’ s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 offspring
As Western Turkey has been shaken by two earthquakes in the shortest possible time, fear of disaster is growing, and 34 people have been injured in the earthquake on Tuesday, and, since the earthquake last day, Turkey ’ s Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday, with concern.
The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmararegion before Istanbul on Thursday, triggering panic in the metropolis of millions, and now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul ’ s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored.,, among other by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly disrupt Istanbul.
City planners, like the famous architect Mücella Yapici, have long warned that large open spaces registered in the centre as a refuge have been built.
The epicenter of the earthquake of Thursday was located in Marmara, in front of the Silivri district, and in about seven kilometres deep, as the Afad Civil Protection Agency announced, a smaller aftershocks a few minutes later, caused even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu shared on Twitter, wounded or damage had not been reported.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly endangered, with a section of the so-called North-Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between Eurasian and Anatolian Earth Plate.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude could threaten 7.1 to 7.4, but when the earthquake occurs, it is unclear that the earthquake on Thursday has already hit the West of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private individuals have packed so called go-tags with everything needed to stand next to house doors, and schools bring children to behave as they behave when the earth wakes up.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured; some buildings had suffered slight damage; the Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed developments from the Istanbul Civil Coordination Centre (Akom), which reported two mosques stormed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.

According to CNN Turkey, only a few minutes after the first earthquake, the date of the earthquake is indicated at 1.59 p.m. (local time).
Just on Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara Region - it was felt until Istanbul, and its epicenter was located in Marmara, west of the metropolis of millions, the Afad civil protection authority informed Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul could occur sooner or later - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high; scientists believe that they -, causing massive damage.
He said that the earthquake is now more likely to be CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a major earthquake", Ersoy said.
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul, and there were 68 injured in Albania only a few days ago - and there were 68 injured on Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New Fuel in Ukraine
Two brilliant documents provide new fuse in the Ukrainian affair about the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, and a possible impeachment process has encouraged US Democrats: the complaint lodged by an anonymous referee about Trump and his controversial telephone call with the Ukrainian president sees important evidence for investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself as the victim of a "witch-hunt", as well as questioning the credibility of whistleblowers.

The Kakerlake: Inspired by Kafka, Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous narrative "Die Verwandlung", the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on 27 November, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich), which deals with the transformation of a man called "Jim Sams", who was ignored or obeyed in his previous life, but is now Britain's most powerful man, who sees it as his mission to turn the will of the people into reality, by nothing.
McEwan was quoted in the words: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment when ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leader when Brexiteers in high positions summoned the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask what he can do, and there is only one answer: write".
Kafka's first published narrative, published in 1915 by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "as a tremendous unselective", is gradually excluded from family and society, and finally perished. "Ian McEwan talks about Kafka to describe a world that stands head," was said by Diogenes Verlag.

The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all journeys until 31 October 2019.

Thomas Cook in Germany was in the wake of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed insolvency applications on Wednesday.
Insurers now want to transfer money back to hotels.
On the other hand, from this Friday hotels abroad, which are still hosting Thomas-Cook holidaymakers, should receive money from the Zurich-Versicherung.
On the basis of the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich-spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels are not asked for individual payment of hotel invoices or otherwise required", said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The German Travel Association (DRV) and the German Association of Consumer Centres had been strongly critical of this. on, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As many hotels are affected, on Friday the insolvent travel provider voted, the insurance provider said, according to information from Thursday, 70 000 Thomas-Cook holidaymakers from Germany were on the way.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced withdrawals to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are still on the way, and for Thomas-Cook customers who are still on holiday, it looks bad.
As the company is open to travel starting on November 1, 2019, and in coordination with insolvency insurance, the company will examine the further course of action.
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera.
Prince Harry destroys Sprengmine in Angola
For a long time now, Prince Harry continues the commitment of Lady Diana, and in Africa, he is now moving directly on the tracks of his mother.

Stocking Brexit Negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute.
In fact, Premier Boris Johnson had clearly defined himself: he will not guarantee a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements have been made in the polarizing Britons for eternal duration. The recent verdict of the Supreme Court in Britain floated like a sword of Damocles above the blondshopf.
Boris Johnson believes Deal is still possible.
But the pressure does not seem to be noticeably over Johnson, and in the meantime, when he visited a hospital, he suggested that, if the negotiations were not agreed, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
Do you know that we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal, I am cautiously optimistic that it.
And the time is beginning to run away from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels, with the EU and British negotiators still having time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without agreements, yet the recent talks have again failed to achieve a breakthrough; an agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine; if the British Prime Minister does not comply with the law, a renewed postponement of the exit date will come into force, but the opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister, fearing that Johnson might somehow enforce the Brexit deal.

A call in Ukraine, and all is broken, after the turbulent revelations of recent days, US President Donald Trump could indeed be confronted with an impeachment procedure that Democrats want to examine as quickly as possible with their enquiry in the House of Representatives - the question is of weeks until a decision is made.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is supposed to be the beginning of the scandal: the accusation of whistleblowers, who abused the conversation from concern for national security and for the democracy of the United States with his complaint, is monstrous: the president has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for influencing the election in 2020; he has exploited Ukraine ’ s dependence in such a way as to force them to act against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also in the now published signature of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text, but the phone of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger history, in whose center is next to Trump his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
History starts from the public's point of view in May 2019 when Rudy Giuliani's New York Times reports travel plans to Ukraine, and he wants to meet with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We are not meddling in an election, we are meddling in an investigation of what we have the right to do," he says, it is inappropriate, but "nothing is illegal".
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been plagued by right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump ’ s opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton has colluded with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia ’ s investigations in the US, but this charge has never been taken seriously.
The Giulianis and the President version of the former vice-president and currently promising candidates for the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, has urged the dismissal of the then Ukrainian general prosecutor, Viktor Schokin, to stop the investigation he was responsible for by the gas company, whose son Hunter Biden, was a senior bidder.
In fact, the process was slightly different, and when Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian Prosecutor to go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected, and Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt practices, the US government was far from the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal; moreover, the Obama administration explicitly supported the investigation against the company.

In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year, and the perpetrators are often farmers in which the animals had previously been held harmless, while around 50 people are killed each year by elephants, usually when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
In Sri Lanka, it is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants live, and in theory the death penalty is the death penalty.

Elon Musk has raised Tesla shares
This wrote Musk in an email published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla staff.
The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customer, so that Tesla has to provide as many resources as possible to quarterly send.
For almost four months, Tesla ’ s shares delivered more than 95 ’ 000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its current value.
Musk needs record numbers to achieve its high goals, and in 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360 '000 to 400' 000 cars, and six digits must be produced in the current and next quarter of the year.
Will Britain ’ s government bypass Brexit law? Johnson cautiously?
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the recently adopted law against unregulated Brexit, and, on a related question, he simply told journalists on Friday that his government will abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the withdrawal deadline, should not reach an agreement with the EU by mid-October, and Johnson criticises this as the 'capitulation law' that opens up negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister, John Major, said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law; Johnson could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after leaving the EU.
Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union 'We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way to do so is to reach an agreement'.
Iran evidently drives uranium enrichment high
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on European contracting partners in the dispute over saving the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states are unwilling or unwilling to take concrete action," said Rowhani at a press conference on Thursday at the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York.
The conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, in return, contained the commitment to normalize economic relations. The US, on its own, grew out of the agreement in 2018 to force Iran to change its course with "maximum pressure" towards a change of course in the Middle East policy deemed aggressive. President Donald Trump a agreement with tougher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September for use, and according to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 further centrifuges.
Perhaps Europeans are not prepared to carry their share of the deal, and so left Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of crushing US sanctions, Rohani presumed, but there will be further talks that hopefully would bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to contest Iran ’ s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the Gemengelage has changed: Germany, France, and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran were known in Yemen to, but as a.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence," Rouhani said, but the European leaders would not have done so during the UN general debate; instead, they would only have invoked that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the US administration ’ s far-reaching sanctions would have to be lifted, Rouhani demanded that the Washington administration move toward a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet of other star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the deep of the world, which was,,, and.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What was initially only a suspicion is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system.
On August 30, the farthest comet was discovered by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow on the Margo-Observatory on Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres diameter.
2I / Borisov is the second interstellar object after 1I / 'Oumuamua in 2017 that was spotted on a flight of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get from near insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears on nimmers.
According to the analysis, the comet is on a so-called hyperbelbahn, which leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced.
The astronomers are lucky: in contrast to 1I / 'Oumuamua 2I / Borisov has already been seen in the beginning, so researchers will have many months to study.' The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will be able to see with medium sized telescopes by April 2020 ', Farnocchia explained.
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor, so a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I / 'Oumuamua, showed a clear weld of the comet in a first survey.
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of interstellar welders offering a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles those of our solar system comets, pointing out that its composition must be similar", reported IAC researcher Julia de León, which suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our complementary de Leóns colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open a new way to research certain processes in other solar systems.
By 2028, the agency wants to place the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position at 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth.
First landing at Beijing ’ s New Mega-Airport Daxing
Just before the 70th anniversary of the People ’ s Republic, the new mega-airport in the south of China ’ s capital is a first passenger machine from China United Airlines, a special honor for captains and crew.
China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project by 2022, and China's recent prestige project is called "Seestern" because of its six-volume structure.
The complex has four runways, which are later to be extended to seven and is equipped with the world ’ s largest automatic air traffic management system.
The Chinese had already said several times during the construction that Berlin could learn from Beijing, and the opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has been postponed time and again.
New surpluses are expected to fly in 2030: four and a half hours from London to Sydney.
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the UK Space Agency dreamed of this - to make it possible for the 2030s to fly in the Overall tempo a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US broadcaster quoted CNN as the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely do," Graham Turnock said the transmitter "We are talking about the 2030s for the commissioning, and the work is very advanced".
A flight from the British capital to the Australian capital to the Australian metropolis is currently about 20 hours.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport", writes Reaction Engines on his homepage.
Resurrection in Washington: Trump wants to see anonymous Tippers in Ukraine ’ s affair
In the Ukraine affair of US President Donald Trump ’ s possible abuse of power, he wants to see potential leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump said to US envoy officials at the United Nations in New York on Thursday.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate Tippgeber, and the event was not public, but several US media spread audio cuts from speech on Friday.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced preparations for an impeachment procedure against Trump on Tuesday, and their accusations are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who makes serious accusations against Trump and his central government.
In his work, Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government officials that the US president uses "the power of his office" to ensure that another country meddles in the US 2020 election.
At the heart of the accusations is a contentious telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that could damage his political rival, Joe Biden, former business by Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine, and alleged efforts to protect his palaces from Ukraine ’ s judiciary. Biden lies in the race for the democratic presidential campaign for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine-Telefonat: Leading government officials would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling.
The identity of the referee is not publicly known, and the New York Times reported that it should be a member of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
On Friday, Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source, and in a series of tweets on the subject, among other things, the president wrote that "whistleblower" has spread information from second hand, which would have turned out to be incorrect, so there may be no tippers or spies at all.
As Trump said in New York about the whistleblower information, but disgusted, the US House Chairman, Nancy Pelosi, responded, lamenting Trump ’ s statement once again undermines the government ’ s integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations have been underway in various committees against Trump and his environment for months, and, given Ukraine ’ s accusations, Democrats are now advancing investigations with new rage to launch a possible impeachment process against Trump.
"The Whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said the chief intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, threw him a false account of things, and called again for the resignation of the Chairman of the Committee.
More than 300 former US officials from the security and foreign-policy area, mostly under democratic but also under Republican presidents, were behind the Democratic investigation launched on Friday for a possible impeachment procedure. If the allegations were to come true, that would be “a ruthless abuse of power ” by Trump.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure, with a majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment procedure, but the decision on a real impeachment would be in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority, so the prospects for such a process ’ s success have been low, and so far no US president has been removed from office ’ s impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Jobs are reduced "creeping".
The VW brand ’ s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe, and this concern is driving the auto company ’ s works council to reduce its annual factory costs by EUR 10 billion by EUR 2 billion by 2023, of which EUR 500 million will be saved this year.
A key to this is staffing costs, and the 'Future Pact' negotiated between companies and works councils in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14 000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020: a job can only be dismantled if it is proven that the related activities are no longer necessary, and employment security by 2029.
As our newspaper has learned from business councils, however, jobs in production that are not in fact disposed of are being cut "creeping" over another path - that is to say, the official course, which often does not re-occupy vacant regular posts.
In these cases, the works council has no means of enforcing re-occupations; in the meantime, there have been a lack of staff who are suspicious of the worries about the gradual blueprint of the vehicle plants, so that there is also a fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world, and only VW said that 'an adjustment of the employment volume will be made as agreed in social terms along the demographic curve'.
The VW brand wants to standardise production worldwide and to centrally manage new projects, thereby reducing costs and also accelerating decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and therefore competitiveness.
In this way, there are already successes: for the first time this year since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year.

The Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced.
As Tostmann has already announced last year, "perspektivisch" in Wolfsburg is expected to roll a million cars from the band, making it possible to bundle golf production at the tribal plant - because the plant in Zwickau is making the golf production site for e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg, but the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have been declining recently, so expectations are now on the Gulf of 8.
With Voodoo forced prostitution: traffickers in human beings are condemned.
Young women from Nigeria have been harassed, forced into the Ruhr area and into prostitution, and six alleged traffickers in human beings must be imprisoned.

The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the injuries and the subsequent distribution of young Nigerians on brothels in the process. "The work made it physically and mentally difficult to create", said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the verdict.
The judgments relate to trade and band-related injuries to foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm Dauerstreit mit dem Lufthansa Group hat die Flugbegleitergewerkschaft Ufo erneut mit Streiks gedroht.
In the event that the company does not return to the negotiating table, on 14 October the trade union will inform the LH Group of the industrial action measures, "Daniel Flohr said on Friday that Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to negotiate with Ufo for months, including the question of whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court, Ufo now sees itself strengthened, and Lufthansa wanted to say that collective agreements have not been terminated, and the Court rejected the application, confirming the decision and examining to appeal against it.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court to review the status of the Ufo as a trade union.
The Ufo had a strong leadership strike in the Spartenunion, during which many members of the Board of Directors and the Advisory Council resigned, including the long-standing trade union leader Nicoley Baublies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eased entry: Saudi Arabia announces a new visa system.
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but that is now to change, and the country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa provisions.

"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the Chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult to access for tourists; Visawerden usually only offers short business trips, religious pilgrimage trips, or visitors to the desert state.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had hit two of Saudi Arabia ’ s most important oil installations: the country ’ s largest oil refinery in Abkaik, and Churais ’ s oil field, causing national oil production to plummet, rising oil price shocks, and it is likely to take several weeks to restore its old level.

Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance.
Some banks are likely to be expensive to the default of the travel provider Thomas Cook according to a press report, with high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans threatening credit.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit, or Credit Suisse would probably have to make write-offs of up to £1.8 billion (around €2 billion) on their books, as the report would have shown by AlixPartners ’ consultancy.
The creditors of bonds would have to borrow write-offs of £900 million to £1 billion, and creditors would have to buy £550 to £825 million, which, in fact, is likely to be at the top of the bandwidths, an expert said.
As a result, creditors ’ losses will be real, after the insolvency proceedings have expired, a person close to this process will not be much hope, for example, the roughly 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in Great Britain, and many of the properties are in bad locations.
Rackete is supposed to have brought alleged murderers to Italy
The Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but even have no secure information about it," said the spokesman of the refugee organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have reconciled the three men in Italy, accused of raping, torturing, and killing people in Libya.

US Federal Government Wars Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government to trust Huawei ’ s Chinese network equipment.
We believe that the risks are too big, "said Pai to the" trading leaflet "with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a 'national security law', which requires every company to comply with the instructions of the security authorities under Chinese jurisdiction.
The law in force also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, "says FCC chief, who makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a 'declaration of confidence' from suppliers.
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reported the "Handelsblatt", invoking its own information.
Pai doubted that this was possible; the 5G technology not only consists of hardware:
The software is very important to keep the devices up to date, which consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, "said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "wherever, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks", the FCC boss continues.
The Chinese corporation Huawei accuses him of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque; the company, which is supposedly owned by the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, "said Pai to the" Handelsblatt ".
Pai was recently in Berlin to promote the US position.
Chemiefabrik in northern France is burning: Schools closed.

French Finance Minister: 'Germany needs to invest now'
French Finance and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, "said Le Maire on Thursday evening when the French budget was presented for next year.
The eurozone economy was weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to deteriorate in order to make the necessary decisions'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Action would have to be taken by those states that have budgetary margins for more investment, including Germany, said Le Maire.
France did not have these margins, the minister added, pointing to his country's high public debt, which is more than 98% of GDP, and the French public debt must be 'stabilized' and 'reduced', said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy, and, in exchange, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to manage its budget deficit..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The French 2020 budget presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
In doing so, the French government is responding, among other things, to protests from the Yellow West Movement, with the new debt coming down to 2.2%, expected 3.1% this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson sofabout Brexit tactics?
The British Prime Minister, Mr Johnson, criticises the 'capitulation law' adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes to the British Prime Minister to avoid a Chaos-Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole, but this option evades Tory politicians.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about whether he wants to impose an unregulated Brexit - despite the most recent law adopted by Parliament, which is precisely what Johnson said to journalists, his government will abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the withdrawal period, should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October, and Johnson criticises this as the 'capitulation law' that opens up negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister, John Major, expressed the suspicion on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law; the prime minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law after leaving the EU; Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October and the best way is to deal with an agreement".
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, stated that he felt the political disputes surrounding Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the EU's desired exit will come about: "We enjoy that, we will win, we will (m. Red.),," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph",.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as chief strategist in Downing Street in the UK, behind the uncompromising policy that has led the Premier into an awkward situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the very big rock photographers, but it does not always have to be the big glamour.
Paul McCartney, who was married from 1969 to Lindas in 1998, was obviously proud and led when he presented the band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Frontfrau Chrissie Hynde.
After the Launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "# ThePolaroidDiaries is a fluid view of the life of an exceptional family from the time before instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film.
At Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always present, and thousands of Polaroids have,,, and.
They are portraits, silence, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 90s.,,,,,,,, and, and,,, and,, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.

It is true that the light, the composition, the image section and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes are already like abstract paintings.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey, despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, wants to continue to import oil and gas from neighbouring countries. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot break off Iran ’ s oil and gas import.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, "said Erdogan in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey has problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies had "withdrawn because of US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey ', particularly on this issue and on many other issues, will continue our relations with Iran', said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its exit from the international nuclear deal with Iran, the US has been pursuing a policy of 'maximum pressure' vis-à-vis the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is pursuing a nuclear program in secret and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran ’ s oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran.
US Government wants to restrict refugee reception
The US government wants to drastically limit the admission of refugees, and the US State Department declared on Thursday that the annual ceiling for a resettlement program should be lowered from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, equivalent to a 40% cut.
The State Department declared that the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who helped the US military in the country, thereby endangering them, as the State Department ’ s statement suggests. Honduras,, Guatemala, and El Salvador,,.,,, and;;,, and,,, and,,,,,, and,,,
In 1980, refugees from UN camps around the world are selected and resettled in the US; the upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget would be the lowest in the history of the program; the current upper limit of 30,000 is a dep; US President Donald Trump ’ s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, was nearly 85,000.
Aid organizations responded to the announced reduction of the ceiling, "which is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband.
Trump is attempting to strictly limit immigration to the US - legally and illegally - according to his own data, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year, separated from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Come near a nick"
US President Donald Trump has accused the whistleblower-case of espionage, and anyone who has ever told the informant that he had misuse of power has sent the appropriate hints, "comes close to a nick," said Trump, according to a record of a private event in New York on Thursday.
So, when he was asked about the person who informed the whistleblowers about controversial events in the White House, Trump replied: "This is close to a nick," Add to Trump: "Do you know what we have done in old times when we were clever, and the spies and betrayal, we used to deal a bit differently than we are doing now.
Observers made the latter remark about a possible allusion to the death penalty, and the Democrats expressed strong criticism of Trump ’ s statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses; it was also an attempt to impede a congressional investigation into possible impeachment proceedings against him, the chairmen of the committees for External, Intelligence, and Representatives.
Whistleblower accuses the president of abusing his office in a now published complaint to seek interference from another country in the US election 2020, including his controversial telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump advised him to initiate investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
As the New York Times reports, whistleblowers are still an analyst of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat: Baby and infants drowned in Aegean
Time and time again, people are trying to come from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea, often falling into small boats, and now seven migrants have died, including five children, in the sinking of a snake boat.
On the island of Chios, seven migrants died in the sinking of a snake boat, including a baby and four other children, the Greek coastguard reported.

Renting suddenly stopped: WeWork lets real estate markets tremble.
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small start-up to the world ’ s most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis; landlords must fear billions of dollars.
WeWork ’ s crisis threatens to disrupt balance in the world ’ s largest real estate markets, with the company ’ s founder, Adam Neumann, deferred the planned stock market and started selling subsidiaries and values like private jet for executives to gain financial space for the next few weeks and months, including the UK Financial Times, WeWork, which stopped the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect, including in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space.
WeWork rents large office areas in the long term and rents them in some small units to members in the short term, allowing individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded lease contracts of up to 15 years, with commitments of more than $40 billion, which could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but also for entire property markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the world ’ s most expensive real estate markets, nearly 300,000 square meters of office space in the last 24 months, WeWorks ’ new contracts meant that demand for offices in New York was greater than the areas newly placed on the market during this period. Without WeWorks expansion, the US metropolis would have risen in that time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider" in London, where WeWork is now in the best position.
In the UK capital, too, the equilibrium in the housing market could be noticeable without further expansion of the aggressive startup, including WeWork ’ s main landlord, in an office house bought last year by the Sparkassen fund provider Deka for nearly EUR 100 million, in the center of the financial metropolis.
WeWork ’ s main objective is to ensure that the company ’ s assets are safe and safe.
Russia Recognized Many North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coastguard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen, with a total of 262 poachers caught illegally in waters, according to the Russian National Intelligence Service FSB of the Interfax Agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea, with border guards being shot down and three injured, and this time there were no injured, the Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on the way to Russian territorial waters, where, according to their own data, the coastguard of Russia is driving patrols for the protection of their marine biological resources.
According to the media, the Russian fishing authority had not issued fishing licences to North Koreans following complaints by local entrepreneurs this year, with thousands of North Korean fishermen already being temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently complained of high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who fished with synthetic nets banned in Russia, which would also bring small creatures out of the sea, and would simply dispose of nets in the sea where they needed 200 years to be crushed, and the ships themselves would not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coastguard were injured in the arrests on the previous week, and a wounded North Koreans later died of his injuries, with Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat on 17 September, and then a second after the fire opened.
US Ban on Ex-President Castro
The United States has imposed entry ban on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, and the US Department of Foreign Affairs has established this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in 'gross human rights violations'.
As chairman of the armed forces, Fidel Castro, the brother of the deceased leader, was also guilty of human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The failure to respect human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela", the American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump, on Wednesday, had issued a visa ban against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months, a series of sanctions against Maduro ’ s government to force him and, president Juan Gu.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allies of Maduros, and the Socialist Caribbean island is receiving oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning again actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world, starting with the postpNew Zealand, Australia, before protests across Europe to North America, where Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major in Canada, in in, in in, in Washington,, in in, in Washington, in, in, in the,, in,,,,,,,,,, in
"Last Friday, more than four million people were in favour of the climate, and this,",, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A good third of all global demonstrators - around 1.4 million - were involved in the protests by Fridays for Future in 575 German cities, according to estimates in 5, in at least 65 cities, including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities like Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
At the age of 15, Thunberg set himself before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 in order to call on her country ’ s politicians to make a greater commitment to climate protection, which, in a short space of time, has led to the Fridays-for-Future movement, with students and students taking part in climate protests, but increasingly scientists and other adults.
Together, they are calling for more ambition in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe, particularly in accordance with the Paris climate agreement, to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared with pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic tribunal with a high-sea racing yacht, where she last attended United Nations climate protests and summits.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
The people of Russia must no longer smoke on the balcony in the future, which is a change in fire protection ', which also applies to smoking', said a spokesman of the emergency ministry at the Tass agency on Thursday in Moscow, saying that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, if you smoke, you will have to pay a fine of 3,000 rubles (EUR 42,46), and if the cigarette is to fire, then the penalty will be higher, according to the Ministry, there will be equally burning candles.
Beat Cybercrime - Detectors lift servers
In the fight against Internet crime, German investigators have for the first time removed a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites on the Mosel as the operator of a data center in a former Nato-Bunker in Traben-Trarbach at the Mosel, via the internationally operating criminals.
On Thursday evening, the Prosecutor's office in Koblenz was arrested, and seven suspects were arrested on a large scale.
Among other things, customers of suspects should have been the operators of the world's second largest drug-market place, Wall Street Market, who had been investigators in the spring, and the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a cyber bunker, according to the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office.
A host of this kind had been wiped out for the first time in Germany.
On access, with the support of special units such as the GSG9, searches took place in Germany and in neighbouring countries.

Climate protests  Who are actually Thunbergs Hintermänner?
In the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warmed up the climate, justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, even in a world of war and smoke, all the more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl is keeping a mirror in front of.
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is putting the masses on the move, bringing young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world.
In addition, Greta Thunberg ’ s rich PR manager has published a book that sells itself widely, thanks to the daughter of the ramp-lit daughter.
This is where the ghosts are now falling: is it morally right to enrich themselves financially with the rescue of the world? Is it still authentic if certain circles of people work together with stock market make-ups during the World Savings Action?
Comet discovered: Interstellarer Guest crosses through our solar system.
A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The assumptions of astronomers have confirmed: a strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time, researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
2I / Borisov: Komet was discovered by amateur astronomers on Crimea.
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Crimea, looking at a self-built telescope sky and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion.
It is now possible for astronomers to gain insight into a foreign solar system from close proximity, and it the of our system, as reported by the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries, according to the International Astronomical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Komet was already sighted before launch - and can be observed for several months.
But before it is so far, astronomers can watch it in depth, because, unlike his predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been seen in his first visit, which means that he can be investigated by the Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness by mid-December and then be able to see medium sized telescopes by April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be able to watch professional telescopes by October 2020.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First insights into Komet 2I / Borisov arose hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter, while the celestial body appears to be similar to our comets - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of welding is similar to that of welding, suggesting that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our complementary de Leóns colleague Javier Licandro.
The observation goes beyond individual knowledge, however, and the fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way of investigating certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids regularly employ researchers, and only recently a giant asteroid rushed past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson horrifies about brother.
Boris Johnson will be lonely; only his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister, with clear words, is the warmongering language of the premiere as "tasteless"; it is not the brother whom she knows.
"Capitalization", "fraud", "contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is continuing to arm - at least verbally - at the time of Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, there was widespread opposition indignation, and there have now been other critics who have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The famous journalist and author said to Sky News, her brother used words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit "were caught, borrowed, divided, disguised, and tortured", which is highly reprehensible, recognizing the version of her brother, Rachel Johnsons, in the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit Party "Change.
She was particularly struck by the fact that her brother, Jo Cox, referred to an EU-friendly subordinate who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi-murdered few days before the 2016 Brexit referendum.
The widow of Cox also sharply criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jos's name is used," he twittered, the best way,,, if,,, and.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory MEP. "I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it is an unsolvable tension," Jo Johnson argued the move.
As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England are critical of the language that "this country is not worthy".
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez are on the Super Bowl.
The NFL sets out a strong signal in its 100-year existence: two women with Latino roots join the next Super Bowl in the mid-term show: "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the semi-time show at the upcoming finale of the US Football League NFL, which the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the US," said Shakira in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which is celebrating its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2, 2010.
"I love that this time the Super Bowl presents two women on stage - and two Latinas," Lopez said, sending an important message to all Americans and the world, promising an explosion of fun and energy for the show.
In the 2000s she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud", and later released songs in Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shakira was known as a star of a telenovela and singer in Colombia.
The announcement of mid-term passengers is eagerly awaited in the US every time, and this year, many people appreciate the choice as a political gesture; after all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump ’ s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest American sporting event and a gigantic advertising spectacle.
Last year, political controversy prevailed, owing to the quarterback of Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up against black police violence from playing the national anthem and, for that reason, US President Donald Trump, among other things, strongly approached some musicians from Kaepernick, including Rihanna and Pink.
An actor and Youtuber places Egypt ’ s ruler: For now, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have had an influence on whether blood is flowing on Egypt's streets, the past week both spent abroad, one of them swept back at Cairo Airport on Friday, and President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly.
Mohamed Ali, the president of the other man who is currently driving events on the streets, has of course remained abroad, where he escapes the access of the security forces that would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egypt ’ s soil. weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only a minority of Egyptians, today he is the dominant voice who dominates political discourse in the country ’ s cafés, living rooms, and teas: with his Youtube-style "Mohamed ’ s secrets", Ali calls his fellow countrymen to stand up against Sisi.
While the people are hungry, the president swear in luxury and are building magnificent new palaces, the army leadership on which Sisi relies his rule accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment, because in his as for 15, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egyptians, as eviclich.
Last week, when Sisis ’ s grip on power demonstrated thousands of people against his rule, and nearly 2000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers, and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for this Friday to become a "million-march", so that so many people would really dare to go on the streets was unlikely, but there were some minor protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in Kina near Luxor.
The city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators last week cracked down banners with the president ’ s portrait, was reported on Friday that massive police presence was being carried out, with security forces erecting checkpoints in the city and on the roads of the city, and several underground stations in the city were closed due to "maintenance work", most roads around Tahrirplatz, the heart of the 2011 revolution, blocked, and on the Rabaa Square, where 2013 supporters of the fallen Muslim Brothers Mursi disappeared until the army took fire and was supposed to prevent another measure from being contested by Sisi, who wanted to hold a party: a meeting here for the future president.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrirplatz," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let us not meet with police officers".
When Provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection is always advertised much more slowly than the provider, there are different testing possibilities.
If you conclude an internet contract, you do not need to rely blindly on the speed specifications of the providers, and customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
After all, the previously promised transmission rates are a contractual component and should therefore be achieved, the consumer centre of Bavaria explains.
If the connection is always much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different test possibilities, so the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the supplier tests are carried out according to supplier specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively", the consumer centre of Bavaria should be considered on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable deadline of 14 days for the supplier to produce the promised performance.
If this does not work after a multiple request, customers may terminate and may also claim damages, but if the success is not achieved, only the Klageweg will be able to help.
First Republicans for Investigation
As the first senior Republican, Vermont Governor declared himself in favour of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that is coming from here, is determined by the facts that will be found," Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday, who wants to know more about the whistleblower-case before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the suspension of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, for Trump has been observing the Biden for years.
Republicans have been reluctant to criticize Trump for the whistleblower-case affair; few have shown unease, and Scott ’ s statements are a first sign of Trump ’ s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules.

But what about the sudden good news?
For example, Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" inale.
After nine stages, the Suits series has now reached the big finals in the USA, with a lot of Happy Ends and as many cameo appearances as the royal couple Prinz Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), which in for many, has been in a charming way.
One thing: Duchess Meghan did not return for a last farewell pit as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes; instead, some rethinks showed the most memorable scenes with today ’ s duc, such as the moments of the failed wedding with Mike or how she after.
But even her real husband, Prince Harry, was temporarily mentioned in the "Suits" section, of course in a wedding scene.

Green politician must answer for embarrassing photo panns.
The leaders of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, during the campaign, were manipulated for this reason the cup?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way bribe on a photo, but now came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally came to an end, and Elizabeth May, the leader of the Canadian Greens, has never been in his hands on the party's website to see them in a photograph with this cup, but the photograph had already been published before and was also disseminated to the media - and the Becher had a schnöder (Papp) Becher, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss is responsible for photo panns.
The National Post accused May of manipulation, and the Fake News Party, to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection", and in the middle of an election campaign to the House of Commons, where it has become increasingly difficult for Trudeau to be corrupt.
The photo was viral in the social media and raised the discussion about Fake News, a user shares a comparison and writes: "The Greens a photograph to".
May showed himself shocked and cheated on her blog that had nothing to do with this action, but in order to underline that, she postulated the original: she, in conversation with citizens, put a cup in her hand, but she did it right, was from bamboo, and she always said that it was only a matter of subjecting the party logo to the picture, and not of concealing something from the photo.
May writes that she is suffering for the staff who have done so, 'I do not want to describe it as stupid, but there was nothing to hide', she says to the Guardians and is also inherited from her overcommitted team: 'If they want to edit an image, then they could not do what with my face, so that I can look younger?'
The German Greens, too, have come into Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or air travel - but their pictures were not capped, so the bosses of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, were on holiday with plastic spoons, as merkur.de * reported.
Influencerin will free upgrade: Lifelong Air Ban at Cathay
Although Jaqueline Ng was promised an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific, when she asked for check-in, she was not allowed to fly on board - and she should never fly again with Cathay.
Spontaneous upgrades for Business Class - many of which dream of many passengers - sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class free of charge.
This case shows, however, how one should not do it: a self-declared influenza cerin has actively asked for a free upgrade to Airline Cathay Pacific.
On the flight, Jaqueline staff denied an upgrade, even though she showed a mail in which Cathay Pacific allegedly promised an upgrade, and the letter by a marketing employee, while Jaqueline accused Jaqueline of of having for.
Jaqueline tried to get an upgrade for long-haul flights on the return flight.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaquelines Ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific.
With her case, the influenza dancer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also asked for the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not enter the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influenza virus committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights, and the airline ’ s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay the new flight.
Yemen ’ s Armistice Report
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest possible time on Friday, with a barrel (159 litres) of the Brent North Sea sites 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4% less than the previous day.
A Wall Street journalist ’ s report on a ceasefire in Yemen was triggered by the slip of the course. Saudi in,, and., and, and,,, and., and,, and,, and,, and,,, and.,
A drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil facilities had stalled five% of world oil production in mid-September, with the Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen claiming the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran; a ceasefire would defuse the region ’ s political tension.
If agreement is actually reached, it is possible to focus on growth and demand, Ole Hansen, head of the Commodity Strategy Department at Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices are continuing its downward movement in recent days, with a barrel of WTI oil cost up to nearly $59 a week ago, Brent nearly $65.
After the attack in mid-September, Bloomberg recently reported that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was moving faster than expected, resulting in a volume of eight million barrels per day and moving again toward the original volume.
Last but not least, there have been press reports on insiders, which report on rapid progress by the Saudi Aramco state-owned oil company in repairing operations, but which point out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock exchange and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the Iranian arrest and the recent release on the way to leave the port, and the crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship continues to be in front of anchor, Mr Erik Hånell told Swedish radio on Friday morning in an SMS.
The US, however, announced that it would move defensive missiles and soldiers to Iran ’ s archetype to Saudi Arabia, with fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom temporarily pushing oil prices up.
Proposals against Trump are getting worse
US President Donald Trump ’ s case of possible abuse of power has fueled suspicion against the White House, with several senior government officials working hard to prevent a contentious telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, declaring an anonymous referee, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, explicitly warned the White House.
North Korea considers Trump and Kim ’ s Third Summit to be doubtful
North Korea has raised doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon lead to a third summit of leaders, Kim Jong-un, and US President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first Singapore summit, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA agency.
The US would have done nothing to implement the summit ’ s decisions last year, as North Korea ’ s foreign ministry adviser also criticized tighter US sanctions and joint US and South Korean military maneuvers, but hope to, and “, ” Trump ’ s decision to bring.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted only to know what a third summit would bring with Kim before he agreed to do so; negotiations on disarmament of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February; in June, both of them met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states, agreeing to revive discussions, but without great success.

Pound under pressure - Interest
British Pound under pressure
Given an early reduction in interest rates, the pound loses value relative to the euro.
Frankfurt speculates on a speedy reduction in interest rates by the Bank of England (BoE) set the pound sterling; the British currency approved by up to 0.4% on Friday to $1.2269.
The result of sales was statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who raised an interest rate cut, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, because uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future, which is surprising, as Saunders was advocating restrictive monetary policy, analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy by the Brexit hickhack, without directly signaling an interest-rate cut, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants his country to leave the EU without any divorce agreement on 31 October.
Moreover, with his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but he could pay for him, says merchandise editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow Analyzer laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today ’ s leader of the Leichtathletic World Federation.
In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
