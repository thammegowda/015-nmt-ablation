DFB-Chef Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you are talking to him about why he or she seems to have found a different, as laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the soccer podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the months of debate about the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regret the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I am also presumed, until a certain time, that would be the case, "said Grindel.
De 29-year-olds had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July, justifying that Grindel did not defend him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and Teammanager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build any pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "you leave a team or alternate, that you talk to his trainer and I find it a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung brannte
At 2.13 p.m. the professional fire was raised to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage pipeline leads directly through the shrine settlement, there was a risk of delay.
The professional fire rifle came out and found the hut in full fire.
The roof had to be removed practically to the geese and burnt in the necessary extent.
According to owner of the burning garden hut, he had hijacked a battery for lunch.
That might be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to fire brigade, the charge was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined, as well as the cause of fire.
However, it should be considerable because the owner had many collectors in his garden hut.

We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the Dieselskandals at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens emphasized that the car manufacturer made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal can never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and intends to continue discussing this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi boss of allowing the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust emissions after acquaintances.

"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Schrecksekunde
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have become more committed to fighting poverty and disease in a joint concert in New York Central Park.
"You can always act wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival in the night to Sunday about 60.0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that is a dream.
Cardi B joined a red outfit with Fransen and goldenem microphone.
I am nervous, I swim, but it is okay, because I am here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations showed themselves on the stage in the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a shrine second when many spectators thought the sound of a declining metallic deflection for shots, fearing and trying to flee.
Shortly thereafter, panic, people ranted each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin reassured the people then from stage.
"Nobody tries to injure anyone", said Martin.
You are all in safety.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available for free every year on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to get a drink on the Internet had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were audiences of jubilee and applause - Buhrufe, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This was discussed with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, Flake had spoken out in the US Senate ’ s Judicial Committee for the Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, thereby upsetting many women.
At least three women have levelled up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects this.
Flake called for a FBI investigation into allegations after two women who have seen their own claims that even sexual assaults have been carried out on the way to the committee meeting in a lift.
"You can also come together at any time in a lift with me", said Flake now at the concert in New York to the audience.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends Rauswurf of the journalist
Steffen Seibert has defended the Rauswurf of a journalist at the press conference by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellor office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had pulled a T-shirt with the Turkish and German label "Freedom for Journalists" and went into the first row.
The T-shirt, not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption to the press conference.
The action of the journalist has resulted in a strong unrest, which is unacceptable.
He therefore led people to bring the man out.
He said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely independently of whether this is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying or supporting or membership in banned parties or of the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is blaming the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threatened several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are not sure of the Turkish authorities either: only in early September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had taken care of.
They were free and were able to return to Germany, but they still run trials against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well known to him his fans usually: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for feuchtfröhliche Gespräche an der Theke der Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderators in Ina Müller meet with their guests on manches beer, some wine or even more processual drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few promis drink also for the compulsory singing templates courage.
On Friday another episode of the popular Talkshow was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Männerherzen", "Terror - Your judgment" or "Der geilste Tag".
The Munich-based excursion to the high north did not get good.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumbled, the eyes only two small slits.
The Bett-Selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful cater.
On his fans he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now won: "Rule one: goes NIE to Inas night.
Usually two: never drink the black sau.
And Spritz.
And the round of Eierlikör, the Ina around half melts, also let away.
Alcohol consumption is truly written to the 43-year-old.
His fans sent a few tips to fight the offspring.
They were abundant of instantees, fish crumbs, or - presumably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply amuse themselves about the sight of the usually attractive Kinostars.
As Ina Müller has survived the next suction stream, it has not yet been known.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the Theke but already since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried...
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with Vandalism and Unrat.
The entry into the 36 km long railway route in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are scarcely distinguishing.
Scherben, Zigarettenkippen, Müll und Unrat, demolierte Mülleimer und mittlerweile demontierte Hinweisschilder - so präsentiert sich seit Längerem der Einstieg mit Sitzgruppe zum Radweg auf dem Haaße-Hügel in Treysa.
For the forgiveness project Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland a more than glowing sight.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC community of Schwalmstadt, but also others, longer, so the Radverkehrsbeauftragte of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the Radstadt Council.
A solution has not yet been found.
The proposals range from the seating group to regular discharging of waste containers and cleaning of land on the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible other activities", says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reported that the topic was also included in the local advisory board.
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and residents - the Sitzgruppe is a regular meeting point for celebrations at weekends.
It is not only often said that the gelagen is also destroyed: posts from the earth, rubbish bins demolished, signs of the cooked, seating furniture are damaged.
Volunteers have already been admitted more frequently, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drops on the hot stone.
You will be pleased to see that the Rastplatz at Radweg in Treysa is a meeting place for saunas.
"Entlang des gesamten Radweges liegt hier am Haaße-Hügel eindeutig der Schwerpunkt", bestätigt der Radverkehrsbeauftragte, der sich nun auch um die neue Radstätte in Ziegenhain sorgt, die heute eröffnet wird.
"She relies on the same fate, it is right".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly the threshold is much higher to interfere with common good.
But that would presuppose that a police strike is close to time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the Haaße-Hügels.
It must be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the radar channel, you can be very satisfied.
The tourist marketing is still eligible.
Our cycle path is very high quality compared to other ADFC members in Germany.
As a highly critical hazard, ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no biegespur on the hill of Haaße-Hill.,,,.
It can happen that cyclists are waiting in the middle of the road between both sides of the road ", explains them.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Musik-Contest in the cultural station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake.
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and co-existence.
"D ein Lied für Hiltrup" darzubieten, lautet der Appell der Stadtteiloffensive Hiltrup, im "Musikcontest für große und kleine, junge und erfahrene Musiker".
A contest "with an eye compelling in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family co-existence with coffee and cakes of the Ehrenamtlichen des Kulturbahnhofs.
Seven formations joined, from the Ein-Mann-Band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long life in Hiltrup of the Albachtener, the novels of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, declared District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What were the textures connected with?
Hiltruper Lake and the market alley were often mentioned in places.
Rolf Ihmig arbitrated the Allee in his striking song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Alvin Jasic has always been involved in the experience of co-existence in these places, especially.
Karl Franke revived the short cuts with short interviews with interpreters or hints about their work.
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
From Stefan Schemmelmann ’ s sound technician, Franke knew that the younger in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed his allerhand on Youtube.
"It's not about winning", Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favorites of the jury there was still something special - so that others can listen to their songs.
A whole CD can be Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his help drummer, the Franke especially with his musicality impressed, and the Lummerland-Rudel: "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, children joined the final once again - and even without electronic support "right", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, with regard to Hiltrup, intimacy of melody and recognition.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian school for music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahler from the economic association and Jan Kaven, chairman of the city ’ s offensive.
The city ’ s offensive was the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She valued the event as a full success.
All are very satisfied ", and" the atmosphere was good "soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game is played.
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, it contains four cards with keywords that you can remove - the old trick with the red slide - when you put it in.
This ensures that the other side can not read anything from the error.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Window..,,.
3.
4. Feast ".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted.
Because errats are not meant to be the terms, but codes.
Abalternately a player per team is the encryption team.
He gets a code card that may be "3.4.2".
It is recommended that "decrypto" should not hide the terms behind the secret films, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe the terms "cube", "feast" and "windows" in this order, so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the enemy team as not as much as possible, because that wins the game if it succeeds twice to crack the code.
The encryptor thus reads and reads loud: "Werfen" for the cube, "Lose" as opposed to feast; here would of course be something like "Party" and "Prague" because it fits in the school and knows the windows there.
So it goes for round, team for team.
You do not know the terms of the item - but this can be better summed up with any hint that the encryption there is.
Maybe mysterious, but not turned off, the outrages should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The Kryptischste an "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study at length for a long time, until they can finally play.
The explanatory video under decrypto.info in the web makes it easier.
But whoever has declined will be fascinated by how much sense is in this seeming game.
However, "Decrypto" is not as coherent as its predecessors and Genre Primus "Codenames", which is also an agent on a game less words, but much better to play in small groups.
And whoever is talking about rats and not winning points can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: man shows police hitlergruss and harassed guests in the pub.
A 48-year-old man employed police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday twice.
It was only in the upper town of a former police station that hit the Hitler mine, later he also fell in the upper town in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholised by the police, Platzverwei had to spend the night in police inspection Kulmbach in prison.
In a sober state, it must also be held liable for the use of identifiers of unconstitutional organisations.
Works work Pressig was home to Schublok's blocs.
The railroad business in Pressig was decades the hub in Frankenwald.
1991 ended a piece of railway history.
"When buffers are squeezed, one hears it all in Pressig," Georg Dinkel remembers the history of the place and the railway station archived.
That did not inspire anyone.
Because quieted brakes and scattered the wagons.
That was the very railway.
Statements that are sensual for Dinkels ’ homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was so marked by the railways.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-Bergstrecke to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 metres of altitude, has its crossroads in Steinbach on the forest.
In order to cope with this, once needed train and train blocs, which had their homeland in Pressig.
In 1901 the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station with 21 locomotives, apprenticeships, chassis and railway mastery.
"Heart was the hub which, after a reconstruction in 1899, had a diameter of 18 meters", Norbert Heidrich tells from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of career career pioneer.
From the railway station (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, the train was also operated for the side sections Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported by a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the route 1939 already minimized the need for trains and drawers.
From 1977 onwards, they were used only for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 guards were placed in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant, in 1991, were broken off.
Heidrich: 'It is regrettable that we did not envisage better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport'.
In 1989, the railway director Nuremberg celebrated the 50th anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" a pompöses Bahnhofsfest in Pressig.
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Little later.
On June 1, 1991 the last 30 men were deducted, the Rangier station Pressig was history.
"The curiosity and inhibitors learned the most difficult work in train traffic", reminds thighs.
Everybody would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station of Pressing Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and has many more historical and current images here in the infrankenPlus article.

50 years MGV 68 albums: Singers celebrate 50th birthday festively.
1968 - That was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachts also made their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find out that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should no longer be a Sangesleben in the district.
It has now become the legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they raise the MGV 68 albums from the baptism.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband.
On the "Traumschiff" Heide Keller became the star.
Now she openly talks about the fact that the series could have had a co-blame on her husband, Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she always went on board.
The series that she made to the Star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"This could also have been a reason.
For I was wondering with this work, travelled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues took me on an equal footing, "told Keller in conversation with the" picture on Sunday ".
For starters, she has always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but this has changed with the "Traumschiff".
For now, the journalists were only calling at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well".
She considers it possible that her husband could have been quite envious, but "like many men, Hans also shy about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he wanted to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means good German: I understood myself "as she explains.
She always felt that "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which I never was in truth, even though I sometimes appeared frech and courageous.
I wanted our love to be always ".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller still said yes, "although I was afraid that it could also go a second time."
On the day before the funeral I sat in the Garderobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage of Borsody also failed.
Why never dressed with men?
Because I wanted too much.
At that time, the cellar was presented as "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I went too naive to love. '
The night falter, which in the NZ-Ressort Zurich has regularly explored the nightlife of the city, this time dared the ZFF-opening party.
Our Falter is not a motte, but a little shy.
And the grelle Glanz, in which a green carpet is baptized on the sixth pitch, blends it over fee.
But it is a film festival, as want to be more or less celebrities in the spotlight.
In this late thunderday evening, torkelt on the square to make it easy for you to relax in the Aquaclean-WC oasis.
In this way, the toilet facilities sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the need for a new pavilion is a lot of trouble to hide a luxurious ambience.
In this evening, however, the mistress' s in the oasis for any reason leads to heaven.
In other words, here, the other side of the street is the "Green Book", which was opened in the cinema next door to the opening film, just like every year the festival begins with a party at the three-storey shopping house.
Dessen name fits perfectly with this film: from all over the globe, as you know, the works shown are made.
What do you have to do with an article about this festival is not to be imagined to fall into the veil advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The wrinkle binds a bench to the fodder that has put him in a good fence, and two bulky door steal winks actually generate him in the first place.
Drinks are pushing the joints, they dance well after midnight to live music or let themselves be driven by DJ rhythms that they rip each other, and rinse with Cüpli exquisite hardness.
In the delicacy shop in the souterrain waiting for slurry minors, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain leaps.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves are fully exclusive products for the occasion have not been removed.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without any losses.
We must love that country!
The Falter studies the shield in the roller staircase: "wear a long dress, please be careful on the roller staircase".
If the two separate statements have been made, he will be squandered in the Dresscode.
But it is rather a conditioner construction, and certainly has saved lives.
In the budget division on the upper floor, the poultry poultry prepared a cocktail called "Golden Eye" with Espresso, fitting to the festival award.
The price for the best drink is this mix with which a capsule manufacturer is presented, not necessarily.
And George Clooney, who has been obsessed with this brand for years, is not here either.
However, since there is a temporary face between local alprominence, Kassentisch and kitchen articles, which is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
The main characters should not be far away.
And really: Just walk Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost like a chorus retroactively, through the crowd.
It is not adapted, it does not give way, it is recommended at most.
It is precisely for this reluctance, as a connotation, that international stars love this film festival.

Four minutes before the Sirene was the lead still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Griffing the impartial.
Bieletzki usually forbids to blame others.
But: The 120-Sekunden-time penalty, the Steffen Mühlhoff casted, "was a joke".
LIT had laughed well and met for the end four times - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys have fought great, at the back of seven men, and have repeatedly thrown the empty gateway again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only they can buy for the compliments little.
"Now a damned victory", the restless Bieletzki used.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Report from the Allbright-Stiftung: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards.
This was just 8% of the boards of the Stichtag 1 September, as the report says, "The power of monoculture", which is officially presented to this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and the German Press Agency.
"Companies will have to change, otherwise international competitors will have to pass them," said Stiftungs-Geschäftsführerin Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden are purely male leaders - with few exceptions - no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative and forward-looking compared.
It is another corporate culture.
The slight increase in the share of women among German stock exchanges is also due solely to positive impulses for the company's index of medium values (MDax).
It is true that only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8%.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the past few years - stagnated the proportion of women.
Finally, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will be recruited again in the coming year - in their own interest", said anchors.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that no commitment to increase the proportion of "zero percent" so far has not been made to self-commitment.
Another picture arises from the supervisory boards: on 1 September, women ’ s share was 30.5% - 45 women were more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Recruitment is just as much a percentage of women per year as it would be in 2023 from 40 percent," says the report.

Manchester United is losing once again, for Mourinho we are tired of it.
After the palm of the league, Manchester United is now losing the Premier League in the 7th round.
West Ham United is subject to manU 1: 3. The way the defeat should be.
Sinnbildlich war die Szene in der 74. Minute, in der wiedergenesene Marko Arnautovic für West Ham das 3: 1 schoss; nur drei Minuten nachdem Marcus Rashford die Red Devils vermeintlich zurück ins Spiel geführt hatte.
As they were suspected by Mark Nobel of an offside, all defenders of Manchester remained, and Arnautovic left all the time of the world to join the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative climax of a previously unsatisfactory performance over long distances.
This is not the case at the moment with Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City.
Pep Guardiola ’ s great competitor came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an approximate 2: 0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke for the home team for the first time the defensive seal of the Aussenseiters.
Sergio Agüero cared for a good hour and a double pass with the previous Torguard for ensuring the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1: 2-defeat in Ligacup fought Xherdan Shaqiri with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1: 1 against Chelsea.
Like the Cup-Out, the Belgier Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-olds meeting in the 25th minute remained in the final phase of the only match.
Shaqiri, who arrived in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah in the field, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Besser made it Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After starting the Reds with an impeccable record in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First, the London team of Jürgen Klopp eliminated in the Cup, through the Remis in the league, the Blues Liverpool now plunged into the top of the table.
As City celebrated the two London City clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2: 0-Siege.
The fans of the Gunners, with whom Granit Xhaka played, had to deal with the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire, but until the 81st minute, to a successful announcement.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford-Defender Craig Cathcart launched a Hereingabe of Alex Iwobi unhappy into his own gate, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made his third seasonal decision.
Arsenal passed through the fifth victory in succession of Watford and is located just behind the big rivals Tottenham on fifth place, leaving a strong impression on climbers Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The clouds remained unchanged at 2: 0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time and occupy 8th place.
VW ’ s core brand is missing: Parisian automobile salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Parisian Automobile Salon takes place every two years in the change with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue, but the diesel scandal and the ring around driving bans and upgrades are unlikely to make the German car companies redundant at the Paris branch.
At the 2018 automotive salon, they show their new products from all over the world together with the competition from the French capital.
The same does not actually play a major role in this.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the Berlin Government by then, are likely to be an important subject, at least behind the shining scenes of the knives.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models among others: the e-tron of the Ingolstadt should come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgarter 2019.
Officially, both were already presented.
The iNext from BMW will start only 2021.
The new 3er is at the heart of Paris.
All in all, from 4 to 14 October, more than 250 exhibitors are represented in this year.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists and numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in the change with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors came well.
In the severe earthquake and the following tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken on Friday by two earthquakes.
The first earthquake had the strength 5.9, the second strength 7.4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, there was enormous damage.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered together on the beach.
It is feared that victims will still pay a significant amount.
The figures date from only Palu.
However, there are also numerous other municipalities - along Sulawesis west coast.
About 150 Bikers celebrate Gottesdienst in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final gottese service for the motorcyclists in the Church of Peace in Eveking on Sunday with a helpteam.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final gottese service for the biker was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and therefore responsible for the most sought-after concerns of the PS-strong two-wheel driver.
Between April and September, a month of traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the house of Nordhel.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
On Sunday around 150 bikers came together to celebrate a different service than ordinary worship.
Already from 10 o'clock, the Boliden was ripped up before the entrance portal of the church.
First of all, the biker boots on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a defy curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders were also a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
Preached during the Biker service Pfarrer Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill was responsible for the musical understatement.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill proposes rather poetisch-quiet tones to", so parish Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday. and.
Feel at home: After the apple, the milk comes from the milk.
And even during the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
They pledged their hungry guests with freshly prepared apple cakes.
Great interest was also expressed by Georg Hartmann Niemerg.
He had demonstrated his apple press in the luggage and demonstrated his astonishing spectators step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann-Niemerg leave the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle force the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how a tasty drink should be made.
But they were able to look at this late Friday afternoon.
In forms packed and surrounded by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked a little like hardening well looking apple pieces layer for layer layer layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran after and into a large vessel.
But the farmer had already finished filling specialties.
He opened his "treasure chest" and presented the older visitors the latest feathers.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly large.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also built up the Hüpfburg for themselves.
Also active members of the Cameroon family of former soldiers engaged in the festival and invited some stations to short games.
In the coming year, the home club will also offer an action day.
But, as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out, the home house will not be in the heart of the local savings money.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the subject: after all, it will be around milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season bust: "Treat situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coaches André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointing profits from Hanover 96 and spoke to them courage.
There was a lot of positive things before at 1: 4 (0: 2) of the table last time at Eintracht Frankfurt, however, did not see.
"It's a difficult situation, but you have to fight as a team," said 96-soccer professional Pirmin Schwegler and shot after: "That is obviously disappointing, because you always take a lot before".
The further relentless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met, has two meters down, and are a candidate for departure in their current constitution.
On the other hand, the first Saison-Heimsieg was celebrated by the surprise Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) reached the 46,300 spectators the goals for the DFB-Cup winner who, after the successful rehearsal for the European League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table, proposed whether.
Croatia ’ s vice-world champion Rebic was almost involved in any dangerous revelation of Hessen ’ s witch and of Hanover ’ s defense.
After the World Championships, the storms were long hit with his pace and assertion, why he is so valuable for the tracht.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed from the FC Liverpool, was the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurt, which began to swear.
A scalp of Lucas Torró (17) was first brought in danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller became richer in his position at the last moment of the 96-defense around the Brazilians Felipe, who fell short of Kevin Wimmer (back), stopped.
The leaders of the Hausherren almost inevitably fell and deserved.
Filip Kostic hob the ball after a defensive corner in the penal room, Haller extended his head to the gate where Ndicka needed only the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga reffer for the French two-league AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt even before the break.
This time, Haller adapted to his Sturmpartner Rebic, who went through the skinned and 96-Torwart Michael Esser had no chance.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach reacted to the weak vision of his elf and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony now played a bit more courageous forward, but the ideas remained short before the end, when the suitcase was still successful.
Hessen was far more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then put right on De Guzmán, who had to push the ball to the empty gate.
The rest was still running for the Frankfurter gegen überforderte Gäste nur noch Schaulaufen, auch Jovic traf eine Minute vor dem Ende noch.
The Morlaixplatz will become the Partymeile le
In spite of cool temperatures, good mood prevailed at the Oktoberfest in downtown.

Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Heilig-Kreuz-Fest.
The violinist Katholiken celebrates the Holy Cross on 14 September or on Sunday afterwards.
The religious service takes place in the city church, and then a procession to the Holy Cross with the closing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the Sheikh Christ, who comes from the 30-year war, and is supposed to have fired on the legend of a Swedish soldier.
From the thrust floss then blood.
This developed into a great pilgrimage to the Sheikh Christ, which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until today, only the Altarraum stands, the missing Langhaus is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, Pfarrer Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, of the comfort and of life.
The service of God was badly visited despite the importance of the Scourge Parish.
After the divine service, the procession took place at the Holy Cross Church and ended with the final blessing of the church part of the Cross.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been invited to the secular part of the festivities in the Catholic parish.
The choir members sent the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and the weather adapted to the farmer's oak.
In the afternoon, the parish church still held guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors about the damage to facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction, which will take up to next year.
After the rumour has already been made, the damage could be more precise and the individual tenders could be prepared more specifically.
It is true that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage that has already been done a few years ago is greater, but it has also been noted, which was only possible by means of an injection.
The Sockelverputzarbeiten are completed, before the winter is to be started with the natural stone and one hopes to finish the half of this work this year.
Einweihung: Neues Wohnheim in der Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller lifestyle aid opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" is handed over to his provision - there were all those present at the inauguration ceremony.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who already live in the residential home of Donau-Iller have been dependent on the special architecture of the new building for some time.
Wide corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas has architect Rudolf Bader taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former US Army officer building was placed on the test bench for the residents of Handycap: "The house had not come in the years and did not have more time in the equipment," explained Bader retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators crashed around the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel at ease, so the architect.
Living aid Donau-Iller opens new residential home.
About EUR 4.6 million invested in new construction.
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
The construction works have remained within the planned framework, according to the architect Bader, as well as financially.
He also thanked the Managing Director of Life Aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time humid construction has not always been easy.
However, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allow the inhabitants to experience the freedom, even without moving outside help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile".
In doing so, the residences and functionality were combined well, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The plot in this situation is a real fortune because it is no longer to acquire it in today's situation".
Altogether, the new residential home in Münsterblickstraße offers almost 1500 square meters space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three living groups.
Stolz ist Lebenshilfe-Geschäftsführer Heinz auf die elf Vollzeitkräfte, die allesamt nach Tarif angestellt seien.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the day of unity, the deputy SPD chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to be found with the disadvantages of East Germany.
There are differences that are painful after almost 30 years of unity.
With these differences, we must not be satisfied, "said Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the" Tagesspiegel am Sonntag ".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East German workers worked longer than the people of West Germany, but 15% less pay.
"I can explain this almost 30 years after the German unity nobody", said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this putty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan-Jagdhund is supposed to smooth between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax the relations with Seoul, Pjöngjang made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungsan-Jagdhunde.
As Moons Bureau announced on Sunday, the two about one year old dogs reached their recipients on Thursday.
They therefore passively conquered the border location Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the animals' 'reconciliation.
The dogs with the thick white coat, spitting ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The Friendship had announced at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korea ’ s leader Kim Jong Un in Pjöngjang in mid-September.,,, and.,,.,,,,,,
At the same time, both countries agreed to join together in international sporting competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to apply for the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the test plant Tongchang Ri for missile drives.
Austrian History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year's commemoration, numerous new books have appeared, which usually answer this question in retrospect to the past hundred years.
In other words, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive, will appear in the splendid picture book "Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, New Chance for the Government
Back to the work of the state - that is the unofficial motto for the grand coalition that is starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and its ministers from CDU, SPD and also from CSU last but not least the "return to the subject" mantraartig beschworen.
This may be the case with some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other people working in that country, who are justified in asking what is actually the difference between work and work, but 's drum.
If the federal government is now, once again, to dedicate itself to its task - to governance - it should not now be held with concepts of it.
Whether or not the Union and the SPD, following the provocations and bubbles of recent weeks, will actually be able to bring something together, may well prove to be the case on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties to the coalition committee come together.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the disputes.
First of all, however, there are conflict-ridden subjects on the agenda with the diesel equipment and the specialist labour law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange-rate premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the duty of technical retrofitting of older diesel.
During the Diesel Crisis, a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend, and SPD is still far apart in the planned specialist immigration law.
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers working or training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the 'change of track' from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will again be controversy among coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equals and equals has joined forces to coexist, but three partners with very different social models and priorities.
Discussion is good.
Without quarrel, a society that is so diverse, sometimes contradictory, does not advance.
However, in order to be constructive, there must be no dispute again for partisan reasons on the question of being or not being built up.
It is still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD are supposed to be striving - but always the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful?
With this key issue, both diesel and spurchange issues can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, the People's Party must now fight..
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister of Visier
Does the Minister of Labour, of course, violate the applicable law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to look more closely at this.
"Really day and night" their legalists worked on social security reform, reported a surplus social minister during the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) meets with reference - it now brings the matter to Parliament via question.
They assume that the ministry only expressed their enthusiasm for the deployment of their teams and did not want to proclaim infringements of the service law before the cameras running.
Nevertheless, they now have questions to be able to talk about Har ­ tinger from any suspicion.
Police are looking for women's light on a street.
Marxgreen - Long wanted the police not to comment on it.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is buried.
The route is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
Previously, the investigators had previously used an archaeology and used it.
The Hund trained, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide in the multi-males, was finally able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Department of Monument Protection in the area of said road work, a ground anomaly was discovered.
Since more than one year, prosecutors and criminals have been working on the court for the misuse of crime.
Marxgrün has repeatedly been locked in a cycle path and investigated with sonars because the investigators suspect that this could have been squandered in the course of the rebuilding of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary anniversary
On Monday, the controversial referendum on independence in Catalonia is the first time.
But there are already crashes.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, it came to the centre of Barcelona to clash between separatists and the police.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the pro-independence activists, including paint powders, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their counterparts, who were illegally admitted last year in the referendum in the local elections.
In trying to prevent citizens from voting, it was also the result of violence at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central-state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the approximately 6000 separatists would then have tried to break the police chain, and the officials, among other things, use paint bags and eggs.
Six people have been arrested, 24 others have been slightly injured, and there has been an appeal to the authorities.
On Monday, for the first time, the independence referendum will take place.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid, Catalonia, in autumn 2017, had been forced to rule.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont flew to exile to Belgium.
Other politicians, too, turned abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, continue to be in U-.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
Following the inauguration of the new Catalan Government in May, forced government was brought to an end.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the right to self-determination of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Versammelte Ratlosigkeit: FC Gütersloh und RW Ahlen trennen sich torlos los
Red White Ahlen will continue on the spot.
At FC Gütersloh, too, there was only one thing: 0: 0 unresolved.
The final light and the third final puppets they gathered before 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as a collectible dewaldstadion.
The first half was overlooked by the entertainment factor.
If you would prefer to get a beer or a bratwurst, you could do so.
There was no danger of missing a torchance because there was practically no.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) Torschuss of the whole lot called Güterslohs Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility had the Ahlener, as Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes with a shot of the penal area from a paradox.
The hosts were even harmless.
Their most effective action consisted of an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged for injury, for him came to Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48-minute target Sebastian Mützel came out of 18 meters above the housing and after an hour the freight sloher appeared for the first time.
After a balloon conquest of Matthäus Wieckowicz it went fix.
The swift presentation of Konter about Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62nd) with a glass shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also laid a head ball from Wieckowicz (66th) to a corner ball of the ex-Ahleners Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interimstrainer Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did not work.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahlener did not materialize.
Only in the 91st minute had Cihan Yilmaz the last chance, but also the brought nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to remove the positive: "It pleases me that we played zero," but unfortunately the zero was also at the front.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against wood wrapping and even though our opponent had no desire to play here," said RW Ahlens Interimstrainer.
Apparently, "everything went so a bit" against a team, "which only wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not feel that we could get a counter-war ', so Daut.
But he had no sense of being a spectator, but his team could shoot a gateway.
That was too meagre to the idea.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately, there are enough chalk mers.
The Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler of the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are destined.
The honorary official assurance: "These donations remain in the Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky showed bright blue, but the place was still empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
Because: "Here it is so nice to socialise, so we are here today," said a visitor.
The organiser of the Festes Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper priest Humor.
For the spouse Brockmann, which should actually be woven against food, sprangen short-term Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there is enough chalk.
And the "replacement" let it not take to entertain more and more visitors by musically.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung later.
"Just great", joyous Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to sign the opening date of this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many active players with their booths, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be something like a cube not giving", he thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those who were in use at the stands and also completed the other ones in September and the Clean up action.
Our garden town has a colourful touch - what is at stake here.
Then the Maikranz was brought down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and the winter quartier.
Many booths have been worked for the sake of the.,,,,,.
From sweet to heart everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has been living in Reckenfeld for a year, was creative in his decorative sacred.
Furniwork, Bierdeckel with Reckenfelder Motiven and a lot more had to offer in the offer.
A speciality offered three reckenfelder Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter still has a speciality.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Because the little Elsa had to access again and again, so well covered the cake.
The sociability is that the visitors then spend a long time in the evening, even without a stage program that did not exist at the autumn festival.
Schmierereien mit lokalpolitischer Botschaft: No successful advertising for Skateanlage
In Lengerich, unknown people have scarcely promoted the construction of a skateplant.
In several places there are corresponding lubricants, Jürgen Kohne says of the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been accused of being insulting.
In large letters on signs, among other things, on the Gempt-Halle and on the Old Town Hall the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!".
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the trade fair on 19 September, a correspondingly correspondingly moved to the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro was discovered.
Since the short message at the time appears to have been 'only' left with Edding, it can be removed without any problems.
"A few days later, this was the case again, as this time sprayed", so Rottmann.
It assumes that the appropriate advertising shield must be replaced.
A special note is given precisely this case by the fact that several large companies are also called from Lengerich. are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If the Skateanlage is to be built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
Promises already exist, explained Jörg Hesselmann from the urban field of education, sport and culture without name.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that stand on the coated table.
For years local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateng.
After the old LWL clinic had been dismantled, after some time the search started after an alternative location.
The Council finally advocated a majority in favour of fire-fighters.
This effort has not been put in place - too many factors seem to be opposed to the construction of this site.
At the end of June a U-turn followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now unanimously voted for the Areal of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word was then the City Council.
It is based on a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built by 2019.
Making Air Safety Eng Worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer, German air traffic controllers do not see signs of improvement next year.
"In this year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said the chief of the trade union of air traffic control, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the many delays and accidents that have long been known for the lack of personnel in European air navigation, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots lasts four to five years," said the trade unionists.
Europe is the market for finished pilots.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace there were about 100 people missing.
Maas once again criticized the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic City, representatives of the Bundes, the countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports arrive on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compulsion and overtime, that will not go without us," the head of the GdF, who has many members in Germany's own German air traffic control.
Maas once again blamed the Commission for pilotage misery.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost and personnel savings in national air navigation systems are now fully integrated into the operational business.
Maas appealed to German Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that do not make air safer.
At the moment, the EU ’ s targets would be adjusted to 2024, and there is a fear of further tightening.

Trump is telling Kim: "And then we fell in love with us"
The fact that the US President of North Korea ’ s leaders, despite Kim ’ s nuclear crisis, is not a mystery.
Now Trump has made his colleague a veritable declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kims "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, US President married to a new flame.
The tragedy: it is a long-distance relationship.
In all the public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love on Saturday to North Korean rulers Kim Jong Un.
Prior to joining the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tenacious words for half the old emperor dynasty from Pjöngjang, though the struggle for North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament proves to be quite tough.
"I was tough, he also, and between us it went and her," Trump reported.
And then we left.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the talks with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote beautiful letters to me, it was great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the nuclear-missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far paid little more than lip service.
That the affection for the “Rocket Man ” – so Trump ’ s nickname for Kim – did not seem to be all your audacious to the US president.
In any case, he accepted the expected criticism of his appearance in a large sports hall of the city wheeling straight away: "Donald Trump says she fell in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That is so unpretentious.
He took care of this, but very little, declared Trump and set his finger at the crowd: "I have always told you it is so easy to be dial".
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there in this prall filled arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.

Refugees, thanks to video from Libyan jail, rescued
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya through a mobile phone video, thereby enabling their rescue.
The group had filmed the inclusion in its cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under threat of life and spread online.
"You refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The inclusion was sent to the site "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
After all, refugees were fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in the attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he came to his own statement in danger of life.
One of his fellow fighters had been beaten by the guards almost to death, Onyeka said.
Generally speaking, the conditions of liability have been disastrous: 'You swallow us all with pipes and sticks'.
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the Latrine.
IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Approximately 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homeland in this year ’ s IOM-Sprecher in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of Nigerians now, with a view to the poor detention conditions in Libya, is not exceptional.
From a help phone video he has not heard so far.
International organisations are critical of the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps since long ago as inhumane.
The North African state, which is dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the path of Africa to Europe.

Let the Rule of Law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) spoke to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan according to his own rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
In particular, waves of arrests, press and religious freedom.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that, if relations are to be normalised in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important precondition for this to.., and.
Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He formulated the expectation that freedom of expression will be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The meeting of Laschet and Erdogan was in the short term a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense ’ s willingness to fly to Cologne airport.
Originally it had to take place at Wahn Castle - but the castle owner rejected Erdogan ’ s political conviction.
Erdogan continued to travel to Cologne to discuss the opening of the Ditib-Mosque.
Laschet had made a joint appearance in the construction work.
He said: 'Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country'.
And we are also the contact person - and not the Turkish President.
Confidence in the United States: North Korea is calling for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the successes in negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is the sober one.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for an object to Washington.
North Korea ’ s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the US administration of continuing sanctions in the UN general debate to block negotiations on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
"The recent deadlock is therefore that the US is building forced measures that are lethal for confidence building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, there is no way that we, as the first self-disarmed", led the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that punitive measures could force North Korea to 'knees' is a dream of people who do not know us'.
To build trust, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear plant, hob Ri.
On the US side, however, there has been no 'appropriate response', the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, last year the UN Security Council alone adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, have been calling for strict compliance with the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met Kim Jong Un for the first time in North Korea.
After the first Singapore summit, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is to return to talks about ending the North Korean nuclear weapons program after Pyongyang.

The funding was funded by donations from the community, for which young people wanted to thank the food.
In doing so, the launch with the new facility was not as easy as Henriette Westbuer, who reminds the head of the HoT.
We had already filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were prepared for the great day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power outlet had put the huge two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from scratch: although we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, the children and young people wanted to create it alone", so Westbuer.
And so all packed with them.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Besser can also not use chefs", lobbyed a visitor in impressed while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cake.

Sartor is still active for the vinegar table - "six days a week, as nothing changes", so Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized in the "World on Sunday" again criticized colleagues from other tablets.

These are all the social fuzzi that criticised me at the time.

Pleite at Hertha: From reality, Bavaria is catching up against Ajax.
The predikat is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not like the FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim fazit for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small power models under the new Coach Niko Kovac should not in any way increase the Munich to a greater low.
"A week ago we had the impression that we are unbearable.
Now we have got a bit of a reality, "said Thomas Müller, after the deserved 0: 2-defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League-Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this is right and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year, no separate gate has been shot, as at the same time the pre-season two compulsory matches in series without victory, the table leadership in the football league did not lose Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, yet the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at the 1: 1 with its intensive Mann-opposite mann-tactics and the Berliner through their playful Nadelstiche over the outside have delivered three days equal to two blueprints, such as the last overpowering Bavaria yet to be cracked.
"The FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again", stressed Kovac..
Otherwise, he went with his losers in his birthplace, but surprisingly sanft, and postponed his first defeat as Munich Coach only to the once again flawed handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would be a positive step ahead of the country break the first interim fazit of his term of office - otherwise the tone may be more severe.
Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second premiere performance of this season after 2: 0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second runner game against Ajax, which had also been forced to launch AEK Athens with 3: 0.
"Now's us in two games we are caught, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team papers Manuel Neuer.
Like after the lost cup finals against Eintracht Frankfurt, Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly at the same place.
The legal defender played a role in the role of Mahner.,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I do not think that everything is bad, we have to work out it again, because we do not make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes", stressed the 23-year-old shortly before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous game season, Bavaria even had five counters behind Dortmund, which now took the lead again with one point.
And so Kimmich valued with an eye compelling at least positive that the public debate has now ended in the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria.
"Yes, this is good," said the national player.
For the league it is already good.
DFB-Boss in Schusslinie: Özil-Causa: Scharfe Attacke von Erdogan an Grindel
With severe accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounced the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but never defends verbandslinie.
A new item is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation in the Permanent Way hema Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President's opening of the great Ditib-Mosque in Cologne, Germany strongly criticized the handling of the ex-World Champion in Germany, the DFB chief defended the verbandslinie.
At the early Sunday morning, the Özil personally rallied Grindel in Mainzer ZDF- "Sportstudio", which was attacked by Causa.
"As we have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migrant background in the U-teams - that something is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration representative.
At the same time, Grindel once again declared that Erdogan was not in favour of the values of football and the DFB.
This has been denounced with harsh words against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our in Germany born and grown Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they took photographs with me in England, "said Erdogan on Saturday in the city of Domstadt.
To be honest, I was unable to digest it as its president that our two young men, who were up to the German national team, were marginalised.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan ’ s statement that, unlike Özil, after the World Cup affair, which took photographs of the two with Erdogan, 'sensibly treated by the DFB'.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face up to players in the future.
That someone says: if I win, I am German, if I lose, I am Migrant - that is not going.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more and more, and I have always said so.
A basis for a return to the national team, however, does not see it either.
In addition to the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the family roots in Cameroon are to be called an additional integration officer.
"If, without a migrant background, it is clear in society and football and says: 'The issue is important, because we must take care of it', this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work ', said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup, and the Özil affair, he wants to run again in the coming year as President of the DFB.
"I do my work and try to make them as good as it goes," said Grindel.

The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve local stress situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs must continue to be allowed to be taken with explicit consent, and Swisstransplant stresses.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
The aim is to facilitate organ donation and relieve members of stress situations.
People who wish to make their organs available for death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved from Swisstransplant.

It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss donors have issued a certificate, says Franz Always, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only five percent of the cases will find a map at the crucial moment in possible donors.
In more than 60% of the discussions, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You must then decide on the basis of the deceased, which is often very burdensome", so always.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible donation of organs on the health card, as the speaker says in the Federal Center for Health Enlightenment, Marita Völker-Albert.
"A register in which people can contribute their wishes - per or contra organ donation - there is not 'says it.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
After his proposal, any organ donor would initially be considered, unless he or she contradicts members.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.

Schleswig-Holstein farmers are allowed to start their annual sticks on Monday.
The "green rolling", which is unique in Germany, has been the country's landscape for some 200 years.

Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, which can still work through the exchange of organisms, as the Managing Director of the Nature Conservation of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences.
The Knicks were defeated on the grounds of a commander of the Danish king Christian VI. in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fences, they also supplied firewood and beams for their specialist houses.
From that time, his name "Knick" also comes from: "By" knicking "the branches could develop the dense, fleshy delimitations.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea, there are some 45 000 kilometres of hedges and the image of an impressive, varied landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a replacement space.
In a kilometre of Knick, up to 1800 different species could live and up to 30 bird pairs.
Its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly maintained in winter.
In addition to the variety of species, Sonst has reduced the wind impact, he said Ludwichowski.
The Knickness Care may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesians talk about SItuation on site.
The Einheimische Radika Pinto describes in the interview with the German editorial network (RND) the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquake and the tsunami:
Do you have goods yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was at the moment in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
Since I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be used.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that are all completely destroyed.
Also our office of "World Vision" is destroyed, but we have arranged provisionally something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi?
Many are curious about surrounding hills where they still endure fear of another tsunami and earthquakes, and where they do not have access to water and food.
Some still hold their houses, there are still descendants.
Because many food stores and also the petrol stations are completely closed, people are sounding some food and petrol.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government helps.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partly free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information supply run on the island?
At the moment, however, we did not work and we only received information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who do not know whether they live and where they are staying because the people during the earthquake were not at home, but for example on the way.
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information about this?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region, and they are eager for the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which lies on the Pacific Fire ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
But, every day there are earthquakes, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuation.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake hit a lot of people.

And there were many corners and many balls in our penal room, "said the sports booth of Schalke 04 - and atmete.
After all, the kings of blue yet succeeded in bringing the scarce 1: 0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first Saisonsieg under the roof and trade.

In fact, no head ball-monster

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
They are the author, Professor Doktor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild for the.
"I made it my job to get interesting people after Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the Alliance of Cultural Policy ".
El-Mafaalani is very loose at reading, describing the writing process of the book, talking about how difficult it was to explain the subject clearly.
With much gesture, handfixed numbers and one or other joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting themes: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are there increasingly conflicts?
The syrischstämmige author uses metaphor to answer the question.
On a table, German society, at the cat table, is the migrants of the first generation.
Their children are growing up in Germany and want to be on the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and want to be involved.
That leads to conflict.
It is therefore crucial that we do not decide whether or not we are going to be politically or on the left, but: 'I am in favour of or against an open society'.
Initially rather behave, then he always rains the discussion round.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or not successful integration with students.
El-Mafaalani is not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor urges his opinion not to stress that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the subject, because 'only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions', says El-Mafaalani.
Also during the subsequent signing hour, he still has an open ear for the questions of guests and also in the foyer was discussed intensively at prepared Kurdish specialities.

For the third time not in the start eleven: nevertheless, Naldo is thanking for Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bank had sat, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two meters big Brazilians had been so right to the frustration of the soul.
But as the Schalker player after the 1: 0-victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle, and he trained Domenico Tedesco at all his professionals, the 36-year-olds, called the simplest half Naldo, and said; "We have to thank trainers, trainers!"
"This was very emotional, that was great sport," said Tedesco later about the reaction his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reserve existence, had no resurgence.
Probably lích knows Naldo, who was celebrated in the last season as the best songwriter, that he is not in fact on his trainer - but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It was not easy to tell him that.
"It was not easy to tell him that I tell you quite honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment when he said Naldo that he was not in the start eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it is always about the thing, it is about the club, founded Tedesco the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can get through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, "explained Tedesco the rotation that last also got Naldo.
And on the Brazilians with the wisdom of his advanced age, he reacted: he also looked at the bank as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria ’ s industry accelerated its downfall compared to the eurozone in August.
