This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not .	-4.4586

The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night !	-2.7061
Hamburg - The talk show " Inas Nacht " produced by NDR is known for lively discussions at the counter of the Hamburg harbour buttons " Schellfischtposten " .	-5.2274
Moderator Ina Müller joins up with her guests with a lot of beer , some wine , or even a drink with a higher percentage , to relax the mood and the tongue .	-8.0954

On Friday , another episode of the popular talk show was recorded .	-2.2146
This time , actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies such as " Men 's Hearts " , " Terror - Your Judgment " or " The Best Day " .	-5.4455
Munich got the trip to the far north but not at all good .	-4.6613
On Saturday he placed a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of . His face is , , , and .	-8.4237
The bed legend shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz .	-5.0572
But he is not sick , he has only a powerful hangover .	-2.8118
In response to his fans , he put forward some - perhaps not very serious - insights that he has now gained : " Rule one : Never goes to Ina 's night .	-7.5073
Rule two : never drink the black sow .	-2.9276
And injection .	-1.5324
And the egg liquor round that Ina cuts about half three also leaves away .	-7.0098
Alcohol consumption is written in the face of the 43-year-old .	-4.0062
His fans immediately posted some tips to fight the aftershocks .	-5.3354
They ranged from instant breaks , fish breaks , or perhaps the most targeted headache pills .	-6.0488
Others simply enjoyed watching the normally attractive movie star .	-4.7899
The way in which Ina Müller has managed to survive the night life is not yet known .	-7.4782
Since she has moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007 , the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested ...	-5.0941
On a beer with Ina Müller .	-1.2525
Treysa has to contend with vandalism and betrayal .	-2.8283
The access to the 36 km long railway cycle path in the Red Käppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired .	-5.6424
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought , but solutions are hardly apparent .	-3.3524
Scherben , Zigarettenkirppen , Müll und Unrat , demilzierte Mülleimer und mittlerweile hinweiser - so präsentiert sich seit längerem der Eingangssgruppe zum Radweg auf dem Haaße-Hütte in Treysa .	-6.0895
For the flagship project Railway Cycle Path in the Red Käppchenland a more than shameful sight .	-5.4873
Members of the German ADFC group Schwalmstadt have also been working on this topic for some time now , according to the City of Ulrich Wüstenhagen .	-7.7491
The problem has already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Council .	-3.2570
There is no solution .	-2.6123
The proposals ranged from the installation of the group of seats to the regular emptying of waste containers and the cleaning of areas at the point of entry .	-5.1556
" I think the latter would be the order of the day , regardless of possible further activities , " says Wüstenhagen .	-3.8733
Guido Hahn ( ADFC ) reported that the topic was also included in the local advisory board .	-3.9932
It is not only the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrations at weekends .	-5.8190
Not only does it often happen loud , but the yellow areas are also destroyed : the posts are torn out of the ground , the trash bin is demolished , signs are moved around , seating furniture is smeared .	-8.8495
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often , says ADFC member Susanne Klippert .	-3.5800
But the actions are just the proverbial drop in the ocean .	-3.0979
You are annoyed that the resting place on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for the rest .	-8.0373
" Along the entire cycle path , the emphasis is clearly placed here on the Haaße hill " , confirms the cycling authority , who is now also concerned about the new Ziegenhain cycle site that is opening today .	-8.4219
" If they suffer the same fate , it will be really expensive " .	-4.7218
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill : " This may set the threshold of attacking the common good much higher .	-5.3913
However , this would require a police strike to pass immediately .	-5.0940
In principle , Wüstenhagen wants to develop the Haaße hill .	-4.0583
It must be made more attractive .	-1.3103
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far .	-4.5523
The marketing of tourism can still be developed .	-4.1198
Our cycling path is of very high quality compared to others in Germany " , says the ADFC members .	-4.6475
As a highly critical point of danger , ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation at Ascherröder Strasse in Treysa .	-4.8239
There is no bending on the Haaße hill .	-3.4471
In the case of heavy traffic , cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of the traffic flow , " she explains .	-4.5164
This is not a problem for sports drivers , but for the elderly and especially for children .	-3.6600
Music Contest at the Cultural Centre : The " Hiltrup 's Kö " and the Lake .	-5.6042
The first call to the music contest was a success , creative and in cooperation .	-3.2444

A contest " with wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family " , as Karl Franke put it .	-3.6282
In fact , it was soon a family reunion with coffee and cake from the honorary officers of the cultural station .	-6.0077
Seven formations have appeared , from the one-man band to the large ensemble : Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied , Henk Humberg with guitar , Rolf Ihmig , a long alachner living in Hiltrup , the Nine of the " Hiltruper Sterns " , three members and three generations of the families of Trenkamp and Claus , an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwartis .	-7.1932
This contest , declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt , is a novelty .	-2.7298
We have not seen this in other parts of the city .	-2.9117
What were the writers associated with ?	-3.4208
In the places the Hiltruper lake and the market avenue were mentioned especially frequently .	-6.6283
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his striking song to the " Kö von Hiltrup " .	-6.0621
The cultural station was also recognised .	-4.0703
Again and again , it was a matter of experiencing coexistence in these places , especially at Alvin Jasic .	-5.2419
Karl Franke animated the short rebuilding breaks with short interviews with the artists or references to their work .	-3.5654
Humberg was told that he had actually studied chemistry , but now he also taught guitar .	-5.8432
Franke told the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest .	-5.6556
Meanwhile , Alvin Jasic placed a lot of things on Youtube .	-3.6147
" It is not about profits , " Franke said .	-3.1069
In fact , all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy .	-3.4740
There was something special for the judges ' favourites - so that others can also listen to their songs .	-4.9567
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann .	-3.7566
Other musicians can record a song : Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer , who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality , and the " Lummerland-Rudel " : " A very nice performance " with ten children and two teachers of guitar and Cajon , Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle .	-5.1752
Like everyone else , the children went to the final - and even without electronic support , they sounded " really good " , as Franke said .	-6.4287
The jury was guided by the aspects originality , relation to Hiltrup , unity of melody and recognition value .	-3.9608
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik , Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven , Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive .	-3.9668
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence .	-4.7577
She regarded the event as a complete success .	-3.3431
All were " very satisfied " , and " the atmosphere was good " in the soon very full Kulturbahnhof .	-4.5720
The Game of the Word : Decrypto	-3.2894
The players form two teams that are opposite each other .	-4.0198
There is a screen for each page , including four cards with keywords , which you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil - only after .	-6.5412
This ensures that the other side can 't read by mistake .	-4.2616
On the maps , for example , you can read from left to right : " 1st Renaissance .	-4.0075
2nd window .	-1.5246
3 . Dice .	-0.7207
4 . Feast ' . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-4.0072
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on .	-3.4356
It is not the concepts that should be guessed here , but codes .	-4.9340
One player per team is the key player .	-4.1073
He gets a code card which might contain " 3.4.2 " .	-3.7762
" Decrypto " should not guess the terms behind the secret film , but their encryption codes .	-4.3533
His task in this case : to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms " cube " , " feast " and " window " , in such a way that his own team can see the correct order and the opposing team can 't , if possible , win the game if he can break the code twice .	-8.1064
The keyer then notes and reads aloud : " Werfen " for the dice , " Lose " as a contrast to Fest ; here , of course , something like " party " would be possible and " Prague " because he has paid attention in school and knows the window collapse there .	-8.0591
So it goes on lap by lap , team by team .	-3.7185
You don 't know the terms of the opposite side - but you can more easily merge them with every hint the encryption user gives .	-8.4621
If you don 't know what to do , you 'll be able to find out what to do .	-12.9816
The most cryptic piece of " Decrypto " is the rule book .	-4.0939
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time before they can finally play .	-5.3604
The explanation video on decrypto.info on the net makes it easier .	-3.6328
But once you 've got started , you 'll be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game .	-6.4973
But overall " Decrypto " is not quite as conclusive as predecessor and genre Primus " Codenames " , which also puts an agency issue on a game of few words but is much better to play in small groups .	-6.1292
And if it ’ s just a matter of installments and not winning points , it ’ s easy to invent a version for two .	-5.9312

From 1977 they were only needed for freight trains .	-3.1463
Until 1991 , at least 10 000 weighing was still ranked in the month .	-4.9759
In 1982 , parts of the plant were abandoned , and in 1991 the rest were abandoned .	-5.1516
Heidrich : ' It is regrettable that we have not envisaged better use of the site , including in the area of freight transport ' .	-5.0856

And the Albachters also gave way to their displeasure .	-5.7680
At least five of them .	-0.9842
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir " Caesilia " there should be no more sangha in the district .	-7.1491
It has become a legend : at a bank in the Tinnenbusch , they launched the 68 Albatros MGV .	-4.6276

That does not break us .	-2.9226
I saw good volleyball in phases " , didn 't bother Annacker with the 0 : 3 - and went to the agenda immediately .	-6.1664
It seems impossible to see where the Independent will go after just three days .	-5.7226

Only in one he feels confirmed : " The 3rd league has an incredibly good level .	-2.7795

Her marriage to Hans von Borsody : Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband .	-2.4825
On the dream ship Heide Keller became a star .	-3.1535
Now she talks openly that the series may have been complicit in her divorce with Hans von Borsody .	-4.7424
Her role as Chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the dream ship made Heide Keller ( 76 ) famous , but on January 1 , 2018 she left the ship forever .	-5.3808
The series that made her star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody ( 1929 - 2013 ) , with whom she was married for ten years .	-3.0635
" This could also have been a reason .	-3.0255
For I grew up with this work , travelled around the world with a suitcase alone , and many colleagues whom I admired saw me on equal terms , " says Keller in conversation with the " Bild am Sonntag " .	-5.4391
At first she had always been " the wife of Hans von Borsody " , but that changed with the " dream ship " .	-4.2303
For now , the journalists were only calling at Heide Keller .	-10.3099
'I do not know whether he liked it so much ' .	-4.0020
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been envious , but " like many men Hans was afraid to talk about problems and feelings " .	-6.0187
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody " to be the only right one and he did not want to know my fears , my weaknesses .	-4.3786
In plain German , that means that I have lost my bearings ' , as she explains .	-6.2310
She always felt " not good enough for him .	-2.5560
He saw in me an emancipated woman , which I never really was , even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on stage .	-4.7795
I wanted our love to be forever " .	-1.9348
After an already failed marriage to Thomas Härtner , Keller said yes again , " although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time . "	-5.1089
On the day before the civil ceremony I was sitting hypocritically in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything .	-3.9580
In the same year , Borsody 's marriage to Borsody also failed .	-8.4377
Why never did it work with the men ?	-3.3970
Because I wanted too much .	-0.9170
Keller imagined love at the time " as in the film .	-4.5414
Unfortunately , this vision is not suitable for everyday use .	-3.1753
I have approached love far too naively " .	-3.4737

So on this late Thursday evening he torched over the square to ease himself in the " Aqualean WC Oasis " .	-6.3001
This is the name of the public toilet facility , sponsored by a large sanitation company , which is celebrating its premiere at the festival : the needlebuilding on the ground of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to create a luxurious ambience .	-8.8023
But this evening it stinks to the sky for some reason .	-5.8839
So get out here , over the other side of the street : Happy guests , who have just entertained the opening film " Green Book " at the cinema next door at the best level , celebrate the start of the festival like every year with a party in the three-story department store .	-8.1661
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival : as you know , the works shown come from all over the world .	-5.6482
What do you need to think about an article about this festival in order not to become a cover advertisement for its 190 partner companies ?	-6.4818
The Falter binds himself a small band around the feelers , which has put a good fairy into him , and two bullish turrets are really inviting him generously .	-10.2834
Inside , the geladens dance to live music well after midnight , or let DJ play the rhythms they catch each other , and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite appetizers .	-9.4279
At the delicatessen shop in the basement , oysters wait for sipping mouths , next door the incomparable Culatello di Zibello ham is freshly sliced and a chocolate fountain is bubbling .	-6.8295
And the hammer is : all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion .	-3.2789
This has been the case for years , so it seems to work without much loss .	-4.4263
We must love this country for that .	-3.3490
The Falter studies the shield at the escalator : " wear a long dress , please be careful on the escalator " .	-3.6889

And George Clooney , who has been promoting that brand for years , is not here in the evening either .	-3.7943
However , between local celebrities , cash desks and kitchen articles , a face is passing , which is known to the observer : Peter Farrelly , the director of the opening film .	-6.5564
His main characters will not be far away .	-4.8464
And really : Viggo Mortensen is walking through the crowd , with almost sixty of them working as a choir boy .	-7.6540
It is not squashed , it is not made , it is at most concealed .	-6.3538
International stars of this film festival love this restraint , which is often misunderstood as a verbosity .	-6.7102

His protégés were " destroyed on the ground " after the unfortunate 29 : 30 ( 12 : 14 ) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2 .	-5.2193
As in Steinhagen , and as against Hullhorst , they had not played badly over long periods , the senders .	-5.4322
Only the initial phase " we totally wasted " , annoyed the ASV trainer .	-4.8729
The owners quickly ran at 8 : 1 , even the early period of time taken by Biedermeier did not bear fruit .	-6.4268
" But then suddenly a pull through the team " , Biedermeier summed up the second quarter of an hour .	-5.4983
At the break , the lag was only two goals .	-3.4837

After the change , it became even better from a visitor ’ s point of view .	-3.6190
After 33 minutes , David Ernst left for 15 : 15 , followed by the relay changer .	-5.3169
Four minutes before the siren , the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits ( 29 : 26 ) .	-2.5312
And then ?	-0.7837
Bring the parties into the action .	-5.3614
Biedermeier is usually wary of trying to blame others .	-5.2785
But : The 120 seconds penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received was " a joke " .	-4.6848
LIT had laughing and met four times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack .	-4.3835
The guys fought great , stood against seven men in the back and threw them into the empty gate again and again .	-7.4914

Frank Schröder is the Engine Pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and therefore responsible for the pastoral needs of the PS strong two-wheelers .	-5.6846
Between April and September , the traditional motorcycle divine service ( MoGo ) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at the house Nordlight .	-5.8509
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season at the Peace Church in Eveking .	-3.7967
About 150 bikers had met there on Sunday to celebrate a service that was anything but normal .	-5.6453
From 10 o ’ clock onwards , the Boliden had woken up in front of the church entrance .	-6.7775
At first , the biker 's early gear was on the agenda and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty currywurst .	-8.2177
Besides the MoGo team there were also the Holy Riders , a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach .	-3.5339
The sermon was held during the Biker worship service priest Dirk Grzegorek .	-3.6740
Singer Songwriter Valerie Lill provided musical support .	-4.3303
" Although the bikers prefer blues rock , Valerie Lill is more poetic-quiet , " says pastor Frank Schröder .	-4.9909
This , too , was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle divine service yesterday .	-4.1340
Tucked after the apple comes milk	-5.4152
Borisch was also active during the actual day of action .	-3.2198
She served her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes .	-3.5419
Georg Hartmann Niemerg also aroused great interest .	-3.1144
He had his apple press in his luggage and gradually demonstrated to his astonished audience the process from the ripe apple to apple juice .	-3.7830
Then and when , Hartmann Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnels .	-4.6543
With a little muscle power , the apples became a finely chopped mass .	-3.2265
Not many of the children could imagine how they would become a tasty drink .	-5.2096
But you could also look at this important step on Friday afternoon .	-4.8947
Wrapped in shapes and wrapped in nets , Georg Hartmann ’ s Niemerg piled a layer on top of each other ’ s apple pieces , which look a little like a piece of chicken . .	-11.5615
Thanks to some technical support , the last step was not so difficult .	-4.0008
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel .	-3.5797
But the farmer , who is still alive , had already filled up specialties .	-8.0746
He opened his " treasure chest " and presented the latest feather white to the older visitors .	-4.6813
The demand for the good wine " Made in Füchtorf " was correspondingly high .	-3.5224
The parents met in a cosy atmosphere , while the children were able to follow not only the process of pressing the apple , but also discovered the fortified castle .	-6.6270
Activists of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers also took part in the festival and invited them to play for short .	-7.1215
The Heimatverein will also offer an action day in the coming year .	-3.8447
But then , as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out , the home house in the heart of the asparagus department will not be the place of events .	-5.5620
Instead , a farm will be visited .	-1.4296
This is also obvious because of the subject : after all , it will be about milk .	-5.8754
1 : 4 against Frankfurt : Hannover , with its fourth seasonal default : ' Lost situation '	-5.6491
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat , coach André Breitenreiter met his disappointed pros from Hannover 96 and gave them courage .	-5.7997
There were many positive things to see before at 1 : 4 ( 0 : 2 ) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt .	-5.1779
" It is a tricky situation , but you have to get out as a team , " said 96 football professional Pirmin Schwegler , who said : " This is disappointing , of course , because you always take a great deal of care " .	-8.4213
The more victorious Lower Saxony , for which only Florent Muslima ( 86 . ) joined , are at the bottom with two meters and are a relegation candidate in their current constitution .	-6.9889
On the other hand , Frankfurt celebrated its first season home victory , led by the outstanding Ante Revic .	-6.3274
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute , Rebic ( 45th + 1 ) , Jonathan de Guzmán ( 59th ) and Luka Jovic ( 89th ) scored seven points in the middle of the table in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFCup .	-10.0555
Croatia ’ s vice-world champion , Rebic , was involved in almost every dangerous offensive by the Hessen in his debut post and never got under control by Hannover- ’ s defence forces .	-10.7036
The striker , long hit after the World Cup , demonstrated with his speed and perseverance why he is so valuable to harmony .	-4.2752
In addition to Rebolic , the Brazilian Allan , who was hired by Liverpool FC , was the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurter , which started to be lively .	-10.0026
Lucas Torró ( 17 . ) was the first to put in danger .	-7.5275
Six minutes later , Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence against the Brazilian Felipe , who replaced the short-lived Kevin Wimmer ( back ) .	-5.0156
The leadership for the owners was almost inevitable and entirely deserved .	-3.8022
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defensive corner , Haller extended his head in front of the goal , where Ndicka only had to keep his foot .	-6.5659
It was the first Bundesliga left-winger for the French midfielder AJ Auxerre in the summer .	-6.2923
And Frankfurt shone before the break .	-2.9267
This time , Haller adapted to his storm partner , Revic , who was skilled in kneeling and allowed 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance .	-8.1644
In the middle of the year , Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak idea of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt .	-5.5994
Although the Niedersachsen played a little more courageous forward , inspiring ideas remained until the end when the meeting point was still successful .	-8.5628
The bosses were much more efficient .	-3.4546
After less than an hour , Rebolic started a solo and then put the ball right across De Guzmán , who had to push the ball into the empty goal .	-6.6262
The rest was just a show run for the Frankfurt people against overextended guests , Jovic also met one minute before the end .	-5.9855
Morlaixplatz Goes Party	-3.8424
Würselen Despite cool temperatures there was good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre .	-3.9455
The Munich Lord Mayor Dieter Reiter made it to millions of visitors at the opening of the 185 .	-4.0094
Munich Wies 'n last week with two shots .	-3.0125
Geisting : Geisting Christians Celebrating	-7.0300
The Catholic vultures celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or Sunday after .	-4.9743
The festive service takes place in the city church , followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the closing blessing .	-6.4520
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ from the Thirty Years War , on which a Swedish soldier is said to have shot .	-5.8775
Blood then flowed out of the wound of fire .	-2.8205
This led to a great pilgrimage to the gunned Christ , which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church .	-5.6046
This is still not finished , only the altar room stands , the missing nave is indicated by the trees .	-6.7525
In his sermon , pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope , comfort , and life .	-2.9355
The service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geissinger parish .	-4.8912
After the divine service the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the Kreuzfest ended .	-5.4714
For many years the Catholic church choir has also invited the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish home .	-4.8568
The members of the choir provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted , farm ice .	-5.1760
In the afternoon , the parish church offered guided tours around the city church , while Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to the façade , roof , sandstone works and windows , as well as the construction work that will continue until next year .	-7.8140
Since the framework has been in place for some time , the damage has been more accurately identified and the various calls for proposals have been prepared more specifically .	-6.2295
What is certain is that the renovation is more expensive than planned , because the damage that was already there a few years ago has increased , but more has been found , which was only possible by means of scaffolding .	-7.7462
The plaster work on the base has been completed , the work on the natural stone is to be started before the winter and it is hoped that half of this work will be completed this year .	-8.3423
Inauguration : New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblichstraße .	-6.1899
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblichstraße .	-3.3798
The fact that " a very special house " is now being handed over to the Münsterblichstraße - everyone present agreed at the opening date .	-7.0134
After all , the twelve wheelchair users who have already been living in the life aid home of Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building .	-5.4024
Broader corridors , corridors and doors , larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas has been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept .	-4.7669
The first plans began around eight years ago , when the former officers ' building of the US Army was put on the test bench for the residents with a handcap : " The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in its equipment , " Bader explained in retrospect .	-8.0695
In 2016 , the excavators mounted to tear down the house .	-3.1125
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel at home , according to the architect .	-5.5558
Danube Iller Lives New Home	-2.5291
About 4.6 million euros were invested in life support in the new building .	-4.3480
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros , the district of Swabia 450000 euros .	-3.7380
According to the architect Bader , the construction work remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially .	-6.4342
The Managing Director of Lebenshilfe , Jürgen Heinz , thanked him for this .	-4.0009
The gap between a barrier free and fire safe design was not always easy .	-3.9484
Nevertheless , the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help .	-7.4203
Likewise , Gertrud Kreutmayer , head of the Social Administration of the district of Swabia , said : " The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants , who need tools to be mobile " .	-6.0406
Kreutmayer said that living space and functionality were well combined .	-5.6522
And again : " The plot in this situation is a real stroke of luck because it is no longer available in today 's situation " .	-6.0465
In total , the new residential home in Münsterblichstraße offers space for 30 disabled people on nearly 1500 square metres , divided into three residential groups .	-6.9360
Heinz , the Managing Director of Life Aid , is proud of the eleven full-time employees , all of whom are employed by rate .	-5.4172
Germany : Sweeping bemoans the differences between East and West	-2.8806
Berlin - Prior to the Day of Unity , the Deputy SPD Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germany .	-6.5058
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years .	-2.4273
We cannot be satisfied with these differences , " said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , " Day mirrors on Sunday " .	-4.9927
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country .	-2.8152
It is unacceptable that East Germany , on average , worked longer than the people of West Germany , but would receive 15 % less .	-4.5654
" I cannot explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity , " said Schwesig .	-3.5968
North Korea : Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict ?	-2.3113
The one year old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas .	-3.9663
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul , Pyongyang gave South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs .	-3.3545
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday , the two dogs about a year old reached their destination on Thursday .	-4.1362
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food in order to " make it easier for animals to get accustomed " .	-6.1435
Dogs with thick white fur , pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent .	-2.8552
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .	-1.9707
The North announced the pledge at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang in mid-September .	-3.4074
Both countries also agreed to join forces in international sporting competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and jointly apply for the 2032 Olympic Games .	-4.1588
In the process of rapprochement , Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri missile test facility .	-4.2336
Austria ’ s Moved History in the Mirror of 99 Documents	-1.9964
What is Austria ?	-0.4054
Many new books have been published to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Republic , which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months now , most of which answer this question in a review of the past hundred years .	-7.0642
Wolfgang Maderthaner , historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives , in the magnificent " Bilderbuch " ( picture book ) of Austria , which will be published on October 1 , 2010 , .	-8.3791
New Week ’ s Government Opportunity	-2.6243
Back to the substantive work - that is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Grand Coalition starting today .	-4.8410
Hardly an interview , hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU , the SPD and also from the CSU did not last in a mantra-like way call for a ' return to the Sakharov work ' .	-6.4706
This may have led some craftsmen , doctors , cashiers and other working citizens in that country to ask the legitimate question , which is actually the difference between work and work , but so be it .	-6.5556
When the federal government is ready to return to its mission - governance - it should not be prevented from doing so now by debating terms .	-6.0028
Monday may already show whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and lamentations of recent weeks .	-5.8400
In the evening , the leaders of the governing parties meet for the Coalition Committee .	-3.4075
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflict early ; a lesson from all the dispute .	-4.4491
First of all , however , there are conflicting issues again on the agenda with regard to diesel upgrading and the law on skilled labour migration .	-6.5402
The CSU Transport Minister , Mr Scheuer , wants to allow the car companies to get off scot-free with exchange premiums , while the SPD and the CDU view manufacturers as being obliged to retrofit older diesel technology .	-7.1718
While the diesel crisis over the weekend has shown an approximation , the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the proposed law on skilled immigration .	-6.9493
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do an education .	-4.7029
The Union is strongly opposed to the ' change of track ' from the asylum system to the labour market .	-3.3867
So there will be arguments again among coalition partners - and how else ?	-4.2319
It is not equal to the GroKo , but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities .	-6.1140
Dispute is good .	-1.3766
Without a dispute , a society characterised by such diverse and sometimes contradictory interests does not move forward .	-4.7325
However , in order to be constructive , disputes must not be allowed to be blown up again for party-political reasons on the question of being or not being .	-5.7233
This is still about politics , not about theatre .	-2.5986
The Union and the SPD should argue , but always have a view on the reality of people 's lives . . . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.4933
What is feasible and beneficial to many ?	-1.9697
With this guiding question , both diesel and track change issues can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence .	-5.9921
That , above all , is what the parties must fight for now .	-4.3055
Pilz checks Working Time at Hartinger	-2.1831
Minister in Target	-2.0446
Does the Minister of Labour , of all people , violate current law of employment ?	-5.5578
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this .	-2.3945
" Really day and night " had their legislatures worked on the social security reform , reported an effusive Social Minister during the presentation of the same two weeks ago .	-7.0062
At Liste-Pilz-Mandarin Daniela Holzinger the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein ( FPÖ ) comes up with surprise - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question .	-4.4380
She assumes that ' the Minister only expressed her enthusiasm for the work of her team and never announced any violations of the law in force in front of current cameras ' .	-8.2149
Nevertheless , she now has questions in order to " be able to absolve drug dealers from any suspicion " .	-6.5813
The Police Shoot a Street in Search of Women	-5.0794
Marxgrün - The police did not want to comment on this for a long time .	-4.0309
Now we have confirmation .	-1.9059
Since early Saturday morning , the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been digging .	-4.2793
The route is closed until Monday in the Marxgrün area .	-3.8510
The investigators had previously used an archaeologist dog .	-4.8843
The dog , specially trained for the smell of old human bones , was able , together with his guide , to limit the relevant area to a few metres in several cases .	-6.7588
In addition , a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the supreme Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said street piece .	-6.1554
For more than a year already the public prosecutor and criminal police court have been working on the case of missing persons .	-4.8963
Time and again , a cycle path has been blocked by Marxgrün and investigated with sonars , because the investigators suspect that , as the state road was rebuilt , hot bodies may have been buried here 30 years ago .	-8.4312
Color powder and eggs : Barcelona riots before Catalonia ’ s anniversary	-4.4123
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia .	-2.3007
But riots are already occurring .	-4.6808
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the autumn of 2017 .	-2.0973
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017 , clashes between separatists and police occurred in the centre of Barcelona .	-3.4235
Catalan security forces were attacked , among other things , by the pro-independence activists , who wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the civil guard .	-5.8091
Some 3000 officials from the National Police and Civil Guard wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who were deployed in last year 's illegal referendum in the polling stations .	-6.5783
There was also violence at that time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting .	-4.5503
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate , Spanish media reported .	-3.8806
However , some of the 6000 or so separatists would then have violently tried to break the police chain and , among other things , used paint bags and eggs .	-10.1580
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured , they said , citing the authorities .	-4.3883
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum .	-2.2283
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain , the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under enforced administration in the autumn of 2017 .	-3.5728
The then regional president , Carles Puigdemont , fled into exile in Belgium .	-2.3739
Other politicians also turned abroad .	-3.3412
On the other hand , several ministers from the then regional government and other activists from the separatist movement remain in underground detention .	-4.2920
New elections were held in the region in December .	-1.6004
After the new Catalan government took office in May , the forced administration was brought to an end .	-3.6192
But the new regional president , Quim Torra , also insists on the Catalans ' right to self-determination .	-3.2409
Football : Oberliga Westfalia : Stunned perplexity : FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split torlessly .	-7.3367
Rot-Weiß Ahlen continues on the spot .	-3.2538
Even the FC Gütersloh won only a 0 : 0 draw .	-4.2281
They turned the rear light and the third last into a gathering of perplexity in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadium .	-7.0076
The room was very small and the bed was very uncomfortable .	-7.9286
If you would rather get a beer or a sausage , you could do so without worry .	-6.6755
There was no danger of missing a chance because there were virtually none .	-3.7312
First shot after half an hour	-2.3168
Nick Flock was responsible for the first ( harmless ) shot of the entire game .	-4.6183
The best - and , in principle , the only real - opportunity was the Ahlener , when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westerterling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the prison border .	-6.9016
The hosts were even more harmless .	-1.4584
Their most effective action was early change .	-2.3773
It was necessary to replace striker Lars Schröder for reasons of injury , for which Sinan Aygün came .	-6.1433
After the change , both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom .	-3.2820
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel , from 18 meters just above the housing , and after an hour the goods slother also appeared on the offensive for the first time .	-7.7213
After a major conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz it was fixed .	-5.4183
" Nick Flock ( 62 ) " crowns the quickly performed Konter over Sinan Aygün with a slight shot into the arms of the RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann .	-7.1782
They also played with a Wieckowicz ( 66th ) football after a corner ball by former ancestor Tim Manstein .	-6.9778
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded , first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy ( 60 ) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel ( 70 ) .	-3.6983
It did - nothing .	-1.6857
The ancestors did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative .	-4.2439
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance , but that didn 't bring anything .	-4.3145
Angelo Daut tried to underline the positive : " I like the fact that we have played to zero " , but unfortunately the zero was at the front .	-8.0329
" This time we were not as dangerous as we were against wood development and this even though our opponent did not want to play with us , " said RW Ahlen 's interim trainer .	-7.2189
Offensive " appealed everything so a bit " against a team that just wanted to defend .	-4.3469
In any case , I did not feel that we could achieve an opposite , " says Daut .	-4.9391
But , to his shame , the audience did not feel as though his team could score a goal .	-5.9245
The idea was too weak .	-2.6278
Reckenfeld ’ s Harvest Market : Fortunately enough Kremers exist .	-4.8834
Brigitte Ransmann , Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld blackboard office for which these donations are intended are pleased .	-10.1804
The honorary assure : " These donations remain in Reckenfeld " .	-4.0081
At the opening the sky was shining blue , while the space was still somewhat empty , but that should change in the course of the day . .	-7.3306
Because : " Here it 's so nice to socialise , that 's why we 're here today , " said a visitor .	-5.7179
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holhaust welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as usual with a good sense of humour .	-6.1153
For the couple Brockmann , who was supposed to be weighed up for food , Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer intervened in the short term .	-5.2976
Verena ( daughter of Ferdi Kreimer ) became ill .	-2.7062
But there are enough of them .	-3.0959
And the " replacement " could not be taken to entertain the growing number of visitors musically .	-6.6095
This was so good that at the late hour some folk songs were sung .	-4.2865
" Simply great " , Marcel Kreimer was delighted .	-3.0374
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer placed the opening date in his schedule this time .	-3.6504
He is happy about the many activities with their stands , including mostly clubs .	-5.1144
" Actually there should be no such thing as a blackboard " , he nevertheless thanked the male choir for the action .	-5.1462
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who worked at the stands and also included the further celebrations and the " Clean Up " action that took place in .	-9.0185
Our garden town is colourful - there is something going on here .	-4.6984
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took the corn counter with the help of the fire brigade and brought it to the winter quarter .	-6.3110
Many stands were used for the physical well-being .	-4.4130
From sweet to heart everything was to have .	-3.8677
Stefan Hagemeyer , who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year , became creative on his decapier saw .	-3.6362
He had a range of veneer work , a beer lid with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more .	-7.1086
A speciality was offered by three reckenfelder beekeepers : " Reckenfelder Honey " , brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka , Christian Wedershaven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter .	-6.7809
The latter has a speciality .	-2.9062
Honeycake in the glass , of course with honey from my own production .	-2.4130
The little Elsa had to access time and time again , so tasty the cake .	-4.4957
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to linger long into the evening hours , even without a stage programme that is not available during the autumn festival .	-6.9317
Lubrication with a local political message : no successful advertising of skateequipment	-5.6092
In Len , unknowns have promoted the construction of a skate facility in a way that is hardly profitable .	-6.8769
According to Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN , there are a number of blacksmiths .	-8.4656
In at least one case , the police have been subject to criminal notification of property damage .	-5.4555
In large letters , the three words " skate park for Len ! " have been printed on signs , including the Gemptt Hall and the Old Town Hall .	-8.2417
Michael Rottmann , manager of the hall , reports that a corresponding inscription has already been discovered on the advertising sign at the entrance to the Gempt-Bistro after the professional election fair on 19 September .	-6.7115
Since the short message had apparently been left " only " with an Edding , it could easily be removed .	-5.1887
" A few days later , however , this was back , this time sprayed up , " says Rottmann .	-5.7401
It assumes that the relevant advertising sign must be replaced .	-4.2095
This is particularly notable for the fact that several large companies from Len are also listed on the table .	-8.1187
If the skate facility is built , it should also be made possible by sponsors .	-4.7974
Commitments have already been made , explained Jörg Hesselmann of the urban school , sport and culture departments , without naming names .	-5.6120
It is possible , however , that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies on the awarded board .	-5.5723
For years local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding .	-5.0437
After the old one at the LWL clinic was dismantled , after some time the search for an alternative location began .	-7.2317
Finally , the majority of the Council spoke in favour of the fire parking lot .	-4.6705
However , this was not implemented - too many factors apparently opposed construction here .	-5.4789
There was a U-turn at the end of June .	-2.3520
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the premises of the Gutenberg School .	-3.6816
On the state of affairs , Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning .	-4.5618
The last word then comes from the town council .	-3.8723

Making Worse , the Flight Control Shortage	-5.6310
Frankfurt / Hamburg Following the European air traffic chaos in the summer , German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year .	-3.5697
" This year we had wind , in 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm , " said the chief of the air traffic control union , Matthias Maas , the German Press Agency , before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October .	-5.2668
An important reason for the numerous delays and failures in flights is the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic control , for which there is no quick solution .	-7.4017
" Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year , but training for new pilots will take four to five years , " said the trade unionist .	-6.4420
Across Europe , the market for fully trained pilots is empty .	-3.8048
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone , some hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace .	-4.4825
Maas once again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit .	-2.9937
On Friday , representatives of the Federal Government , the Länder , air traffic control , airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic City to address the causes of the delays .	-5.2148
" If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime , this will not be possible without us , " explained the head of the GDF , who has many members at the Federal German Air Safety Agency .	-6.5841
Maas again blamed EU Commission guidelines for the piloting plight .	-4.8440
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period until 2019 were far too low .	-3.1722
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings at national flight insurance companies have now been fully integrated into the operational business .	-6.9938
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer ( CSU ) to push for regulations in Brussels that " do not further reduce air safety " .	-5.2931
At the moment , the EU targets would be agreed by 2024 , and further tightening is to be feared .	-5.1304
The EU is under constant pressure from airlines to lobby .	-2.9110
" Ryan 's boss Michael O 'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years , " said Maas .	-4.4057
He hopes that the high costs of delay will lead to a change of thinking on the part of the airlines .	-5.4583
The GDF will only help to improve the situation if the German Air Traffic Control ( DFS ) offers a " coherent training and future pact " , said Maas .	-4.1361
The annual admission of 120 pilots over the next five years , which has been announced so far , is sufficient to compensate for age-related drops .	-7.0229
The necessary recruitment is not yet connected with this .	-3.8967

The will of Thyssen 's interim chief executive , Guido Kerkhoff , who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday , is to split the crisis group into two separate companies .	-6.3148
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange .	-2.4969
There should be no further reduction in staff beyond the cuts already known in administration .	-4.8605
After two resignations , the supervisory board counts only eight heads on the capital side .	-3.7018
There are ten employees .	-5.0046
However , the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020 .	-2.8222
The new ThyssenKrupp Materials AG will include , among other things , the 50 % share from the merged steel business with Tata , an Indian partner .	-4.6190

Barcelona : Violence against demos of police and Catalan independence supporters .	-3.4958
Two simultaneous demonstrations in Barcelona by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters have involved violent clashes with many injured .	-4.9568
According to the city council , on Saturday , around 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered , as well as around 6,000 pro-independence protesters .	-5.5219
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protests from one another with a huge amount of money .	-5.6444
According to the forces , however , independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier .	-5.2721
They would have attacked the officials with paint and throwing shots .	-3.3753
According to the figures , there were also rankings between the participants in the various protests .	-5.3648
According to the rescue services , 24 people were injured .	-2.1049
The police said there were six arrests .	-2.4667
Better salaries and allowances for colleagues	-3.2372
In their demonstration , the police wanted to pay tribute to those colleagues who , almost exactly a year ago , opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia , which was banned by the Spanish central government .	-5.2361
At the same time , they demanded better salaries .	-1.6656
Members of the Spanish police and the Civil Guard feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn considerably more than they do .	-3.8708
The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona , of all places .	-4.1306
" Why did they come here to protest ? " asked the 55-year-old Catalan protestant Manel Perez of AFP news agency .	-3.1942
Just to provoke and to celebrate the fact that a year ago they sank us .	-3.5548
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands , who wanted to name himself only with Daniel , rejected the charge .	-4.3003
" Of course we want to support our comrades who only did their duty last year : to defend the law , " he said .	-3.0121
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona , because it is a great European city and there is more echo here .	-3.9737
But he and his colleagues " did not come to provoke , " the policeman assured .	-3.1388

Football : Juve trainers praise Ronaldo ’ s Best Game	-4.0003
The Portuguese star striker " played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia , " praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3 : 1 ( 1 : 1 ) victory of the record master against the SSC Naples .	-4.8474
For the coach , the highly purchased star was also the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer without his own goal .	-6.5283
" Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is good , " said Allegri .	-3.3699
Although we started with tactical mistakes , Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown .	-4.2722
Thanks to Ronaldo 's three goal templates , Juve turned the game after the early lag by hitting Dries Mertens ( 10th minute ) and suspended the worst runner for the time being .	-6.0746
Real Madrid coach Mario Mandzukic , a former Bundesliga professional , first set up the team with a double pack ( 26 / 49 ) .	-11.3706
Ronaldo also did the preparatory work for the match of Chief of Defense Leonardo Bonucci ( 76th ) , who had to hit the front line just before the goal line .	-9.0612
" He gives many templates " , praised the coach .	-2.7554
But Allegri also wants to see goals of the attacker , who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of record defenders .	-3.8662
" We need to be even better at serving him , " the coach said .	-3.1108
The best juve archer is now Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in his account .	-4.6471
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than € 100 million , the superiority of Juventus seems to be even more pressing .	-4.5323
Seven wins in seven games is the immaculate series A. At 21 points , the champion of the past seven years already has six meters ahead of Naples .	-5.9067
The second table , trained by the former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti , was not without chance against Turin .	-4.4105
But at the latest after the end of the qualifying session of Mario Rui ( 58 . ) , who had already been thrown , the first .	-9.4588
The Portuguese had to get up too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the place .	-4.7195

There was also the possibility to feel attracted by Emre Can .	-6.7617
The German national player won Juve .	-4.3829
The professional from Liverpool FC was in action on all seven League games .	-5.0243
Ronaldo was also a midfielder in the Champions League match against Valencia , which Allegri said with the " half hour " : Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2 : 0 victory of the Turines and is locked for the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern .	-9.9828
The West Changing its Name	-4.2101
With a particularly bizarre appearance , Rapper Kanye West captured attention at the US TV show " Saturday Night Live " at the weekend .	-5.6369
Among other things , his performance together with Lil Pump caused eyebrows and question marks among the spectators in a mineral water costume .	-4.9672
In addition , the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album .	-3.6817
From then on he can only be called " Yes " , so the musician .	-5.2732
" The creature that used to be known as the Kanye West , " he tweeted to the late singer Prince when he gave up his name .	-5.6343
However , the pseudonym is not news .	-2.4550
Already the tenth album was released under this name .	-2.3728
In an interview with the radio station KRRL , the artist explained that " Yes " had a religious meaning for him .	-3.8786
" I think " Yes " is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means " you " , says the rapper .	-3.8178
Football : Kreisliga A1 Münster : Finally !	-2.0234
Get it done !	-2.8084
Hoetmar ’ s coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment .	-2.7398
That was a poor game of ours today .	-3.5307
The opponent was simply more effective , we almost never posed him problems " .	-6.3633
With two or more chances of scoring in 90 minutes , it is rarely possible games .	-8.4016
Bundesliga A1 : SC Hoetmar is SG Sendenhorst with 0 : 2 ( 0 : 1 ) photo : Heinz Schwackenberg .	-3.1675
The SG also had only two options in the first round , but the first was to use Maik Krause from a pointed angle for early guidance ( 7 ) .	-5.7316
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have raised , but after great preparatory work by Krause he decided to hang up freely .	-6.7845
The hosts had only a double chance when Moritz Höne , an goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher , first failed and Jan Blome also found his master in the sendenhorster Keeper in the .	-6.7905
After the break , the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities .	-3.0516
But Uphus ( 49 . ) , Julian Turl ( 61 , ) and Heinz Linnemann ( 69 . ) all gave .	-2.4235
A trade metre - Louis Kortenjann had rescued with his hand on the front line and saw red - moreover , Niklas Eilmann could not use it for the guests either ( 75 ) .	-6.6790
It was only when Nils Berheide shot the ball over the line that the game was decided ( 81 . ) .	-5.3764
" We had criticised each other hard before , but that was different today than in the last few weeks , " read Florian Kraus .	-5.8019

Football : Kreisliga A2 Münster : Spectacle Football in Albachten : GW Albersloh is Concordia with 3 : 4 .	-4.6073
" I don 't know what to think about it , " he said .	-4.8917
" We didn 't get access to it at all , " he said , presumably , the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger , but also all the other green whites with a collective offensive drive .	-8.2275
He was still able to laugh : " A dirty victory , " he still said , " a stingy cheeky , and attracted danish players to note the relief that they had pulled out of the affair with three points .	-10.6069
Mind you , after a duel between two teams , one of which , namely Albachs , is playing for the championship and the other , Albersloh , is fighting for class preservation .	-6.0408
With understandably mixed feelings , GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him .	-2.7719
" That was by far our best season performance , " he says .	-2.6533
" How we come back after the 0 : 2 , how we keep against one of the top teams of the league over the whole time , that was really phenomenal " .	-6.6137
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to drive home empty-handed .	-3.7483
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner led the host with his 12th season encounter ( 24 ) .	-4.5372
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal .	-2.3012
The 2 : 0 he set up on the left side for Fabian Fröhning ( 39 . ) .	-5.5188
We knew that , but such a player cannot be taken out completely .	-6.3001
" This was madness , what he did , " Lewandowski flatly recognized the quality of the opponent .	-6.0228
Shortly before the side change , his own elf managed to balance : McGill 's freekick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concorde goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long Toreck ( 45 . ) .	-6.0039
After the change of sides it was McGill again who achieved the balance ( 59 . ) .	-5.9048
Then it went back and forth .	-2.4414
It was a tight , action-packed game .	-2.6946
Nübel shocked Albachten again ( 64th ) , only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann met ( 69th ) .	-4.9863
However , Alberslow did not manage to beat the last Concorde hit ( 80 ) again .	-7.5112
We must now focus on Wednesday .	-3.3632
" The game against Schapdets is what we must win now , " said Lewandowski .	-4.7624

That was also the case , with Beethoven and Chopin , but it was different , the way it was the red thread of the evening .	-6.0765
Teubner had put a paradox into play : satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner but does not open the door .	-5.6265
A closed door without a partner , on the other hand , is of no use .	-3.3995

For legal reasons , all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October .	-2.3016
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step towards becoming the world 's largest industrial gas company .	-3.1043
China ’ s competition authority approved the proposed merger , Linde announced on Sunday .	-3.2047
This means that permits in South Korea and , as the biggest obstacle , in the United States still stand for the billionaire merger .	-6.4824
Most recently , an insider said that there was a better chance of an insider 's agreement , because Linde promised to sell additional company parts .	-6.3765
For legal reasons , all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October if the merger is to succeed .	-3.6067
From pure fruit to ecology	-6.1088
The 125th anniversary of the Association for Gardening and State Administration was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger Hall .	-5.2485
On September 29 , 1893 , the last impulse for establishing the district association for horticulture and state care Kulmbach was set with a show of fruit at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus , and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle .	-6.9897
In 1893 , Mayor Wilhelm Flessa baptised him as " District Obstacles Society of Kulmbach City and Land " .	-6.6120
The purpose of the fruit growing association also differed from today 's work - it was in fact a question of fruit growing , flowers and horticulture that no one thought about at that time .	-8.8443
" At that time , in the era of the Enlightenment , the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites , " said District Home Secretary Günter Dippold in his lecture .	-5.0317
Fruit trees were to line roads , and industrial gardens were created at schools .	-5.8233
Fruit growing is still the responsibility of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach , which comprise almost 7000 members .	-5.4867
But that is far from exhausted .	-3.1105
Natural horticulture , biological plant protection , village beautification and nutrition play an important role as well as the teaching of knowledge , a healthy diet and youth work .	-6.0178
The members of the Hutschdorfer Youth Group " Maulden " showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are .	-6.3830
" Youth work is urgently needed , especially in the digital age , " said District Chairman Günter Reif , and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important nature experiences are for life .	-5.0242
The box collection was a huge issue for us children , and I doubt that you will be able to enjoy the same amount with Smartphone & Co .	-7.8368
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner .	-2.9622
" Where they should stand , it is the Kreisverband that decides " , added Landrat Söllner and stressed the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages .	-6.7247
The district association stands for ecology , the beauty of the garden and green areas in the village .	-3.7569
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt as to the fact that the district manager and expert adviser Friedhelm Haun had .	-8.1533
He led the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a presentation of the need for self-sufficiency after the war .	-7.4852
In the past , everything came out of the garden , for the winter it was poured in .	-5.1067
At the end of the 1950s , however , the garden turned into a decorative and residential garden .	-5.1204
" Nature has survived , it was here before us and we must follow it " , the expert said for fruit and nut trees .	-6.4182
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up so that our homeland remains beautiful and liveable .	-6.6799
In addition , the President of the Bavarian State Association , Wolfram Vaitl , added that we should welcome the new citizens to our clubs .	-6.5207
" We have to stop the blatant decline in insects , we owe it to our children and grandchildren , " Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony , which was solemnly framed by the towers of the music club Thurnau .	-5.9570

Protests Against Presidential Candidate Bolsonaro	-1.3054
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro , who was injured in a trade fair attack , has left the hospital .	-4.2188
The extreme right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro , where he lives , according to a report from the daily newspaper " O Globo " .	-4.2212
After his release , it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform publicly in South America last week before the presidential election .	-4.5189
At the beginning of September , the politician had been assaulted on the street during a campaign in southern Brazil .	-4.9840
Meanwhile , thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro .	-2.2905
Under the title " Ele não " ( in German : " Der nicht " ) women 's associations in particular called for protests against the ex-military .	-4.2604
Bolsonaro was the first woman to win the World Cup .	-12.6391
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo .	-2.2378
In the capital , Brasilia , the protests were mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers ’ Party ( PT ) , Fernando Haddad .	-3.8174
He replaced former President Inacio Lula da Silva , who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand .	-5.9785
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7 .	-2.0348
As an ex-mayor of São Paulo , Haddad has been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far .	-4.5368
The " Trump of Brazil " has long been involved in politics , but has recently become an anti-system candidate .	-4.2968

The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead .	-0.9431
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness , his producer Jörn Jeppesen informed on Larsen 's website .	-3.8667
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children on the deathbed .	-3.0301
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year .	-3.1218
Larsen had become famous with the band Gasolin , which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s .	-4.3711
Their songs were influenced by international music stars like Jimi Hendrix , Bob Dylan and the Beatles .	-3.6258
After the band 's dissolution in 1978 , Larsen was successful as a solo artist .	-2.8692
He sold about three million records in Denmark .	-1.9595
His album " Midt om natten " from 1983 is still the most sold album in Denmark .	-4.4646
The Danish Prime Minister , Lars Lökke Rasmussen , praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a ' street boy ' who was ' against everything but in all hearts ' .	-4.8466
The head of the government also reminded us that Larsen , an opponent of monarchy , had appeared on Denmark ’ s Queen Margrethe II ’ s 70th birthday in 2010 .	-4.7699
Rocknight in the shoe factory : Volume at the level of compressed air hammers	-5.8915
The band names of " Here We Stand " , " Tiger Bonesaw " and " The Ignition " suggest a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik .	-6.5228
After the soundcheck and shortly before the concert begins , the musicians even take time for a group photo .	-4.3027
No trace of stage fever .	-3.3682
After that , the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency " Mosquito " from Oelde - with their bands will delight the approximately 120 visitors of the " Mint Mosquito " rock night .	-6.6744
Already the quartet " Tiger Bonesaw " with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the newest , unknown pieces from his own pen and the forthcoming CD .	-6.9113
In front of the stage , the band will perform in harmony and intensity .	-6.8797
" Tiger Bonesaw " will leave the stage to the trio " Here We Stand " .	-5.0810
Hard rock is not the same as hard rock , but guitar player Sascha Bregenhorn , Golo Meielenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds , sometimes reminiscent of the classic rock of the 1970s .	-6.7350
After the " High Energy Rock " of the " Tigers " , a synthesizer is also used at " Here We Stand " in addition to the guitar skirt .	-7.7194
Not only the longlasting , almost ballad-like " Take Me Home " impresses with the change of melodic passages to the guitar heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs .	-5.1913
However , the quartet " The Ignition " from Tönnishäuchen has earned a special reputation since its foundation in 2005 .	-4.5932
On Saturday , the band will be presenting their hard rock with full agility .	-5.8408
The fact that " The Ignition " has special stage experience with its performances to a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis on the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable .	-5.5175
In cooperation with the band , singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann sets new accents for the only recorded song of the evening , " Word Up " from Cameo from the 80s .	-6.6369
In addition to the soulful sound , guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a acclaimed solo while running through the audience .	-7.6253
A certain volume is part of this kind of hardrock concert due to the frequency of the band . According to the information of the mixing desk team , the " Mint Mosquito " rock night is about 98 decibels at the three concerts of " Here We Stand " , " Tiger Bonesaw " and " The Ignition " .	-9.0434
This is at the level of pneumatic hammers , for example , but is still significantly below the control of the " Wacken-spec " , to which " The Ignition " is referred on its website .	-11.8461
This rock night , however , does not require the ears numbing 120 decibels in nozzle volume , as is the case with the annual metal seal in the north of the republic .	-8.8938
After less than four hours , the three bands of the harder , rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign , virtuoso play and their own compositions .	-7.0359
" Here we stand , have taken the bone saw and set off a concert evening with the power of a tiger , " all three groups can say at the end , figuratively , of course .	-5.2580
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors .	-2.8457

A Sailplane Accident Toter at Essen / Mülheim Airport	-3.5349
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Essen Airport .	-2.2742
A sailplane crashed on Sunday at a car park at Mülheim / Essen Airport .	-3.3387
The pilot died in the accident .	-1.6018
There was a fatal accident near the airport of Mülheim / Essen on Sunday .	-3.3013
As the " Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung " reports , a glider crashed at the airport 's parking lot .	-4.8189
The pilot died .	-1.7393
As the " WAZ " continues to report , the student was alone on board - the plane should be a single-seater .	-6.5040
The aircraft was already in the landing at the time of the accident .	-4.0115
The crash site is only a short distance away from a tent on the airport grounds .	-4.0174
But since this weekend there has been an October festival .	-3.5450
Mülheim / Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr cities and directly on the driveway to the A2 motorway .	-7.3386
From the parking lot there is a Park & Ride offer at major events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen .	-5.2638
Trump is skyrocketing Kim : " And then we fell in love . "	-5.9739
The fact that North Korea ’ s president , Kim , is well disposed despite the nuclear crisis is no secret .	-3.1256
Now Trump has made a real love statement to his colleague .	-3.6579
It also has to do with Kims " beautiful letters " .	-3.5606
At the tender age of 72 , the married US president announced a new flame .	-3.3828
The tragedy : it is a distant relationship .	-1.9381
On Saturday , Donald Trump publicly offered North Korean leader Kim Jong-un an unusual declaration of love .	-2.9446
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia , Trump found almost incensed words for the semi-old pyromaniac of Pyongyang ’ s ruling dynasty , though the struggle for North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament is proving to be a rather tough chunk .	-8.6566
“ I was tough , he was , and we went back and forth , ” Trump reported .	-4.1475
And then we fell in love .	-1.6077
Okay ?	-1.0115
No , indeed .	-1.5799
And it is not only talks with Kim that would have melted his heart .	-3.4064
He wrote beautiful letters to me , they were great letters .	-3.1303
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit : Trump referred to Kim ’ s announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests , though critics have so far paid little more than lip service .	-4.7542
The US president seemed well aware that the affection for the infamous " Rocket Man " – Trump ’ s nickname for Kim – might not be palatable to everyone .	-5.9523
In any case , he immediately anticipated the expected criticism when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling : " Donald Trump says they have fallen in love " .	-5.4733
How terrible , how terrible is that ?	-2.3952
That is so unpresidential .	-3.7423
But he didn ’ t care much about it , Trump said , and then pointed his finger at the crowd : “ I have always told you it ’ s so easy to be presidential . ”	-6.1180
But then there would not be 10 000 people out there in this crowded arena , but we would only have 200 people out there .	-5.6992
October attracts many guests to Baesweiler .	-3.1903

Saved Refugees by Video from Libyan Prison	-1.6850
Nigerian refugees , using a mobile phone video , have highlighted their catastrophic conditions of detention in Libya , enabling them to be rescued .	-4.6547
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and distributed it online .	-5.1311
" They refuse to send us back , " said a man in the video message .	-2.1630
We are suffering here , we are dying here .	-1.4233
The recording was sent to the " France 24 Observers " website , whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) .	-3.1641
The refugees were finally sent to Nigeria at the end of August .	-2.8759

He was the only one who was able to get his life under threat with the video .	-10.7862
One of his companions was almost beaten to death by the authorities , said Onyeka .	-4.9768
Generally speaking , the conditions of detention were disastrous : ' You beat us all with pipes and sticks ' .	-4.0955
They gave us nothing to eat , we had to drink from the latrine .	-2.3635
The IOM is organising the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya .	-1.7168
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria had been sent back home this year through the program , said the IOM speaker in the West African country , Jorge Galindo .	-4.1184
The case of Nigerians now rescued is not exceptional in view of Libya ’ s poor prison conditions .	-3.6828
He hasn 't heard of a mobile phone call yet .	-4.3130
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libya ’ s refugee camps as degrading .	-3.0631

A 75 year old man had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in central Franconia after having stuck the car off the beaten track and a tree blocked the car door .	-7.1402

The Rule of Law in Turkey	-2.9163
Cologne Prime Minister Armin Laschet ( CDU ) , in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , has stated that he is calling for the rule of law in Turkey .	-5.3937
The two countries ' relations are currently ' overshadowed ' , said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport .	-3.5667
This particularly concerns the waves of arrests , freedom of the press and freedom of religion .	-6.0524
He has therefore ' made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future , if economic relations are to be deepened , the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this ' .	-4.8101
According to his own data , Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey .	-3.9797
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected .	-2.2798
Erdogan subsequently reaffirmed the independence of the Turkish judiciary .	-3.1891
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence ’ s readiness to fly at Cologne Airport .	-4.6084
Originally , it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn – but the castle owners rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan .	-7.0845
Following the conversation , Erdogan continued to attend the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne .	-3.3042
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building .	-4.0473
However , he said : ' The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country ' .	-2.8948
We are also their contacts - not the Turkish President .	-3.1415
Missing Confidence in the US : North Korea Calling for Disarmament	-3.1588
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the success of negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea , the East Asian regime is more sober .	-4.1378
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to be accommodating .	-3.0550
North Korea ’ s foreign minister , Ri Yong Ho , has accused the US government in the UN general debate of blocking negotiations on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with continued sanctions .	-6.6166
" The recent stalemate is due to the fact that the US is relying on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building , " said Ri in New York .	-4.7061
Disarmament is unthinkable in these circumstances for North Korea .	-2.4677
" Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm , " said the North Korean chief diplomat .	-4.7916
The fact that sanctions could ' bring North Korea to its knees ' is ' a pipe dream of people who do not know us ' .	-4.2819
But , to build confidence , his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility , Ri emphasized .	-3.8406
On the US side , however , there have been no " corresponding reactions " , the minister criticized .	-5.0355
For North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program , the UN Security Council decided three times last year alone to impose sanctions on the internationally isolated country .	-3.7015
US President Donald Trump and his foreign minister , Mike Pompeo , have been pressing the United Nations for strict compliance with sanctions in recent days .	-3.5127
At the same time , the US government is working toward convergence .	-2.5961
In June , Trump first met North Korea ’ s leader , Kim Jong-un .	-1.4144
After the first summit in Singapore , the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim .	-2.4056
In October , Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on ending North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons program .	-2.7650
The HoT Serves : New kitchen with community donations	-5.9091
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting was something of which the many visitors of the House of the Open Door got nothing from HoT : White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet was waiting for the guests after the Harvest Service .	-7.3258
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen .	-3.5593
The institution was funded by donations from the community , for which the young people wanted to thank them for their food .	-5.5235
The launch of the new facility was not exactly easy , as Henriette Westbuer , head of the HoT , remembers .	-4.2092
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day .	-4.3490
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise : a power failure had disabled the huge two-part refrigerator , the food had dried up and had to be disposed of .	-5.8429
" Now we have had to start again from scratch : we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbours , but the children and young people wanted to do it on their own , " says Westbuer .	-5.4969
And so they all took part .	-4.3382
The result could be seen , the guests were enthusiastic .	-4.3738
" It 's not possible to cook better , " praised a visitor , while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were served with quiche , liver cheese or cake .	-7.5634
" It 's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet , " said priest Frank Beckmann , while wizards have surprised Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other pieces of art .	-5.6530
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW state board .	-2.9573
Out of frustration with criticism from our own ranks , Jörg Sartor , the chief of the Essen Tafel , left his post in the Landesverband .	-6.3705
Sartor had become known throughout Germany because the Essen Tafel had introduced a stop for foreigners .	-4.8837

Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are gasping for Tuesday .	-4.2959
For the first time in more than a year , no goal has been scored abroad , as at the same time of the early season two mandatory matches in series without victory , the lead in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being .	-7.9914
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of Carlo Ancelotti ’ s failure at the end of September 2017 , the record-keeper must be warned .	-4.2300
The FC Augsburg on 1 : 1 with its intense man-to-man tactics and the Berliner with their playful needle stiches over the outside have delivered two blue pauses within three days , just as the last overmighty Bayern are to be cracked .	-10.5964
" Those who know the FC Bayern know that we will not tolerate this and we will do everything we can to ensure that we succeed again , " said Kovac .	-5.8401
But he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city , and only pushed his first defeat as Munich coach to the once again poor handling of opportunities .	-7.3896
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still be positive before the national match break the first interim result of his term of office - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse .	-5.9735
So , before the second premier class appearance of this season after the 2 : 0 at Benfica Lisbon , Kovac did not take exceptional steps either .	-6.0007
After the free day on Sunday , as planned , the short preparation for the second round of the preliminary match against Ajax , which had also successfully defeated Athens with 3 : 0 at the start of the season , .	-10.8670

" I don 't think this is all bad , we have to work out it again , because we don 't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes behind the scenes , " stressed the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic stadium .	-6.5459
On the seventh day of the previous season , Bavaria was already behind Dortmund with five meters , which has now taken the lead by one point .	-6.4322
And so Kimmich valued with a wink at least positive that the public debate about Bavaria ’ s supposedly invincible has now come to an end .	-6.4991
" Yes , that 's a good thing , " said the national player .	-4.5461
It is good for the league .	-3.9383

At the same time , Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB .	-3.7525
He had in sharp words denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan .	-4.2145
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay .	-2.5716
They excluded them from this society because they allowed themselves to be photographed with me in England , " Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city .	-4.3521
Frankly , as her President , I could not condemn the exclusion of our two young men , who have joined the German national team .	-5.5279
He was a member of the National League of Nations , and a member of the National League of Nations .	-13.6604
At the same time , he announced that he would face players in the future .	-3.9711
That someone says : if I win , I am German , if I lose , I am a migrant - that is not possible .	-3.8498
" I very much regret that he has such an impression , " said Grindel .	-3.6957
I have always said that we should have defended Mesut more .	-2.2117
However , he does not see any basis for the return of Özils to the national team .	-5.4537
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic , who has family roots in Cameroon , an additional integration representative is to be appointed .	-5.3497
" If one without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says , " The issue is important , we have to take care of it " , that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs , where integration has to work , " said Grindelwald .	-7.5458
Despite his criticism of himself after the World Cup and the Özil affair , he plans to run for the post of DFB president again next year .	-6.9399
" I do my job and try to do it as well as possible , " said Grindel .	-3.2875

According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics ( ZAMG ) , the snow fall line drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it is said that it can cut down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity .	-7.5432
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern mountain range , new snow can be expected above 2,000 metres with 20 to 40 centimetres .	-5.0864
On higher pass roads ( Arlberg Pass , Timmelsjoch , Bieler Höhe , Brenner Pass , Gerlospass , Felbertauern , Großglockner Hochalpenstraße ) the road conditions are therefore wintry .	-4.8139

The " green forests " , unique in Germany , have shaped the landscape of the country with a low forest level for about 200 years .	-6.0811
The tree and thicket hedges , which are up to five metres wide , are " forest substitutes " and for many animals and plants the last retreat areas .	-5.9888
As the director of the German Nature Protection Union ( NABU ) in Schleswig-Holstein , Ingo Ludwig , said , Knicks connect scattered habitats through which the exchange of organisms can still work .	-6.7530
Knicks Are Living Fences	-1.0121
The Knicks were built on the basis of a command of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766 , who reigned over Schleswig-Holstein .	-4.5340
The " living fences " were not only field limits and cattle fences ; they also supplied firewood and beams for their timber houses .	-5.3752
His name " Knick " comes from that time : by " bending " the branches the dense , interweaving boundaries could develop .	-7.2652
Today , between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea , around 45 000 kilometres of hedges provide a picture of a rich and varied landscape .	-5.6434
According to NABU , around 7000 species have now used them as a substitute for life .	-5.6722
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre of Knick and breed up to 30 pairs of birds .	-3.9381
However , its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly maintained in winter .	-4.7670
In other words , he withers into a small series of trees which , besides biodiversity , wind , wind protection , says . wind , wind , , , , , , ,	-9.3307

After the tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia talks about SITuation on the ground .	-3.1193
In an interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) , the local radical Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquake and tsunami :	-4.1968
Were you on the spot during the tsunami ?	-2.5163
No , at that time I was in Jakarta on the island of Java .	-2.8690
When the earthquakes were , my wife called me , she was in Palu .	-1.8322
When I learned of the tsunami , I immediately went back to Sulawesi .	-3.2282
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport on Palu was closed at that time .	-3.6005
What is the situation on the island now ?	-1.4851
The national government has reopened the airport so that supplies can also be flown in .	-2.9397
When I arrived , I saw the houses on the coast , all of which were completely destroyed .	-3.1375
Our office of " World Vision " has also been destroyed , but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people .	-4.4574
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now ?	-1.9311
Many have descended on surrounding hills , where they are still stuck for fear of another tsunami and earthquake , and where they have no access to water and food .	-4.8882
Some stay in front of their homes and there are still aftershocks .	-3.5478
Because many grocery stores and petrol stations are completely closed , some people steal food and petrol .	-4.5236
The public service has been completely shut down and the national government is helping out .	-2.8837
A prison has also been destroyed , some of the detainees are free and it is difficult to find them .	-4.1689
Many bodies are still lying around , many people have not yet been found and are missing .	-3.1944
How does the communication and information on the island work ?	-3.5335
At the moment we have a mobile reception , but before that did not work and we only received information via radio .	-6.1534
Many people are still looking for their children , neighbours and other people who do not know if they are living and where they are , because during the earthquakes people were not at home but , for example , on work .	-5.4778
The tsunami warning system did not work properly .	-1.6801
Do you have any information ?	-1.4983
We don 't know the reasons for this , but when the warning came , many thought " okay , not a tsunami " - and then he came .	-6.9937
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami , there was misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains .	-4.2967
Is an island like Sulawesi , located on the Pacific Ring , not prepared for earthquakes ?	-2.5800
However , every day there are earthquakes , but that was the worst .	-3.4497
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and train evacuations .	-2.7549
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed , and the earthquake has hit a great many people .	-3.4511
FC Bayern München : VfL Bochum have been awarded the Champions League title of the UEFA Champions League .	-14.8735
VfB Stuttgart will miss Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo with serious muscle injuries for a long .	-5.7178
On Saturday , the German football league announced that Aogo had taken a muscular fibrosis in the rear left thigh against Werder Bremen .	-9.5289
In Donis , the doctors diagnosed a muscle pack in the thighs .	-4.5632
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss out after the next national match break .	-6.2062
VfB Stuttgart did not issue a forecast for the sell-out period .	-5.6090
As a rule , a muscle bundle rupture heals within six to eight weeks , and a muscle fibrous rupture usually healed a little faster .	-7.3169
The triumph of hyper-realism at the San Sebástian Film Festival	-3.7504
San Sebastián - The film festival of San Sebastián concludes the annual excitement of the most prestigious European festivals .	-4.6310
Despite all the sounds on the cinema , one can sum up : 2018 was a remarkable year for the film .	-5.0773
After a convincing competition in Cannes , especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that could attract a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood , San Sebastian also gave one of its best competitions in recent years .	-5.6234
On Sunday morning , the fire brigade in Olching tried to catch a wounded duck .	-3.4723
However , the action went on for some time .	-3.4788
Even a boat was used .	-1.6188
On Sunday morning , a white injured duck was spotted by walking along Lake Olchinger .	-6.0002
It remained in the area of the water monitoring station .	-3.9504
To help the animal , the passers-by called the police and the fire brigade .	-2.8760
The first attempts to capture the duck , however , went wrong .	-2.2938
Despite the injury , she was able to evade the forces of the armed forces .	-5.8836
In the end she fled to the lake .	-2.8555
With a rescue boat , the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to the land , where it was then put into a transport box by a fireman with a bold handle after almost an hour .	-5.6712
The duck injured at the chest was then taken to the LMU animal clinic in Oberschleißheim .	-4.5463
But , according to initial estimates , their chances of survival are rather low .	-3.6328

The fourth place at Olympia was Biathlete Julian Eberhard in the stomach for a long time .	-4.5247
In the coming winter the Saalfelden wants to catch up with the lost precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund .	-4.8122
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the medal to grasp .	-4.3192
Seven tenths of seconds were missing on bronze at the end .	-2.5236
" I have deliberately given myself time to process this , " says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym Fitness Studio in his hometown of Saalfelden .	-6.8113
A medal was the goal , I was in top shape , but it just didn 't want to be .	-3.3677
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missing precious metal in the new season : " The goal can only be to return with the constitution to a major event , to win something .	-5.1889
At some point we have to strike .	-4.2460
The World Cup track in Östersund ( SWE ) is Eberhard : " The track I have already closed to the heart " , he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the last year .	-6.3432

Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited .	-3.1196
The Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a razor-thin majority for Brett Kavanaugh , the US Senate ’ s Supreme Court ’ s controversial bill of coercion , by means of investigation . , , , and .	-7.7579
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline of Friday to investigate alleged incidents more than 30 years ago .	-4.4777
The recent turn in the drama surrounding the appeal of Kavanaugh , accompanied by a cultural struggle , was triggered on Friday .	-4.4071
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor , Christine Blasey Ford , during which the lawyer stepped out of angry rants against opposition Democrats , the Senate Justice Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative Supreme US judge .	-5.7298
The Republican majority seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared , contrary to his original announcement , that he would agree , but demanded an FBI investigation .	-3.8263
After tumultuous scenes , his party friends agreed .	-2.4588
President Trump , who called Thursday ’ s severe reprimands “ Beschiss , ” initially abstained from further attacks on women and , on the contrary , spoke of “ happiness in disaster . ”	-6.2509
In this way , last doubts could be dispelled , he said .	-3.4431
Later , in an election rally , Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh : “ They are trying to block and destroy . ”	-3.5789
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh ’ s case	-3.1444
The White House has also severely limited the powers of investigators .	-2.8261

FC Schalke 04 : The fear has been felt .	-4.2166
The coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz .	-4.7162
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory in the season .	-3.9038
But Mainz also played a role against the time factor .	-4.3419
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches .	-3.7790
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05 .	-3.1954
" I have seen every ball in it .	-1.9162
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room , " said the Sports Board of Schalke 04 - and breathed .	-3.6778
After all , the royal blue had still succeeded in securing a close 1 : 0 against the Rhine bosses over time and thus the first season victory .	-6.8331
In fact , things could have been different .	-3.3078
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given security to the team of chief coach Domenico Tedesco : " In sum , the first half was good , both playful and pressing " .	-10.6256
Don ’ t Make a Headball Monster	-3.0916
" The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me , " Heidel said : " If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bank , I can understand . "	-7.1761
The guys were afraid to give this out of their hands and therefore kept on withdrawing .	-6.0090
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz .	-2.3228
To save the first three meters of the season .	-2.0302
" We all liked a huge stone from the heart , " said Schöpf , who had no insignificant share of it with his headball hit : " I 'm actually the worst headball player in the man creation " .	-8.2749
But in the end it is only victory that counts .	-3.0799
The relief was felt throughout the arena , including , of course , Tedesco .	-4.0794
" We wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make a fireworks display out of it , " said Schalke 's chief coach .	-5.3214
Victory was important .	-0.8310
Finally we can look forward to a few hours .	-3.1937
I am very , very happy for the team and the fans .	-1.4906
We have played intelligently , calmly and boldly , so we have to take over 90 minutes .	-6.0262
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon : Royal Blue missed to worry for clearer conditions .	-5.7847
The possibilities for this were finally there , for example , by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka , who met twice the Latte 59. / 72 or Amine Harit 62 .	-4.7106
" Then it would not have been a victory for quotes , " Tedesco said : " You have already felt the fear a bit " .	-6.2485
I am therefore pleased that we have won .	-1.9375
This meant that he was not the only shaker .	-4.1912
Fischbachau : Smoke column in the Leitzach Valley 2 km visible	-3.4195
The smoke was not visible .	-2.6959
From about two kilometres away , a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday at around 1.30 p.m.	-4.5441
Now the police are investigating .	-1.5231
Fischbachau - The cause was soon discovered by the police and fire brigade : an unknown man had ignited garbage on a two square meter area at the Gschändner mountain .	-7.2525

And that is close to the forest . . . . . , . , . . , ,	-5.6730
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy with pulling and deleting .	-5.1353

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration : a discussion on an equal footing	-4.7058
In front of them is the author , Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani .	-3.3053
He once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild .	-3.6509
" I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years , " explains the founder and chairman of the " Reckenfelder Treffen " - the association that cooperates with the " Kulturpolitik " alliance to organise the evening .	-6.6729
El-Mafaalani goes into reading very loosely , describes the writing process of the book , talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way .	-5.4098
With a lot of gesture , tangible figures and a certain joke , he brings one of the most conflictual subjects closer to the audience : migration and integration .	-6.4360
Why , despite successful integration , are conflicts increasingly arising ?	-3.8234
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question .	-2.8862
German society is sitting at one table , and first-generation migrants are at the cat table .	-4.9710
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table .	-2.2446
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany , they have always sat around the big table and now want to be part of the decision-making .	-4.6872
That leads to conflict .	-1.4535
It is therefore not a matter of whether one is politically right or left , but of ' Am I for or against an open society ? ' , he stresses .	-6.7728
At the beginning , we are getting more and more busy .	-7.5537
And there is talk .	-2.0250
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective , two teachers tell us how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students .	-4.2759
El-Mafaalani , not on stage , is a symbol of the discussion : it is on an equal footing .	-5.3024
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion , stresses that he talks about the average , not individual destinies .	-4.7370
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject , because ' only when we understand what the problem is , can we find solutions ' , says El-Mafaalani .	-4.2298
During the signing session he also listened to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer , where prepared Kurdish specialities were discussed intensively .	-5.9854

Building in Landsham : 100 applications for 20 plots .	-2.4477
The demand is obviously huge : more than 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the plots in Landsham-South .	-5.4702
The Municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-Süd area on the open market .	-5.6250
This is communicated by Mayor Roland Frick .	-4.2358
In addition , the application phase has been completed for the 20 plots that the community offers at more favourable conditions or prices , similar to the former housing model .	-7.3198
More than 100 applications have been received , says Frick .	-2.5413
" The documents are currently being checked " with regard to the application criteria , completeness and correctness .	-4.8660
According to the Mayor of Plienburg , the aim is to have drawn up the ranking of the 20 properties by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council .	-7.2574
Then it can be awarded .	-3.7618
In the south of Landsham , a total of 50 plots are being created for single and double houses , as well as four plots for multi-family houses with an estimated eight units each .	-7.1675
The development is now almost complete and the roads are to be paved soon .	-5.0219
A single property and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person , the rest of the community Pliening .	-5.1556
It sells the majority on the free market , 20 plots in a socially compatible model .	-4.0307
According to Frick , the community ’ s two multi-family houses are to be built as an affordable living space .	-4.6558
With a total of 16 fully subsidized , income-oriented apartments .	-5.1764
Place 200 People	-4.9719
It is highly estimated that the area of the new Landsham-Süd area will create housing for about 200 people .	-7.8283
Not only that : now , at the beginning of October , according to Frick , the start of a new nursery is being made there .	-5.8168
It is intended to accommodate three nursery and three cribs groups , as well as a room .	-5.4815
The opening is scheduled for September 2019 , at the start of the next kindergarten year .	-3.8271
As a result , Schalke 's ' Great Sport ' is also successful at the Bank .	-5.5464
For the third time in succession not in the starting eleven : Nevertheless , Naddo thanks Schalke-Rainer Domenico Tedesco .	-6.5786
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not been sitting in the Schalker Startelf for the third time in a row , but on the exchange bench , the understanding would have been great for many people if the Brazilian , who is almost two meters tall , had really felt the frustration of the soul .	-8.0474
But when Schalker players gathered in the middle after the 1 : 0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 as usual and chief coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals , the 36-year-old , who is all easy to call Naldo , turned in and said : " We have to thank , coaches ! "	-8.2968
" That was very emotional , that was great sport , " Tedesco later commented on the reaction of his vice-captains , who , despite his renewed reservist existence , had no grudges .	-7.0298
Problích knows Naldo , who was the best Schalker in the last season , that he did not actually get on a losing track with his coach - he gets a break for good reasons .	-8.0473
One reason is ' burden control ' .	-2.7749
It was not easy to tell him .	-2.0457
" It was not easy to tell him that , I say this to you in all honesty , " Tedesco said from the moment he told Naldo that he was not on the grid .	-6.4454
He is an important player , he is an important person .	-1.7010
But it 's always about the matter , it 's about the club " , Tedesco founded the step .	-5.8790
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes .	-6.2847
He is 36 years old .	-0.7803
It is important that everyone is able to run through at the moment .	-5.1432
And that we all keep in the boat " , Tedesco explained the rotation that also caught Naddo .	-5.9916
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age : by acting as an exemplary team player on the bank as well .	-4.3976
The mood in Austria ’ s industry continued to decline faster than in the eurozone in August .	-4.0565
The Purchasing Manager Index ( PMI ) was at 46.7 points at a 37-month low .	-3.6508
Despite this , Austria has the third best sentiment behind Ireland and the Netherlands , according to the Markit Institute on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies .	-5.6149
Unlike in Austria , the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points , which means that for the 13th consecutive month the index is below the 50 meter mark indicating growth .	-6.1458
The only industry in Ireland hit this threshold with 50.9 points in August .	-3.4663
Last was the Greeks ( 42.1 points ) .	-3.1182
In Germany , France , and Spain , the mood barometer fell more slowly than in previous months .	-3.9735
In Spain , the index reached the highest level since March , at 44.0 points .	-2.9736
" The slightly weakened descent may well mean that the worst has survived , " said Markit economist Rob Dobson .	-4.6639
But industry remains the number one brake on growth , at least in the third quarter .	-3.5157
There is no prospect of a rapid return to the growth zone : export orders in the eurozone have fallen as fast as they have since November 2011 .	-6.3932
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh consecutive month .	-4.7280
In China , too , industrial production fell more sharply in August than was initially thought .	-3.9520
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points .	-2.4859
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points .	-2.2602
The Purchasing Manager Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies .	-3.8477
Amongst other things , developments in sales , employment , storage and prices are being highlighted .	-4.5620
