Sendling 21 years after drawing up the map of Munich, 1877.

Houses of subsendlings are concentrated in 1856 along today ’ s Plraße, which was named after Georg Plinganser, Sebastian Planser, was named after a Bavarian farmer.
Where is the Westpark, you can see nothing more than the first glance of the first zooming: a small map with dutch numbers and numbered lines: "handnumbered pieces from the so-called" Urnum ".

Civil rights group publishes travel warnings for Missouri
The National Association for the promotion of color has issued a warning to people who are discriminated against because of the discriminatory policies of the state and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force until August 28, 2017, the American traveler and travels through special attention to the state, and to bring special attention to a number of extra-racial incidents, since a number of recent incidents in the state, and in other words, it is said to be noted in the entire group.
A recent law passed by the Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities, the state ’ s disproportionately aimed at removing the group of minorities, the ACP group said.
"They have infringements of citizens' rights.
They will be killed because of their skin color, or they are beaten, "said President of the NAACP City Chapel, Rod Kansas, the Star of the City of Chapel.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency, which we have not heard.
It is the first warning that the organization has issued a warning to the US.

The travel warning is also a new response to a new law that would make it more difficult for companies to cope with discrimination on account of housing or employment.
Previously, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) traveled to Texas and Arizona after having adopted the laws of immigration laws, which oblige the local authorities to prosecute local authorities to take the view of the fact that ACLU will contribute to the establishment of further racial hatred.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but other countries have recently been used as a reaction to certain trends and laws within the US.

Is nothing more sacred?
Now, the White House accepts Trump ’ s Freedom Party
The safest sign of a regime change is when it starts to attack it.
Americans appreciate that, as well as any other careers of Saddam Hussein ’ s overthrow Saddam Hussein ’ s firmed place in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew what he did, when he was a symbolic Axhitt in a tiny dispute with Jim Acosta on CNN's proposals to restrict immigration.
In order to remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.
A Horde of BootsLiberty-owned beekeepers would have done him if he had done it.
But it is important that it has been attributed, especially to the importance that it was attributed to Emma Lazarus of Gedicus in 1903, after 17, the and.
As Miller Acosta said: "I don't want to go into a complete story about Ding, but the statue of freedom is a symbol of American freedom.
The poem, which you refer to the original part, was not added later, and the statue of liberty.
Miller is right, but it is true, as he himself said, it is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of resonance to the words of Lazarus, which invites the only state in which a single state does not invite you to the poor, but the poor, the poor, the people of your poor, the mass of your people, the poor, the people who are free to breathe.
There has never been a time when the "waste" in our screen.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US.
This conflict is important because of a statue of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict in America.
Lazarus - friends and their friends to put their words on the basis of their death, after their death - knew very well that they had a very good political action.
The sculpture should show links between French and American Republicanism by showing them in a classic portrayal of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem is no longer abstract figure - she has received a voice.
And there is a very different name: Mother Exilators.
The connection of the poem is a brilliant image of feminist coup and an attack on Native American attack.
And exactly how Lazarus wanted to change the status status quo, people wanted to change from the wings.
The great horrors of Rush as a kind of lime, John of the Baptist, argued for the coming of 2010, that the libertarian statue of freedom rather than an early warning, but rather that the American neo-liberal flame: the world is moving forward in Flamm.
It is supposed to bear the freedom of the United States in the rest of the world.
The United States is not supposed to learn the path in the United States.
Ziemwnlich is unusual in Limbaugh.
The importance of statue is quite a question of the position and the perception of the position.
The great fantasy of Lazarus, indeed, was to see them as they were, as they had exhausted, but hopeful, hopeful and often dreadful journeys on ships.
It is in the true sense of the world to look for people from the perspective of the people who seek refuge and improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them and the hope of the words of the will to hear them.
And that is not, of course, the Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not the way to learn, but hatred, the only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black members of the Scottish team of members of the United Kingdom
Eilidh remembers Doyle a time when only two Scots were among Britain ’ s team.
The performance director of the UK lightweight kills, Neil Black, says that the 16-year-old Scottish team will make a huge contribution to the world championship.
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London on Friday 2017.
Black believes that Scotland has developed something special in the United Kingdom and the "light athletics of the UK needs to.,, and.,,,,,, and.,
"We welcome it and try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it" Black ".
"I speak with people in the Scottish Sport Institute and think it has done something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish Athletes think that it has done something to do with what it has done.
Britathletics: It has done something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type of street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant.
Several of the Scottish Athletes are medals, including Laura Muir, Laura Butter and Andrew Moir against the Mo Farah, Sir Leon Eilir, who was elected by the team during the Eilidan team.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Your speech was incredible.
"A number of athletes, regardless of whether they were still living or working, or they were very proud of.
The passion and true sense of passion, the oak was, of course, brought great.
The Commonwealth of silver medals, in which the fifth world championships in their fifth world championships.
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup in 1983, and seven were achieved in 2015.
The medium-haul runner Muir leads to this year and has drawn up two British and European records.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m.
Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m, is another Scots, one of the great championship after the season of the British Grand Prix.
Doyle recalls her first World Championships, as the only Scots McConnell team.
The Mann-Kapinin says that they are extremely proud of the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of their compatriots, but also in some cases, medals and medals.
"The Team-Kapinin" is a special feature for me to be chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour for me to know, but my colleagues voted in favour of teamwork.

It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as an established athletes, athletes who want to rise on podium.
As far as my speech is concerned?
Yes, I think they went well.
I have just pointed out that we are very happy with this situation because we are a home championship.
So it is really important to put this home support and to get back on the Olympic Games.
I get a second chance, there will be a chance to compete and compete in the atmosphere.
Blocks of Critics: Facebook about Bewirb: not a public office, if you don't have the power of constituents you may not be able to vote for the voters.
The father of our country knew something worse.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it took too long to swallow him to swallow him to swallow him to pursue his political principles.
He sent him to the criticism.
But he has not brought his critics to silence.
In 1783, Washington said: "The freedom of speech can be taken away, and stupid - and we will be stumbled to the slaughter.
This brings me to Maryland Gouverneur to Larry Hogan, who has to work more.
Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people, and their opinion on the official side of the Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union from the beginning of this week.
The Stab Gouverns of your classmates, and the online commentary as a commentary, was full of feedback from the "Na Na".
"It is just" Facebook, many people said.
But it is important.
And it is particularly important if a type like Hogan.
This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state,.
He has the second highest approval of the governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hits.
He has shown a firm hand in hand and strict compliance with the principles of the state.
He was also very sent to Facebook as a primary tool to connect to his voters and to his voters with his head.
That is why the blockage of people who come on the side of the Gouverns - is a public forum that is officially called the forum and is paid by people who are paid unnecessarily and dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker in Amelia Chauan, the governor of the Chauverns, argued that nothing more than moderation.
But it is easy to use the image of Trolls or spammers, or people who use the peer online peer.
The post spoke with some real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that is only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a parish, a troika and no troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, not thoughtful and profane.
The Pfarrer quoted the bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lawyers Lakshmi Sarani, Ramma Bowie, Mhash was not filled, but she asked for haste.
"I commented that politely was disappointed that there was no response to hatred and other news stories", "she wrote in the news section.
"I do not appreciate this idea, even if a number of people will take a position on the same subject as some of them, rather than a collective use of so-called 'collective disregard for the citizens concerned.
What the employees of Gouverns called the "Spam-focused attack" would probably call others.
The Facebook-era era simply makes it easy to cut a message by criticizing critics or negatively block a comment.
It is far too early to be cleaner than when you have done the same thing that the employees had been sent to newspapers to collect critical papers and to collect protesters and to silence demonstrators or demonstrators.
But that is precisely what is happening.
Hogan is not the first public official to criticise the fact that he has accused other social media and other imprint.
President Trump will be blocked by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this week fell into Virginia.,, and.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Louvisn County, First Amendment, the US Secretary of State Cacherry, James C. Alexandria, as a constituent facebooks of their constituents.
And in Kentucky received a visit to Gouverneur (R) also a visit to the ACLU on Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portingos had a similar impact on the Internet.
The number of newspapers published in 1776, between 1700 and 1876, and his letters swallow him to swallow his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymously.
People who wrote "Pseudonyme" Juricola "," Valerius "," Belisus "and" Portius all ", wrote letters to all newspapers that made decisions.
Petitions that were collected by the Treaty on Amity, the trade and shipwreck, with the United Kingdom, its historic position, according to George Washington Online, the Papers Project Online Papers.
But he has not brought them to silence.
Freedom of expression, disagreement and discourse belong to our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.

Currently 455,000 such noncommittal bookings, Musk Analysts in a telephone conference.
The fact that the cancellation of 12 percent of all orders could be made until now, but the Tesla-Chef does not believe., however,.,,,,,,,,,,,,
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla 84,000 vehicles.
2018 should be - all models together - 500,000, a million 2020.
The demand is obvious.

EPA-Pruitt prefers because of the Hingerns ’ reluctance to reduce emissions from Obama-Era
A day after 15 states had been reduced by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, the former chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, the decision to delay the implementation of the Smog era, to reduce emissions of atmospheric pollutants.
Pruitt presented its change as an agency that responds to the needs of the environmental authorities more quickly than before.
He did not mention the Klage which had previously been raised in a federal court.
It is a deadline for 1 October 2015, which ran out of the states to comply with the standards of Ozahon.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the year to postpone its decision to give more time to the Authority to study and to prevent local economic growth or to interfere in local decisions.
Pruitt, who was nominated by President Donald Trump from Oklahoma long time ago, was a reliable opponent of environmental protection rules.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone to block regulations, or to block chemical industry, which resist the chemical industry and fossil fuels.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for Pruitts.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal ruled in Washington that the EPA authorities tried to oversee its authority as a rule, the implementation of an oil and gas company, and the monitoring of methane oil and gas companies.
In an opinion published on Wednesday, the Pruitt proposed his opinion that Kehronsde Ozonstane would simply be willing to cooperate with the EPA ’ s complex process of meeting standards with the new states.
"Among previous administrations, EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines, and then wait for the activists and other groups to set an agreement, and to establish a date for the execution of a" EPO ", said the time that a dozen times more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation of court proceedings and we take seriously.
We also take the law and authority which gives us the authority seriously.
Nevertheless, the opinion expressed by the EPA, that at some point, its power to make use of all the other powers available to ensure that all the legal provisions are based on a 'sound policy'.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader recast.
A month in the final draft legislation is intended to delay the implementation of at least eight years by 2015.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote.
The New Yorker General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states who had the EPA, said this week in the EPA Group, said that the legal pressure that the group intends to maintain.
"The reversal of the EPA - after our Klagen is an important profit for health and safety of these millions of Americans who are directly affected by the New Yorkers, who are directly affected by the Smog Schneiderman said.
New York, California, in this case, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Oregon, Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington.
Soil Ozon, when pollutants come from cars, oil refineries, chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere.
The Smolementg can cause serious problems for people of Atemprobe, and every year thousands of deaths every year.
Representatives of public health and environmental protection complained about Pruitts.
"It is disturbing how much pressure is needed to preserve this sensible step for the protection of those responsible for the air we have received from the Lori Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump administration, and the special interests of polluters and their interests.

Fortuna Hoffmann: "Dreierkette works better".
Andre Hoffmann hopes that 2: 2 to the seasonal formation of the Swiss brewery against the optimisation of Aunschweig points.
With the first season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result that the two would not have been the result: the two countertore Braunschweig.
"The two counter-tore" and we have to be much better in Aue ", says Fortune," says Fortuna.
In the Erzgebirge, the tripartite area is also optimized.
And a gateway to get into a Fortune, which is no longer imaginative.
"For the future, it will be so that no more (apart from Michael Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also be better prepared with the experience of the tripartite tripartite.
"I do not know how we will act in Aue Friedmann says, but his trainer, Funkmann Hoffmann is certainly his cause, because we have just been able to build three positions in the semiconductor Ayelmann Kaßmann and Niko Gißmann, who said that the players can build on.
However, it is a precondition for us to be better harmonised and we do not make many mistakes.
Of course, there is also a chance to win the game.

New results of the Swedish Asylum Review
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of assessing their age age than 80, shows that 80% of those aged 18.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (Councils) has begun testing with the implementation of the tests last year.
They are supposed to make the assessment of the asylum procedure more precisely after the Swedish migration authority (after the mistakes of the migration authority), when assessing the correct age of some age was criticised.
Up to now, migration has declined 86.80 cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has released the results of 2.481 March 2017 from the mid-tests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eighty percent (2002) were judged or older than 18 years, while the Forensic Agency reported that the Medicine Agency was perhaps 18 years old.
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years old.
The tests are carried out only in cases where the person age is raised.
According to Johan Göransson from Forensic Medicine Agency, the results of the past few months.
"We do not see a big difference in statistics over the past few months," says The Local Journal.
The high proportion of cases, in which the person has been judged over 18 years, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 42 cases which suggest that the person investigated or older.
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results published in this paper, it stated that in 243 cases the person had openly said that they had 18 years old.
The method of medical evaluation, age assessment of the X-ray inspection was carried out in some cases similar to the MRT and Kniesheen of dental radiologists, then the radiologists and radiologists in some areas.
One skeptics is the Endocrine Claude Marcus Karolinska-Karolinska-Instituts whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans, whether they were usually seen sooner or later.
"I had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the measurement should be used.
The biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say it safely, we should not do it as if we could do it as a newspaper, he said.
Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, but the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of an adult is too low.
The greatest risk is that if the person is below 18% in this case, it is about 10%.

Minister of Agriculture - How do we protect ourselves from Gifteiftern, Mr Schmidt??
Germany has been discussing eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the RedResponse Network (NRD) and response.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and stamps.
On the consumer protection portal www.nungwarnun.de provide the latest information about the Federal States concerned about the charters concerned.
People affected should be returned or destroyed.
Even if, after all, we know what a health threat is virtually excluded.
Now, Aldi is the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs from the central role of the Federal Economic Area because the role of the enlightened Federal Minister for Economic Affairs is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs?
Food surveillance is the task of the Federal States.
Nevertheless, my house has been suspended without delay and acquaintance, the German authorities have been affected by the very close exchange with the authorities of Germany.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade has the same concern as the manufacturer to ensure that the products sold are healthy and unhealthy.
If the eggs are exceeded, the maximum residue content of 5mg / kg, this is not exceeded.
Unburdened eggs can be sold and sold.
This time is not the fault of farms.
Is it possible for consumers and businesses in the same boat?
According to the current knowledge of production companies, there is no direct blame.
Rather, they must be courageous because of illegal practices with economic damage.
As always, there is little Ernstfall in control.
Is there a lack of staff or staff?
It was precisely the official controls, but the process was revealed.
However, the truth is that food fraud and energy crime can never be ruled out.
It is precisely for that reason that such events and public prosecutors can manage the offences in cases where criminal offences are crucial.
I have already made it clear that I expect the responsible authorities to have a loophole.
Is the regular alarm of food scandals?
Consumers and consumers have the right to have safe and safe food.
If a non-authorised insecticides are used in the food industry, consumers are rightly disturbed.
The producers of the funds are plunged into a situation where consumers are not absolutely necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the use of the illegal insecticides in Fiil in the case of animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be consistent at all levels and work with high pressure.
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the situation is resolved quickly and unresolved.

The Bank of England has warned that economic growth is going to remain "interest rates", as they will remain in the middle of a family income.
The policymakers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) voted to keep interest rates at 0.6%, with 25% to keep interest rates in this month, with a rise in less than a weak increase in support of economic growth.
In its quarterly annual inflation report, the Bank projected growth forecast for 2017 and 1.7% for 2018%, and warned that inflation would continue to rise to pressure on household incomes, while inflation is expected to continue to rise.

A court is that this means that $316 million is owned by Colin Paul and has $176 million worth of Paul.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem.
"The Colin Colin proposed departments have left him with what I thought best for the objects he wrote in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediators, the first hearing of the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - as Mr Colin Paul, claims that he has ruled out.
Colin argued that this is not true, but Paul raises a few incompetent owners.
In an early avid affair, Colin Colavier has been filed, and I hope he will resolve the dispute.
"My Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority.
The costs are rising, in the case of hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Charter and Partners, Kemer lawyers with leading lawyers, Myers, QC, and Myers.
Mrs De Luigortis and her husband, Luigi Ebeni were Italian immigrants, and the delicacy of the late 1950s and early 1970s.
They used security to buy Collingwoody Colling-Liegenschaft in the first Colin Jeanske family.
Colin Wester said that he started there as a "High School in my last few years, when Paul was a small child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Luigi says that she died in 2012, and died in 2012, hoping that her property was handed over to her sons.
"Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to court.
Two other brothers Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the Lutis-De Coltiske, claiming that in the company ’ s $10 million and 26 million were paid.
Both Lukas Mark and Paul are saying that the conditions of their financial separation have become banished.
Colin has withheld a very long time, despite the fact that he was a former AFL member of a biografie from 2015 and after the McGuire of the television stars.
Fairfax took with Colin De Lutis and Paul De Antis.
Only in Colin responded by saying 'I cannot really say' I cannot say much because the case of the courts.
"It is very sad to say that my brother Paul decided to sue my family name, and to draw our courts' names.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote a letter to the court that he sought to meet the demands of his brother.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I said that in our current dispute, he added," he said, "he would still hope that a solution.
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts.
Trump ’ s new stable media plans to restrict media coverage.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do.
If so, he will be the first one.
Politico reports that the new stable head of the White House are planning to curtail the flow of information, including President Trump - are cutting off the news media, hoping to hold a moderate course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey: Dawsey.
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of White House, he met with his first working day, he met President Donald Trump ’ s main problem in White House, he repaired the White of,,,.
Kelly told the staff that information should flow to him or her paper on paper, because if he had better decisions, he would receive good information.
Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to monitor Trump through his media narratives.
President Trump ’ s relationship with television and back decades, where he is still in White House, his television advertising is still.
"If Trump was nominated for a fair reporting, it was annoyed that he was a productive report to show that he received a fair coverage of the former“ Nunberg, ” he said Sam Nunberg in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote that the time of Trump ’ s “Twitter-Taramni, ” under six control, according to former presidential campaign, is to ensure that media coverage includes a personal lobbying price.,,, and and,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay.
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter-habit ever under control was ridiculous.
Perhaps these Kampagnenbeamed something else, we do not know that Trump ’ s interventions without any more intervention.
We will probably never know about the Tweets sent to Trump.
If his employees have already had some time to keep his sleeves from him, then his efforts to keep his.
But no one has consistently failed to prevent Trump from controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House are competing in a White House, who repeatedly try to advance their own parties by trying to advance their own material on Trump ’ s agenda.
Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the advisers of the President, for reasons of desperate strategic information.
This was an example of the reporters described by Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond to a negative volcano like a press section with negative clicks, above all, that such disgraceful leaks and leaks come from.
This was exactly what happened in February when someone accused the President of a printed copy of a newsletter of Gotte, the Internet site of the King Charles C. Johnson, the Deputy Chief of Staff of Katschellish, who accused the whish of being a source of "whites behind a white-.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter or had no concrete evidence that he offered or she was wrong in the past.
Trump and the article began to ask about Walsh employees.
Goldmacher added that the then-Reindamf Prischeebus and White House Secretary General of the White House, Porter tried to implement a system of paper "trying to document the system, to manage and document the Trump administration.
How did this?
Kelly tried to do the same for three months later.
Perhaps he will prove more effective than Trump ’ s managers, but he is still trying to prove his impulsives, and even his advisor.
These unchanged factors make Kellys mission very difficult.

This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we will submit to our case.
From Birkenhof Luise Waldhotel Luise
The Hotel Birkenhof is located in the heart of the forest.
The house of Torudenen Freudenstadts is currently being renovated on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
Because the closure of Birkenhof Hotel Birkendamder was then lost in April 13, 2014, around 30 000 overnight stays and also lost revenues by Kurds.
In the autumn of 2014, rising dramatically, the numbers of refugees arrived in Landkreis, the hotel building was offered as a collection of controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from providing asylum seekers through the establishment of a building site.
The decision was then unavoidable at that time.
But above all Freudenstadts Julian Obermayor Osswald defended the hotel at the time, and spoke.
He should retain the right.
The Luisenhotels group with Birgit Scherer, located in Bad Birkenhof, has acquired the former seat of a voluntary auctioneer in Berlin and in a three-star hotel in Luisenhof. a in and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The group has four houses with Freudenter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergern and Bad Herrenalb.
The hotel Luise Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise now and Waldhotel Luise now.
At the earlier Hotel Birkenhof we have been working for a long time before the entrance of the building and the house is made clear.
The floors were removed from the ceiling, partly removed from the old bathtub.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
Until March, there is much to do.
"It is actually a beautiful hotel" Thomas Scherer says in the conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large shower, toilet, shower and toilet.
Anything else should be "close to the citizen, like Thomas Scherer.
"We want to make a jewel.
Swimming pool, conference room and conference facilities are available.
You do not want to stand at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but you have already a high.
The Waldhotel Luise with its 60 rooms, about 60 broad-wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers and businessmen are to feel comfortable at home.
Talks with OB Osswald and Michael Krause Tourism Director Michael Krause.
The ideas of the city are equal to those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line.
According to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to set exactly exactly.
Approximately one million euros.
The exterior plants are also visible on the front, which is already visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market.
Russ Affary: US Special intermediary jury sets a Grand Jury.
In the Russian-US affair, President Donald Trump is supposed to have a special panel of Robert Mueller ’ s so-called Grand Jury.
The Greer Wall Street Journal in recent weeks, wrote the work "Wall Street Journal" with confidence-entrusted to people.
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigation and intensified.
The CNN Sender reported that there is already a first pre-test of the Gremiem meeting between Trump ’ s son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence services have been accustomed to the Kremlin for a long time in 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller examines whether there were talks between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow.
The focus is on investigating several men who are supposed to be in the Republican election campaign.
According to Trump ’ s reports, more private and business environment, Trump ’ s business environment.
"Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special middle-class Trump personally investigated the center and allegation that President of the incident investigated whether the President of the judiciary might be obstructed.
The main task of Jurys is to examine evidence of possible crime and to decide whether to prosecute and prosecution.
The Grand Jurys also include anchors.
Most of them are outdated when they are controversial and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The body can also be switched from the Public Prosecutor's office to allow persons to be downloaded under Eid.
According to CNN, CNN stations have already been issued, the transmitter between Donald Trump and Jr.
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to say that a report was called upon to do so.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump ’ s Jr. and Trump ’ s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as his election campaign leader Paul Manafort.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening that US television should act swiftly to suspend his work, that Mueller should not be intimidated and that he should act quickly.
But it does not necessarily mean that the jury will decide on the end of a jury to decide on charges.
Nevertheless, the establishment of a new phase of Gremium at the beginning of a new phase of investigation and concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations of President Donner West on Thursday evening, Virginia Affia West Virginia as a political campaign to portray the of his political opponents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Russale story is a dead invention", said Trump.
The subject is that democrats have a chance to feel good, because they cannot talk about anything else.
His special adviser Tybb Cobb explained in an opinion, nothing of the jury.
However, they usually work in secrecy,.
The White House is in favour of any measures that promote the work of the 'special intermediaries'.
The former FBI-James Comey said three times that he did not identify the president.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed.
But Mueller was only used after Trump had been taxed.
Because of this smoke, Trump had become accustomed to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump asked him to investigate the recruitment of national security advisers at that time.
The President is under great pressure from the investigation.
After presentation of US media collects the White House against the material and its employees.
That triggered speculation about whether Trump wants to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike a special medium of independent congresses such as Waters in the Congressional Watergate affair, Richard Nixon, President Mueller Nixon, a position that he could theoretically be taxed by the President of the Justice Department.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators were dismissed on Thursday, Thursday, which could not be dismissed.
Antarctis: Gigantic Eistrecht in Antarctica.
In the West antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin ’ s iceberg.
The Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar-Institut für Meeresforschung und Wednesday.
The more than 5800 tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of Kolosibe, and now it will probably need two years to come.
It is 175 kilometres long and has a width of 50 kilometres to one of the largest iceberg in the past three decades.
There is no danger to him.
To what extent the climate change has played a role in the iceberg, it is unclear.
In total, however, there has been some 30 years since a series of unusual icebergs in the region of Eisschelbrüfen, the US research centre for snow and ice (SINDC).
According to many researchers believe that global warming could be linked to global warming.
The now closed Koloss was a part of Lars Kolos-C-Schelsenfeis.
Schelfeis floating on the sea and the large glacier.
It is therefore growing and continues to break the sea regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost to the tip of the Peninsula.
The Nörelfeises of this balance was disturbed by the wax and some years ago.
A complete chess screw is there, writes A.
It is also true that the Larsen-feit C-Scheldere is at risk, because the Kante has never withdrawn so far.
In addition, the ice plate can fall under tension and if a key part of a crusher.
The melting of melting ice and ice levels increases the sea level, because they do not swim on ice and ice so much water, even after the melting.
However, the loss of the glacier leads to the glacier sea directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.
However, the sea level may increase perhaps only in the slightest degree of observation that the British research project (Antarctica Midas).
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is almost 50 000 square kilometres with AWI-square kilometres of the Scheltcowardly Antarctic.
The transition from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick, to the front edge of the free ocean.
It breaks regularly.
"Although it is a natural natural sign and no direct link to climate change, the iceberg is now aware of a dangerous position in Ledetea," said Swansea University of Leary Swansea University.
"This is the most widely accepted since the beginning of the withdrawal of the records.
Among scientists, whether the Larsen-Adrien Schelsenfeis will be back in the long term, and perhaps perhaps Mr Luckelman said: "Our colleague Adrian Luckman said:" Our models will be less stable.
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers fall into the iceberg, climate change will not lead to the ice ice over the past few decades, but many of the Antarctic Peninsula.
This long Zipfel extends the Antarctica towards South America.
According to the research programme, British Antarctic Survey is the Antarctic Peninsula since the 1950 ’ s, 28 000 square kilometres of.
The decline in temperature increases.
The Antarctic Peninsula has passed over 50 years to around three degrees, and thus the temperature of around the world.
CDU staff will be at the reception desk.
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy posts, the CDU calls for the employers to join the employers' association.
Just before the summer break, the circle has 41 new posts in administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for Mettmann.
Now, again, 17 apprenticeships have their first working day.
The teachers appear to be very popular.
Some 620 applications were recorded for this year.
However, there is no further personnel to meet the needs and challenges.
Currently, there are Mettmann in the circle of occupying 50 posts.
Among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as general administration of the forces.
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the WUG initiative and take the initiative to., and, and.
The administration is intended to draw up a concept of 'personnel' and personnel development '.
The aim is not only short-term needs but to meet the needs of professionals, but also to counteract future-oriented.
The overall concept should be orientated to the outside, concrete measures for beginners and advanced training show a CDU and WDP.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has problems with staffing problems that were previously unknown.
Other cities and good officials and employees offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is of a 'right' competition 'by employers.
This requires a high number of employees, who are sick or older.
It is time for action, so that there are no longer vacancies.
But Klaus-Dieter people, the CDU ’ s leader, goes beyond his party ’ s joint motion.
He recently made an unobtrusive circle for a long time ago, when he questioned the cost of personnel and the rest of the parties.
People would like to see all the opportunities to leave a review of local employers' association.
"If we do not meet here in the short term, the solution should be reached with trade unions - perhaps also in the short term - in cooperation with nationals of cities.
In doing so, CDU officials and staff pay better than paying for the public service.
The salaries are currently prescribed precisely when there are more or less money, only if you change a higher level in professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces were to be set up in the face of the new provisions of the Prostitutes Act.
Last but not least, the growing number of asylum seekers have direct access to Thomas Hendelor Martin Kreisor Richter: you have little staff.
Italy exacerbates the tone of migratory rescue boats
Italy has NGOs which use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, must not continue to use them if they do not comply with new rules.
"If NGOs do not sign a code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work in an interview with Marco Min said in an interview with the Turniti.
Minni ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat to rescue the young German youth organisation whose rescue had effectively cooperated effectively with human traffickers.
The aid organisation, which has only been operating in a year since it was rejected by the Italian Public Prosecutor.
"For us and the rescue of human life remains our top priority.
"We can judge all accusations that are currently collected, only after judging all information we have collected and assessed the situation.
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the rescue of young people, Iventa, who have been monitoring since October.
It is presumed that his crew will be able to boot migrants on board, directly to the traffickers of traffickers and smugglers that can be used again.
At least one such meeting, only 1.3 miles ago, the Libyan coast took place, according to which the content of the Italian Public Prosecutor, whose content was published by the Italian media.
The occupation will be suspected of having authority over the Italian coastguard, the rescue operations in the zone and not for humanitarian reasons.
Under the code of conduct, such as Iventua, the Italian police officers, who have monitored their activities on board.
Only three NGOs involved in the search, rescue and rescue operations have been explained, are ready to comply with the code: Save Children to Malta, MOAS, and Activa Pro-Open from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary, but because they would not bring any significant changes to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign the Nobel laureate is the organisation of doctors without borders (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants who went to Italy after the rescue measures in recent weeks, in the last few weeks, that the efforts made to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and strengthening cooperation with local citizens.
"In the last few days we have started to see the light of the tunnel" Tunnels ", said.
He announced plans for further talks with libysn mayors in this month about economic initiatives and development initiatives with Chad, Mali and Niger, to reduce the number of migrants in Europe.

Not eight years old Arturo Vidal was in the debut of youth, and the debut of the Elf, who had just been chosen as the leader of the C-Elf.
Sugar sugar distribution is distributed to those who prefer to hold a lot of mourning.
So anyone who has been able to take advantage of the heritage of Lahm, a small motivation can only be used.
Kimmmmam confirmed: "This is what players want to take responsibility as a player.
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old girl of Lahm.

Eric Chaisse, expert in the field of agriculture, CRM, PAIEPM, said in Provence: "The Lavendel plant is endangered because the effects of climate change in recent years, the effects of climate change have been much less exposed to climate change.
This has impact on the life of Lavendel.

And it is much at stake.
Lavendel does not only loose for holidaymakers, but also for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: 'Instead of very long plant plants with a large number of flowers, we have developed smaller, or lack of either.
So we have fewer parts with oil.

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce meeting usually takes place in order to review their plans for the state of chaos in Sinaloa, organised crime and organised crime by civil servants.
But on this day, in their own shadow, they came together to talk about security.
It was communicated to them that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists are discussing what they are supposed to be: they should take their children with their office in 2009, with an or.
Security experts have written three words on the front side of the front of the opponent: Neutral, Neutral Zone.
They ask the reporters to propose any names - no column is necessary proof of perceptions and structures.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, suspected of being suspected of cartels, or the government of the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico dangerous.
There are no rest periods of violence, while the country is at least seven journalists who have accumulated more and more journalists: 25, at least since then President Enrique Nieto Peneto in December 2012.
Under the latter it is their publisher and inspiration from Riodocator, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico, and journalist Valdez wrote his books on a number of books in a context of violence.
His absence is deep, even though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows the word 'Justice finger' on the facade of the building.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their issues, the trauma, the nightmare, their sleep dreams, paranoia, parano.
Although a special prosecutor has been established in 2010 to deal with cases of journalists who have been working on this committee, according to the protection of journalists only two cases.
Like most of the thousands of murderers who are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they are still insisting on the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are unthinkable and now the terrain is still intact.
Without information about the murderers, justice and security, the meeting has little to say about the benefits of Ibarra.
"It is very stupid to turn my time in this workshop", says he says.
"As long as we do not know, we trust all".
On the morning of 15 May, the Valdez Riodoce office in Riociace, the capital of Culiacan.
He created only a few blocks to keep his name from Corolla, before he was forced to keep his name from Corolla.
The bulk of his car in his car and damaged him near the hotel.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two children.
rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacuan.
But on the subject of Valdez is virtually nothing.
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition in the United States, Sinaloa in January has become one of the most bloodiest battles in the country, because the political groups have been struggling to fill the vacuum.
It makes no sense that, in Sinaloa, or someone on the streets of the street or the graveyard is full of the cemetery of the two-storeys that are larger than the royal drug for many living houses.
Forget a minute for a moment that there is a state of 'calm' when there is only a cartel of control over the coastal state with its valuable trade routes and the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, who was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to murder.
First of all, there was the publication of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of a rival cartel in the Guzman ’ s war with Söhnen.
This publication may have been delayed by the sons of Gangmar, suspected each edition of the purchase of each edition as soon as they have been delivered.
The second mistake was to force Valdez not to force the decision to leave the newspaper another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave his own country.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing as milestone in the Mexican journalists.
He had long survived so long that his friends and colleagues would always be that he would be.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, who worked with five colleagues as a Riodoce to create $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without smokers to run the problem.
With the time of verdiente newspaper, the reputation for a courageous and honest reporting, and advertising.
Reporter loves, tough investigations, without fear of censorship, can publish and publish the stories of readers who were fascinated by a publication in which they could otherwise.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Cabot Moorot-Prize for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for the Protection of Journalists' courage for his courage in pursuing the persecution of the Mexican drug history.
He voluntarily admitted that he had fear.
"I want to continue living", he said JCP-award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a 'lifestyle', said in October last interview with a TV interview.
"You must take over the task you have to play as a journalist or journalist - either you play.
I do not want to ask: 'What did you have done so many deaths... why did you?
The Riodoce-Team is missing, Valdez SpaSpvogel, a port worker like the port workers, a friend who was generous and generous, with advice and advice.
You trust your routine.
He would always wear his dog.
He would always go to El Guayabo Bar, opposite the office, and always sit on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love to Routine his Ver?
His death also forced them to face up to their own assumptions about how best they can do their job and keep them alive.
"They do not like you, if women with their children, their homes, their clean shops, their start-ups and downs.
"These things were not allowed", said Bojorquez.
The result is itself in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-censorship.
His own instincts trust.
If it is wrong, it is wrong.
The sleeve is said, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that a sense of smell can be made... and then the thing is happening with Javier.
The old rules, such as Sinaloro and others do not apply in Sinaloro - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a mixture of lucrative smuggling of corrupt institutions and government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room, where the staff of Riodoce had been sold to the safety training, suddenly no mobile phone was sold.
Draußen two policemen ’ s protection against heat from 104 ° C (40 ° C) in the shadow of of.
They were commissioned by the national government to protect the Riodoce buildings in a four-storey building in a quarter of Culiace-Class.
Half in the Scherz, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policeman governor himself.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For the output of this week, Riodoce has three main stories.
There was the assassination of the former former Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposition of government spending, which focused on the home city of Gouverns.
And there has been a group that has been one of the most expensive restaurants in Culteacuertes, a block from the office of the Public Prosecutor.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it was done, so cautious that it was time to write to every town in the city: every drug traffickers know that the local authorities and drug traffickers.
A reporter from public reporters that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who was registered by the Institute of PRI (almost all the political revolution), almost all levels of political domination.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption due to high cases of corruption.
Villarreal reporter asked to write about previous incidents in this locale, including a son in El Chapal, a son of Guzman, "El Chapman".
Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez Columns were considered the best source of information about the abduction.
"Earlier we had already warned what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco", because of his body name.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources.
The office of Valdez de was dedicated to the insurrection and against journalists who protested against Morber de Morumen, because the journalists have never been expected to have anything to do with the names of activists.
Reporters Miriam Ramirez, a few signs and a sign of a demonstration at the next morning because of a further demonstration of the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state.
A verbal body was discovered and discovered by civil servants, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists have become laughed in protests by calling them "SOS Press" and "SOS Press.
This day is the director of Bojorquez Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with Gouverneur, Sinaloa day after the assassination of Valdez Sinaloulez, the authorities accused the journalists and journalists, because they told the truth.
She has asked for her to be given that her government shares her concerns again because she is worried that her objectivity is violating her objectivity.
Valdez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and government officials involved in a 'society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that he was not only killed by drug gangs, but also by politicians and security forces, and organised crime.
The media group "walls" Articulo 19 "last year has more than half of the attacks on journalists and officials.
"In Mexico, you want to stir them because you want to see the mouth of Ramirez said.
Obviously, morality has a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of the bloggers Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern state of Tampas.
Your body was found together with a note that the allegedly signed by the Zetas-Kartell: "Here I am because of my reports.
A computer keyboard and headphones separated from their head.
Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte, as in the northern state of Chihuahua after the assassination of Miroslava.
Others continue to make El Manana Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director Larors in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly directed the drug cartels with a guideline article on the title page of the title "What do you want?
Some journalists are from their home countries or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still looking for the dangers and threats.
And sometimes they will be forced to flee to the photographer, as Espinosa Rubinosa in 2015, four months after a flight from Mexico City in 2015.
For those who stay back and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be his poet, there are drug trafficking.
"Mexico is about hell, and that is why I said he said.
At midnight, eight last Friday, when the last edition was finished, the editors of Redodoce Riodoce's office, and the mayor of beer, when all their telephone numbers began to start their telephone calls.
A series of sliders with rivals and security forces in the vicinity of the Mazatlan Bathrooms left behind 19 dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a number of cartels in the region.
From Bordstein's edge, they have published the news on the Riodoce mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed on the next day.
Sirheulten in the vicinity of Schiefoundry - another area in the area.
Bojorquez warf a view on the policeman, who held guard to see whether they were willing to see them.
If they were afraid, they did not show them.
Among the huge portraits of the green paper, the newspaper of the middle finger, the Sinaloa, was invisible for the staff of Riodoce.
"As you can only think of it," said Bojorquez, when the same day was murdered on the same day, Javier Boquez, who asked me to send them to the street reporting on the street.
Dinosauer used Tarrium to soften his enemies to soften his enemies.
At first glance it looks like a statue, even if a deterrent.
Now, researchers found that the first findings of the incredible nose of a Canadian mountain workers have been given so well described as "Mona Lisa Mona".
It was so good that they could even find that their skin could have had their gloves from a Roman brown, and they said something of a "troubled".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" called it "as the bestpreserved Dinosaur", which has ever been found, and one of the best copies of the world.
The Fossil is a newly discovered Art Nosaurier who lived in the middle of the chalk period between 112 million and 110 million years ago.
His incredible state of affairs, researchers described it as "really" remarkably "verbal poultry.
According to reports in Geographic National Geographic is the best plant species of Fossil Fossil.
It was found by Shawn Funk, on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine Fort, near Murray, Alberta McMille, Canada.
He met something which seemed to be wrong from the rocks, and seemed to be more precise.
The Fossil discovered the Royal Fossil in Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years in order to cover the wild animals (2,500 pounds).
After all this hard work, the result is now ready to be filled.
"If you only have a little blink with the eyes, you might believe that it has been the main author, said" Callaeb Brown, the Royal scientist Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is.
"It will be one of the most beautiful science history and the best preserved dinosauries - the Mona Lisa Dinosauria.
Researchers found that this plant fresco, even though he was covered with a armor and is probably similar to a panzer of meat.
The much-vaunted Dinosauer used a red and white tart, to hide from Tarbnosau,, and.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This could have been better allowed to interfere in his surroundings and say to his enemies, experts suggest that what was threatened by Dinosaunosaur.
The 110 million old creature from Nosaurider family has made headlines for the first time in May, and now the of the Royal Palaeontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and Borealota marker after the Museumsmarkli Mitchell, a team of Mark, who spent more than 7,000 hours in a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours.
The astonishing preservation of the Mitchell team enabled Dr. and an international team of scientists and scientists to document the form of armor and armor of his body.
You discovered the Konterschatting, a widely used defense method, which means that the creature was the tip of darker than its dark side.
Although the Konterschatting is customary, the results are surprising, since Borealota's size is far from living animals.
It suggests that Dinosaunosaurier has enough pressure from divorce to divorce from evolution that he was favoured by the evolution of coexistence as a means of confrontation.
But most contemporary animals, who use Konterschatti - think of rehabilitation - you think of Zebras or belts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than those of Noute, which was criminalized in this fight.
"Starkes Raub-behavior behavior on a massive scale, Dinosaur show how dangerous Dinosaur said that the smokers had to be.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skin shows that the skin was brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal about his life, including his conservative Darmines, to find out what he has eaten.
They believe that Dinosauer died in the sea, when he died in a river and went beyond the sea.
At this time, Alberta was so warm and florida, and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today.
"This Nosaurier is really remarkable because he has been completely covered with conserved skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions, and the original form of animal welfare.
"The result is that the animal is almost as fast as today in the early chalk.
You do not need much imagination to use it to reconstruct it.
The chalk time was a huge time when the thermostat, the divorce dinosaunas, two legs on the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus, Rex millions of years after Borealota lived, the king of Dinosaur, he was buried by some of his ancestors.
This includes Acrosaurus canthorus, a long foot (11,5 m), six tons of monsters.
Scientists whose latest findings are published in the journal biology show that Bormiealota, believe that the sea in the hose and death in the mud.
The creature was found in Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Fort Mine, near Murray, Alberta McMillenia, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved Dinosaur of the world, including armor and armor, the skin is completely complete.
The creatures were on average (about 18 meters long) and up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two customs officers for a long time.
Researchers believe that the poured plant species were flooded by Canada, which was flooded until the sea.
But the underwater dilution of the Dinosaur ’ s armor, in exquisite detail.
The remaining survivors of this special remnants are so good that the skin remains so good that the panzers are still covered by panzernosaur along the Dino.,,,.
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is rarely a profit.
The more I see it, the more confusing.
Versteinerte residual skin of the skin still cover the panzers that.
His rightful front is on his side, five fingers are upwards.
I can count on the rogue of his socks.

Deutsche Bahn: "Comfort Check-in" Comfort Check-in ".
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever seen: nothing has happened in the train and is sitting in the train.

And you have to book an online ticket, which is already available for most passengers.
It must also be purchased via the App train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to get the ticket.

If the ticket is accompanied by the ticket controller, he knows that a seat there is already a passenger with an online ticket value.
So you can continue to sleep, not to mention.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for customers who use a train for the passengers - which is to use.
"If you want to travel through our ticket control staff, you can check in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time in the train, says Michael Peterson, "says Michael Peterson, CEO of DB Fernando.

For often, even in any case you have travelled, but not all documents that are not required to devaluation of online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card, otherwise you will have to reject the document.
The result is endless discussions between train and passenger attendance, which leads to bad mood or worse off at the end of the day and the control of the tickets and other delays that occur at the end of the time.

In another video, she said, she was a safe policeman and other guns: "I will kill you all animals..." I will kill you.
"This is not customary, reminding itself of the Ferran statement.
"This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to and we can call the typical '.
I felt at this moment.
I was angry and soft.
You book a return flight and went home on to the next day.
After the landing of her father, she decided to leave her home from the 6-year-old father and daughter decided to go to Ferguson.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film "Streets", in the "Streets" ".

"I had no experience in organizing.
It has come all '.
A few weeks later, during a demonstration of Sabah FerraFolayure, co-director of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Farrar Alvaro only wanted to document what happened.
A question came to mind in the Ferrell: 'Do you want to document or try to find a history that you can use it?
This scepticism has been fuelled by countless people, often nourished by a White Community, who benefited from their resilience and pain.
As Folayan interview recently stated in an interview: "We heard that people were born in Ferguson and did not want to grow their voices, and we did not want to make it different.
Folayan had already cooperated with the director of Damon Davis, an artist who worked with his field of death for activism.
His commitment brought the Ferrell project closer together with six other locals?
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us.
"This was the main cause for me, as these people are portrayed.
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell ’ s experience - to show that it is not a movement of Messiah, but to show a leader who is a community of Folias-Folies, said.
As a result, the documents show 'Whose Streets' personal life?
"I felt like" naked, "said Ferrell and laugh, when she saw the product as the first time.
"But I understood that there must be a certain amount of work in this black human being.
In addition, Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of women in Blackves-Livester-motion motion Matter-.
Two of the founders of the movement, after the black Teenagers of the Black Teenagers Martin Trader in 2012 "Blacklivesul Matlivesul", marked by social media.
"Schwarze, women in positions of leadership have borne the whole movement", said Ferrell, and we are constantly fighting for various fronts.
Black, pregnant women must bear the brunt of the main school.
Folayan voted to note that the black movement of women is really being kept alive and black women.
However, you insist that this is not a "affirmative type of action", because of its identity has been chosen as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who said this energy.
"It is no coincidence, even though it was a frontline because it was a life of this crucified black woman.
You can feel your energy through the screen.
Meanwhile, the news cameras have disappeared in Ferguson, but the police and the community continue to exist between the police and the police.
Ferrell is on the single currency for 2 ½ years for a block demonstration.
It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she feels she has a duty to remember and since she has been committed to this three years ago in Ferguson's., and.
"It is our duty to fight for freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must support each other and love.
We have nothing to lose - except our chain.
From "dream" up to "discuss the magnitude: TV Galerie Bit-readers over Bit-Gallery.
The Bit-Gallery moves people, although it is not yet built.
But the idea of a central shopping zone on the south side of the pedestrian zone since 2009, the first adversaries and supporters of the population.
Kalt can hardly be a subject.
Also on our facebook-S page "Volksfreund Bitburg" will be discussed "" ".
While the "Bit-Gallery" say: The dream would be a dream ("Becker) or" The Becker "(Nicole) is coming from the other side:" The Siggi "(no man" ").
While supporters are building a gallery that attracts more customers in the city, the rest of the business, the opponents fear that pedestrians will benefit.
In addition, the gallery is planned on the plot, the farmhouse will be marketed on the 13 direct market.
At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.
The Galerie-Macher wants to integrate a market hall in Neubau - and to integrate with the possibility of integrating the seating outside.
Simone room: "We have been buying for almost a week in many years.
Our main smile, but also the delicious cakes of the cheeses.
We have also discovered metz for us.
We would also like to see that during the construction and, above all, there is a chance to maintain this offer.
In other cities, there are also.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting.
Gerd Densing: "Whether it is marketed in a market hall in a gallery, the amount of rental.
However, the new project should not be too low.
Eva Kilic: "Wopalaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothes, shoes, shoes, supermarkets or supermarkets are superfluous.
There is already enough of our city in this city.
It looks like a lot of shops, but here he has been empty for several months.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that we get the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there is a lot of freshly sold directly from producers and is worth it.
As you see, Ladengeschengeschäfte shopping centre is only one of the larger companies, because the tenants are often unquestionable for retailers.
It is a pity that there are almost no more and more of what is left of it, then it will disappear.
Wolf Fandel: A shopping centre with a market fit for me.
And the gallery does not fit for Bitburg.
In particular, where is the farmer's market hall is supposed to be?.,,, and,.,,,,,,,
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the duration of Bit gallery is actually coming.
Or does it create the Gespen-Bitburg Gallery before, all shops from Bitburg?
George Marquet: "This will not work.
And a Shopping-Center, which no one needs it needs.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a proper farm market, rather than promoting this gallery.
But for a farm hall with a lot of pointless thanks to the madness of many - as I find it pointless construction projects in Bitburg.,,,,,,.,,,,,,
If the farmer's market chapel will disappear again.
A similar similarity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea DNA with Chelsea Mannings.
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many white faces - black and white, almost the same brown cod.
The 30 Portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wang Tulsea and her hair cut.
Manning schicking the Fort Leaks from prison, where former Leavenworth analyzing former secret services investigated a 35-year-old prison sentence, she had to be classified as a secret diplomatic site.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called Becoming A Resemblance (similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-borg Hagborg, whose expertise in science, technology, art and computer science, and transplantation, a dissident condemnation of Barack Obama, whose sentencing was converted to three days, only three days.
Dewey-borg Hagborg has created the analysis of algorithmic DNA, which has been extracted from the Porting and 30 portraits of this data could look like someone with these data, even if it does not only look like a comment of intellectual formality - not only of the DNA of many interpretations - can be interpreted as harshest and hardening of this identity, but also to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Manning, who was born as Edward Bradley, but has already been openly condemned since 2013 as a woman who has been sentenced for more than 20 offences, including six offences against computer fraud and theft.
By prison, the image was suppressed, it was only a single photograph - a black and white grains, a black and white man who sits in a man sits on the., he of.
In 2015, Dewey-borg Hagborg ’ s great success in the 12-2012-2015 project.
In this, the artist portraits of portraits of strangers from graphic artifacts such as cigarettes and cigarette chewing gum, DNA extracted from the rubber-stamped DNA, which could look like this.
This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"She said an interview with Chelsea, while she was in prison, she wanted to accompany a kind of portrait in this article," Dewey-borg Hagborg.
And she was unable to attend this time and she could not be photographed, so she could contact with Chelsea and asked whether she wanted to make a portrait of DNA.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse have been imprisoned in two letters which have been sent over the course of two years.
They even created a shoe of Shoungo illustrated Kanilio Comic Suppressed Images, a future of the Chelsea, which would be able to convert President Chelsea ’ s decision to see them personally.
The fact that only a few days after Obama published the book was released, after seven years of brutal military prisons in a Kansas, would demand a kind of happy coincidence.
There is also now an exhibition of the opening of the Starkes and Starda Donald Trump, a war against informants from the Trans-Seetweeter camp, which leads to new ways to resolve the divisions that could actually be resolved.
When Dewey-borg Hagborg was asked by Timing all these things, they said that they would happen.
In a wall on the wall of the art written statement of the artist called for a great man (including her signature "in her family name") is a heart of the "automatic fragmentation of sex, race, gender, race and culture.
On the wall, the opposite is its ochondrial DNA sequences - a thousand and thousands of CGs and lead.
Dewey-borg Hagborg, the involvement of the 200 letters (or nuotiotide Lexon) in scientific terms, the artist's highly developed biologically, at least in a similar way, we are all astonishing.
"What I hope will take care of people who are not going to take care of our genetic data and how we are open to interpretation and how to interpret it as" subjective ", said," Dewey-borg Hagborg, whose work is also to be seen in 2007.
"DNA-data can tell many different stories, so the stories are" 30 ".
The last piece in the exhibition, which is preserved in an own space, is a site of the Comic Novelle mentioned.
She shows how she speaks with a free hand phone in the United States.
"If you have won your speech, then it says".
"So never stop the mouth.
"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist "Philadelphia, who greet.
"I get always complained about it.
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition itself - as predicted in the comic book - but it should be taken away - if it is taken away from the middle of the masks, it will be welcomed by the center of the simulation, as in its own Protestant hormones.
This was also targeted at how everything was written in the exhibition, up to 5 (2), 5 Mannings, which were written in Hagenetic groups.
"In the past, I had she wanted to wall, but I wanted to ask that a crowd like" Dewey-feelings ", said Hagborg Portborg.
"I wanted that it was like a mass movement, like Chelsea, that the movement with the Chelsea movement, was also behind their liberation.

Create a comic castle: A history of England in the history of England
In his recent past, the small Scotney Castle in a Squeeze-music video and Margaret Thatcher was in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced a turbulent history of its cosy Bewl River in Kent Valley, and now has become a Roman inspiration for Jamie Rhodes.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwritten signature of someone who has been dead for over 300 years., and.
"What a personal relationship", in my letter to my hand.
'A Castle in England, which dates back to the Middle Ages, was documented by Edward Edward, who lived in England.
It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: He wrote Dead Men's Tes' Other Stories', a collection of documents inspired by the British Library - a project that was unexpected. and., he and.
"I have only responded to the Daumenabpressure on one side of the letters of a double agent that was written in 1700-1700-year-old Jakobiner.
"That is his thumb!
And stamps always smell after smokers, because of the fire of the lights.
For someone who lives 300 years later, Geruch has a effect as if he had a effect.
Ach, I love Archive!
For someone who has been beaten with old papers, he has supported him by the National Trust Council of England, and almost four months in order to be honest: "I lived in a little welcome:" I think this is a little overvalued).
Rhodos spent his days exploring the castle, the new "Victorian Archive" and discover the treasures of the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as Hymonosiosities, the walls of the bottles and the tomb of the bottles that had spent centuries.
He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked to the landscape, sometimes with artists, and sometimes with the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he began to write whiskey and began writing ".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since 2006, when the National Trust received the full access to Hussey, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes entered a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, so that the hundreds of years ago, when Aristocrats said "Oh aristocrats".

Jungs, all things are going on!
Some of the stories used in the castle as a starting point for the broader history of English, including the British Labourers, the 'The Man', a man who is relaunching the castle of 1381.
"There is an uprising of a record of 1380, in which the castle entered in this book, with the title" Knights of Kent and Sussex ".
"The farmhouse started in this area and I thought it was a good start.
Perhaps the two interconnected?
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like The Priest '- The Jesuit, the story of the Jesuit family, who tells the story of the seven years of the English Reformation.
Or the 'Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted in the 18th century, his own insultina ().
The Darrells are Rhodes ’ favorite family of Scotney: "The Gauls almost always have to spend their money again, and spend money on things that they could not afford.
Other generations of men called Darrell-Men ’ s debt crises by giving me a rich old woman to me - I see them as a bunch of talents, with a bunch of talents.

The rise of sex robot is real, and we should worry about.
It is precisely when you thought that it is not yet possible to turn a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex-robots are now a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) published a report on the development of FRR robotics in the next five years.
According to Noel Sharitel, Professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its breast and the type of fingergel.
"The people are making them more funny, but they will deliver a lot of them, and we will see them more often, Mr Sharkey said in his new report.
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their partners to a robot with a silicone cone that develops warm, sensitive to human intelligence.
The user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions and choose everything from the eye color of the eye color of the robot of the breast or the type of fingernails.
But it will be even more worrying because many people have "robots who have a progressive step-by-step.
Modern sex puppies have evolved into a robot with silicone.
The Realix-robots allows users to adapt their robots, for example, to find the characteristics of robots that they can find in more detail.
And then there are still the True Companion of Roxion's Gold Sexter Companion with programmed personalities such as "Frigid Fargid", which gives the impression of "Wild" and "with a Wendy".
"RoxxxGold has a personality that can be adapted to your personality as well as the Swabian Companion website.
You may not like what you like, and it may not, what you like.
She has also played a role in the course of the day - as people.,,, and.,, and.,,,,,,,
It can be tireless to be fixed or converting it into "mood"!
There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they are real human relations - but the degrading properties of female genital mutilation, rape, which means that if you are on a rape (Frigid).
On his website, True Companion Roxion Vibraxtor, but for men.
"If women (sic) have a Vibrator, why cannot men have a Roxxxsic website?
However, these sex robots are not just a fat or another sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing refinement in darkness, something more and more deep in our culture, an ideal retreat from gender equality to gender equality.
Most men will, of course, do not hold a robot, while the rising popularity of FRR, they remain curiously on the verge of consumption culture.
But what can be learned from the peripheral zones, in relation to the spirit of time, we are living in very rich.
And many people are not curious or strange, until they have permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sexes are highly developed in a robot in the developed world, which is threatening women's rights in the White House, in which there is a threat to women's rights.
The most alarming aspect of the television series' The Handmaid Tale '(' The Mage Report ') is not the images of the graphic images that are cast out and the eyes of the body, but how realistic it works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but it does not feel like a big jump.
The objective of these sex-robots is to create a physical similarity to women as realistic as possible (even if possible) with porn (pornographic).
Their builders want them to feel that they are inhumane.
But, on the point, when it comes to 'personalities', 'robots are not real women.
They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.
They have no mediation or background history, something that might hinder independence or anything that might disturb the imagination.
In other words, you are counterfeit slaves.

Trump ’ s performance?
He makes Mitt Romney ’ s concept of healthy human dignity.
It has become a binary trump card of the Trump era that spheres have become polarized to the US electorate.
Around Christmas and Erntekdantek there were newspapers in the US with the horror stories about how Trump should deal with the horror of relatives.
We are all supposed to be bladder to let our filter bubbles.
Less have been noticed, Trump ’ s families.
I mention this because my cousine, a left-wing poet, who lives in Chicago and lives for a long time with the Republicans of our family in New York this week.
She reminded me that the unity of a common enemy can have a powerful enemy.
With Trump in the White House, everyone knows it, including Republican relatives, who fought for decades, had fought for decades with politics, and suddenly on the same side.
I am sure that this is a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that entails considerable risks.
The Left has been strengthened by Trump, but the effect of his presidency has strengthened us all to postpone the right.
If we talk about "normalization and Trump, we refer to the possibility of selgruent powers to us that one day will no longer be able to get away.
But there is still a frightening long-term deterrence in Trump, Republicans of the right-wing “normalized ” who suddenly appear to be“ inconsistent with his income.
I find myself today's active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's version of the Romney's Verdakom - the Hund Autodach - 14% of the income tax, but at least as we knew his tax declaration (both of tax).
If Trump is to be the next candidate, the Republicans must be healthy only to improve their mental health as an unexpected improvement.
When my cousine was in the city, we brought our children to the Carousel Central Park, the largest carousel of New York, the three largest parks in the city, and if you don't spend a night in Koffman's.,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The horses are huge, the Fiberg-laser-Designs on the central cylinder - all clans are scarce and the animals are looking to look at their own shoulders, to look at their own extreme climate-friendly music.
So many clichés of a city: The views of the high buildings will be entrusted to Skylines, to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be..
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely out of the Swiss Cottage, when I found that Swiss Pub Cottage is not a Swiss Pub - Cottage is one of the most important topics in the North of London, but rather a large circle in North London.
The Central Park-Karl is still a strange but strange experience here, as two years of experience, two women aged 11-40 and 40 years old.
If I had the carousel, I could have given him the full score, but nobody was lucky enough.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my experience with a "transaction on a scale of five stars to a credit card before I was able to assess.
In the cafe from the corner of my street, it is the same option, with an evaluation of 15% of drinking money - this is something about buying.
This does not only lead to a slowdown, which should actually be a neutral exchange, but should also bring pressure to bear on the personality of the server.
The poor woman in the House of Kaufhaus, grinsend, while I was tired of my experience with five stars.

Software Update for Diesel-Fahrzeuge: What those affected must now know now.
What exactly is the software update instead?
Do you need to take part in the Diesel Action?
The most important questions and answers.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler and Opel VW Group have offered a total of 5.3 million cars.
They are supposed to improve the emission classes of cars and 5 euros in part.
Euro 4-Diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin Club of ACE Europe gives you an invaluable experience: invaluable.
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have previously been made by Schummelsoja, Smetanin says.
Deren Nacharmament has ordered the power station (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the next few months, but no precise date.
Daimler informed everyone affected.
If an inspection is already due, it will be done within the framework of the inspection.
How long will the disarmament equipment?
"Sword to say" Smetanin says.
This is a commitment from the manufacturer and political pressure.
"For we have seen voluntarily, the car manufacturers do not act on the environment.
How long should the update?
The rearmament itself could take place in three hours.
Time can be more expensive.
What are the car drivers, not a BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW Group?
The ACE is waiting for Abe.
Vermutlich would prefer foreign manufacturers, so Smetanin.
Is now a massive drop in prices?
The ACE is afraid.
But in the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there is no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE is still waiting for sale.

We make the city life worth living.
Roland Wacker Haslachs, Stadtbaumeister, is the next year.
The job has already been posted - suitable applicants, but are rar..
Since 31 years, Wacker City has been the mayor.
And the work he still gives him great fun in the press interview.
He reports about the varied, but also challenging tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, it is no wonder that the application profile required.
The city is looking for a possible moment or architect.
In this way, consideration should be given to regular notice of termination periods of time.
As Haslach for the Administrative Community as a subordination authority, the applicant must assign the relevant qualifications.
Because this function wants to keep the city at least.
If they were not able to fill out these citizens, they would have to travel to Offenburg.,,,,,, and.
But proximity to the city itself and tells him that it is important to a good climate of good operating climate and good mood between citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated considerable pride on the Wacker.
"We make the city worth life", he is sure about the building and its staff.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla-Area-platenplatz and Niederhofplatenozes.
The cingbridge between Bollenbach and Steinbach will also be renewed, which is still the subject of renovation.
The latter alone will make about 1.5 million euros if we propose to make the book 'Wacker'.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun.
There is a great deal of room for urban development.
With Haslachs, Bauhof and Gärtnerei can be reacted flexibly.
"One can move much", so Wacker, and the design of greenery, often mentioned by citizens.
Since the old town is under construction, monument protection, it is important to have an eye on what is "reinforcement", when new buildings are approved.
In any case, the city mayor bears a high responsibility.
He is here "Bauherr" at the end of my table.
For years, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau), has been working for ten years, since he has been working for 15 years.
It is true that his successor, Wacker wishes: 'We are looking for someone who really want to stay with us.
For continuity, it is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the design of the city.

Bicycle tours on southern routes:
According to the police, the perpetrators of the blue valleys of the cybernetic area of Leobener (B116), on the road (B116).
These were severely damaged, so that the seamless freight transport had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male dancers and have been looking for night hours.
Near the Tatrosare were a witnesses and a roller bike.
"This goes far beyond Lausbubenstbub", said Christoph ÖBB-Sher.
The or the perpetrators could have brought great danger to themselves and jeopardise transport.
In addition to the damage to the locale and the plant and the costs of rail transport and the costs of rail transport could also be linked to the railway stations.
Overall, it should be said that the sum of money is spent.
The damage was fixed on Friday afternoon, the railway line was fixed on the southern track without disabilities.
Approximately ten people were excluded from this morning.
But freight trains did not fall.
According to ÖBB-Sher, Christoph Posch had to be exchanged around 200 meters.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help (IBD), abbreviation (Darlindern).
Red meat and chocolate can sound your digestive system like a nightmare.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that could be rich in proteins and dairy products is a symptomatic disease that could alleviate symptoms.
The unholy state of the United States, around 1.3 million in Great Britain, and 300,000, causes Mage and recurring fatigue, or recurring fatigue.
While those affected are usually fed up with milk and milk products, their symptoms have been found to help alleviate the symptoms of the University of Washingtonic acid.
The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immunization cells in Darroum to ensure that malicious eating microbes are not hidden in food.
Cells that are capable of inflammation, inflammation of cells, which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissue.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory disease.
In experiments, an experiment was found that a kind of immunization in mice, mice found that a particular bacterium in their presence.
And the bacterium requires a tophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to solve the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a connection between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus bacteria - a normal part of the microbiomulation and development of microbiomulation, which is produced by a population of tolerance.
The more tophan Tryptophan had more food in their immune cells.
He suggested that the combination of L. Trypreuteri and a rich diet tolerant, less rich nutritional supplements, even if the system promotes the same human beings.
The PostdoktorAndean Luisa Luvana Cervantes investigated a kind of immunization that promotes tolerance as a group of cells, but it was found that such a group of cells, a group of other cells, but it was not separated.
They suspect that the difference with the mice of mice had to do with the mice - the Community of bacteria, viruses and fungi usually live in the stomach.
The demons of mice were found in DNA sequentially and six types of bacteria, which were found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them.
Moravia was born in a sterile environment, so that they had a lack of immunization and immunization, and they did not receive immune cells.
To understand how bacteria evolved into immunization system, the immune system, researchers discovered the fluid in a liquid and fluid, then the small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - the immunization of immune.
The immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
As an active component of liquid liquids, it has been cleaned, as a by-product of metabolism as a by-product of metabolism, which is known.
If researchers doubled the amount of tophan feed in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50%, but when the number of cells were halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that the same people tolerate the same cells as most of us, and that most of us have supported us in our diary.
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products derived from correuteri in cells like humans, but in humans, such as malignant genes have been found in mutagens.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells are inflammation on the surface of the inner surface.
Potentiell can lead to a high topreuteri of L. Population in this presence.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic Genie is committed to a "genius".
In Manchester United, Nemanja has signed a "Genie", "said Jose Mourinho, after midnight, after the midnight of the debut.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last Tuesday, before the final victory of the UEFA SuperCup, before the Real Madrid Cup starts on Tuesday and Saturday, as Paul Pereira and Andreas Pogmarch.
However, Matic was excluded from the preparation of the Asia-Tournee Blues and Mourinho only 45 minutes before the start of the season.
"He needs time, but his experience, genius, a kind of genius, he thinks of football," said football ".
"We will help him sooner than later.
In addition to Matic Victor Lindelu Romelkau and Lukaku in Avivaho Stadium, Avirinho will be the start of the season.
The Independent Independent in this week revealed that three other Mourinho had three further commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a fantastic job.
"Three of four to get to the club, I would like to thank the" he added.
"I will be happy if they have given me four for four, but they get great trouble.

The whole thing was a new test for engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising.

New Tief Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem.
As the wind turns out, the Sigmar Gabriel SPD-SPD leader, was always concerned about democratic elections.
It is not a disorder from the central bloc, not just a backwind from the Bund - the most important election campaign.
Since Martin Schulz has changed radically.
Since then, the employees are watching the Willy-Brandt-Haus with the growing SPD events in the provincial capital.
What Schulz has been described there since the beginning of the year, it would not be a counter-approach.
They were depths.
And that is true.
The Bundes-CDU looks surprising after the end of the Green majority at the end of the Green Lower Saxony.
"This shows once more: Green Rot cannot simply govern", said Peter CDU Secretary General of the Tauber RedNetwork (Germany).
The astonishing fraction of an Australian Prime Minister Stephan has plunged the government (SPD) because a serious crisis.
Five months before the country ’ s election lost its green coalition, so that its opposition majority would vote in favour of the CDU and FDP.
The founding leader Michael Kellen-sner, who has dismissed the Anglo-Saxon Green Twen-Elke to return to her mandate.
The CDU is entering into a clear decay of the electorate.
Elke Twsten must immediately give her mandate, "said the federal leader of the Green Group and the Greens / European Free Alliance (RND) network.
"That must not be true, but it is not true that SPD campaigners are fighting for free elections on Friday morning.
Stephan Because SPD, Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, the green leader of the Green Twelve CDU is one of the most independent government without a majority.
It is the culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regions.
And nobody knows what next.
Misere started with the unexpected defeat of Saarland in March.
A blue eye, no longer reassured.
After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westfalen will be everything else.
That was also evident - and everything was worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumelite Dusseldorf party.
Must be obedient in Genossen in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had the courage of the new G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him, the next setback.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last weekend of the SPD, lost his head at that weekend, because he called Nimbus Elphilharmonie, while his.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And because he made the crisis communication quite wrong, everything was wrong.
Since then, Scholz is struggling to survive.
So now, Stephan Because.
Because of the VW Abaffaffe and his role in the supervisory board of the Anglo-Saxon Prime Minister VW since his criticism.
Miese was added in question.
Nevertheless, or perhaps, precisely because, in recent weeks, tried to put greater emphasis on the covenant.
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover, who remained in power in Berlin, did not remain in the context of Martin Schulz.
They left him because they promised a stabilization of the party.
On the contrary, the exact opposite could happen.
It is true that the internal dispute between the Greens and the Anglo-Saxon parties is not responsible.
And Schulz is not already.
It is sometimes difficult to keep the genes closed.
Your anger is directed at the Greens, and above all, here in particular, the Members of Parliament.
"It is intolerable and democratic, as Mrs Twigteresch, her own careers about the interests of all others, says Matthias Miesch, the head of the SPD party leader in the German Bundestag (SPD) () (N) () (NRD).
Mrs Twsten is not because of her direct candidate, but rather as a member of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance has been elected to the Anglo-Saxon Member States.
The logical consequence would be that it would withdraw its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, the SPD head of the Bundestag, a "undemocratic maneuver".
"The electorate wanted four years ago was clear:" Because the Prime Minister Stephan said: "Because Opsihan says permanent SPD, the Anglo-Saxon SPD as a candidate in the Bundestag.
"Well, the personal careers of the future CDU-CDU Members said that the election results".
He called for the background to clarify the background.
I want to know whether there has been more or more far-reaching commitments from the CDU.

The mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of the town of STEC on Wednesday.
At the beginning of the information event, there was still a sliding look back at what happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas.
At that time, in 1991, Sann-Württemberg, which took over two thirds of Baden-Württemberg, took over two thirds of the total amount of., and,,,,,,, and.
In 2005, Sano II was still up to 60% of the grant in 2016.
For Schindler, the Sanndler is a success project - it is also important to promote internal development, and not only new construction areas.
On 4 April, you will receive a lecture from the state of Karlsruhe that there will be a III.,, and.,,,,,.,,,,
The amount of EUR 833 8333 000 of them, of which the rest of the country, the rest of the community.
How is a SanSano?
You will continue to investigate the slider, where the houses are really "old houses".
However, there is also a role to play in the planned area in the interest of existing ones.
If necessary, the area could be moved again.
The STEC Treaty on Mittwochay Keller, Martin Gaby, Pietzah and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the Bund program changed the "Social City", which would then be carried out within the framework of the Sans.
The core of the programme are revitalisation of urban housing, improving living and working conditions and maintaining infrastructure.
The measures would be taken in relation to the object per plot.
The remediation would then be defined as a Satan.
The grudging period for the funding period expires from 1 January to 30 April 2017.
However, until September of this year, only once again, the inventory will be carried out within the framework of those involved in the recovery area.
In November or December, the Satzungsdecision should be taken in order to be able to begin with the next year.
Pietzschmann explained that every commune had to carry out investigations.
It is a question of assessing urban residues and to decide when and to what extent and when.
It will also be registered for the respective site of Sanvera.
Pietzschmann himself will be able to come and come to a picture of the situation.
Gotzel emphasized a significant success factor in the project.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the end of the coming weeks and months after the end of the summer.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building" building and land ", among other things.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing" can be divided into details, size, and residents.
The blue operation "bogen" is only when filling rooms are operated in buildings.
However, it is important to note that Gotzel pointed out that a questionnaire does not apply at the same time.
Moreover, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler emphasized that the distribution of subsidies still work according to the principle of 'windhund', first of all, who comes first.
You cannot reserve any funding for the money later.
To conclude, photos of the project "local center" has been shown in order to make the restoration of the "sank".

A British inventor is the first country in which the microchip is equipped with a domestic chip, so that his office can be open and even with a car movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip between Chip and Daumen, now offers the companies and individuals who want to make life easier for their company through technology.

Has the PSG Barcelona before three years ago?
The side of La League may be interested in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not be able to dissolve their Neymar ’ s offer of £189 million, after being released in 189 years ago.
The sensational approach has plummeted the summer in the summer, because Ligue 1 is prepared to break the world record more than 89 million pounds of the previous double brand, with Paul Pogba in Manchester, where he returned to Manchester United for £89 million.
After the end of Neymar, the world ’ s most expensive players in the world and pay more than 500,000 PSG offers more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way in which Neymar has forced his way out there, even though a source of prestige near Katalmar, has always done its best to ensure that the club has always been in place since 2013.
But was the football world before three years ago by the President of the PSG?
As Manchester City 2014, the signing of Blaise Matuidi Nasser, Al Khaier had a strong warning to anyone who wanted to sign a strict warning to the best PSG players.
"I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will contact them in opposition, we will contact them," Al-Khaifi Al-Kh.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players will have consequences.
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish Association of PSG at the beginning of the summer players of the PSG Marco Verratti.

Interview: "Domen-spatzen Report et Georg Papst-brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domatzen-Missouri report on abuses of waste.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on Misssdal for the scandals at the Domsburger Domatzen provides further discussions.
Christian Weisnder, the Speaker of the Reformist Church, "We are looking forward to the publication of the German press agency".
It would serve the image of the Catholic Church if Muller and Ratzinger Müller expressed its deep regret at the time, or its own misassessment of the events.
The Vatican Law Firm Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized reporting on violence in the domain of "double standards.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is shameful and shameful deeds', and the future must be punished; but in future, the mediation of the "Manipula", but the degree of authoritative "Lucetta Scarcetta, a member of the Italian historian and national bioethic agents.
"The Angewood", the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already a part of everyday life, and the public opinion is preparing for the scaffary.
For example, Gloria Thurn and Thurn Taxis said in the interview with Bayerische Rundfunk: "" "" "." "". "" "" "" "" "" ".,,,,,,,,,
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, 'young people were a normal' pedagogical means' to have been ready to be 'with children, as I have been done.
It is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on misuse of reports, too often, the brother of Georg Papzinger.
The author is quite wrong, and says Michael Hesemann, with the interest rate of the memory band "My brother" (Pap).
"I must take Georg Ratzinger to protect" Hesemann says nothing, because all the results he had to do with him.
What exactly is the 440-4seized in the report by the Regensburg Bissburg, with the Enlightenment of Ulrich Weber??
In total, 47 Domsburger Domspatzen was born between 1945 and 1945, with high plausibility of "sacrifices of 67" Domusispatzen ".
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, Georg von 1964 to 1994, from 1964 to 1994: "Regens"".,,,,,, the of,,, and.
Particularly in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for pupils could be even more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other victims, many complain that humanity has sacrificed general assessments of humanity and, in many cases, despite violence and even positive memories.
In interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on Misssdal about the abuse of the Regensburger Domzinger, Georg Ratzin.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-sided side incidents over the "violence of thousands of victims of violence in the rainfall of the Domsfoen in Germany.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity.
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholera and performer, he has been a performer when he has not been a performer.
How do you evaluate this biograph report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and the whole 440 pages from the long front, you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg Ratzinger.
He is just about eight pages dedicated to him and his suspicion of sexual abuse or complicity in cases of sexual abuse.
The violence of texzesse also preview outside its sphere of action.
You may not be accustomed to accuse him of being too late or not.
The domain spasimnyasium, which was practically applied to all respondents, was literally "- as a" redemption "," and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his pupils, Georg Ratzinger, is an excellent testimony to him as a "warm," warm, "sincere" and "well-understood", "and" teacher "," as well as the young teacher, who regularly praises the cake of the cake and bons of children.
Only a minority complained about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to anger.
The fact that he has not only stools with stools and stools on the ground, but also on the ground, Ofregen and distributed all too often to the hair.
In his honor, however, it must be said that such recovery methods were disseminated in the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s, when parents were widely disseminated.
Do you know more about such methods?
Of course, I think everyone was born before 1968.
I have also experienced a secular school, a Gymnasium.
Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the abuse of sexual violence, abuse and abuse of the texzessen on the.,,, and,,,,,,,,, and. and,,,,,,,,,, and
As if one wonders whether it is not familiar with his role and his brother, Benedict XVIBenedict XVIs has just begun to do so.
On the Bavarian Papal work, many of whom have never understood him.
The truth, however, is: the report by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, the report was very much about the abuse of rainfall in the domain of Regensburg.
Will Georg Ratzinger be included in the final report or any reference to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: no.
No one of the victims of sexual assaults, claiming that Domkapellmeister has become familiar.
Not even parents were bored.
"I never dared to speak with my father, or my mother said about it," I was a deputy for the other people who had been very embarrassed to me.
The real problem with the enlightenment of sexual abuse is that most victims.
If they were not even parents and siblings, then the choir will certainly not have been appointed, but the choir of the perpetrators.
How do the domain name rate for pupils in the Ratzingers?
Michael Hesemann: A student questioned: "In so far as to sexual abuse... I do not see a case in which case he would have been able to hold the interest rate (timely and timely).
I also think it is absurd to assume that it is more important to him...
It is inconceivable to talk about sex.
The result of the report is quite clear: 'The fact that it was possible for the pupils concerned and their environment, or the study was confirmed in the context of the investigation'.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger has been released by everyone.
Nor can it be accused of not being brought to him or her display.
That is why there is no good reason to oppose this crime in relation to external action, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, much of "texzessen" was in the rainfall of the Domsburger Domatz.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger report will look at the way forward.
Do he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that reporting is missing and everything has been mixed up in a huge sexual abuse and misuse of force, somewhere in the middle of a texzezinger, Georg Ratdrin.
But this is precisely a misuse of the report.
Because the fact that there is a separate preview of the gymnasium and the abuse of sexual abuse between the texzessen and violence, we say once again.
In addition, the report deals with waste from 1945, including four decades, Georg Ratzinger, Georg Domzinger, was not the head of the chorus.
The whole caning pedagogical, pedagogical cases where the knees of sadistic teachers have been rightly cited, and have suffered appalling and horrific conditions, including those that have suffered from the scandalous Eternal Pizhofen and.
But with those who had not had anything to do with Georg Domzinger, because he got the boy to do so until they were already on the face of Domyasimnasium.
On the subject, like most of the witnesses, the most taboo subject "preview".
It was only happy to escape her and his genome so much better treatment for many "and even better treatment".
What was different from that domain spasimnyasium?
Michael Hesemann: Since there was no discipline but discipline, no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, which is why the report concludes that many of the victims' general humanity ', despite many cases of violence and, in spite of many positive memories.
For example, at most, the accusation is still being built.
But, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported on the condition of.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself as a predecessor of a school, and he was not responsible for the fact that he did not want to hear (and then he).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Does Georg Ratzinger still remain consistent with the assurances?
Michael Hesemann: No, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domyasimnasium, who even reproduce the report.
It points out that he says that the 'Prüm' will continue to practice practice the caning '.
In view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended that he should intervene.
That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was banned as a caning in Bavaria.
Davor Gragnor she knows, in a legal grey area, as everyone knows.
Since it was difficult to estimate him, where the affected or perhaps exaggerated dramatized and where the limit was actually exceeded.
However, it is not possible to say that he would always have looked away.
That is simply not true.
Only in 1980, the caning was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Principality of Gloria Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards.
What do you see?
Michael Hesemann: "We talk of historians" of Fallachronism ", that is, in other words, the moral hazard of the past.
Since the prince has already quite right.
But that does not apply to sexual abuse, of course, at all times, and this was not the case for the preview of the innocent and incitement violence in children ’ s seold-fashioned, which goes far beyond the usual.,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally working.
But at the same time, Georg Ratzinger has to do nothing to do with him.
His disciplines to discipline and punishment, therefore, Ohran, and the hair to the ears and ears were disseminated in 1970ies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When physical punishment was banned, it was strictly forbidden.
What image of his Regensburger Zeit has given to you during his talks with Georg Ratzinger for the book "My brother"?
Kam raised the issue of caning.
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about life, but the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI.
Nevertheless, I am not in any way that he led a strict regime.
But it must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without calling for the discipline of unconditional discipline, it would not have been possible to do so until then, it would have been possible to create a true world heritage of Europe ’ s cultural ambassador (1987) and its musical tradition twice in 1991 and 1988 (Japan).
With Keksen and Bonbons alone, it is now inconsistent with no big sawmill and every success in every area.,,,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When what do you have experienced people, since Georg Ratzinger talks with her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and I have also learnt very well, I really enjoyed the wonderful and beautiful, always as humorous, humorous, deep and heartfelt felt that people could not imagine that he could do something.
I get regular contact with him, as many former Dome Emerities, 23 years after his contact Emerities, regularly read him, he is blind, and he is almost blind - as a member of his family.
Those who are not forgiven to him that he was even too strict, so they are clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him for having enriched their lives and enriched the music of the world.
And that he always was a good teacher, a teacher - a strict father, but certainly his loving father - but he was also a loving respect for the loving.
And I would ask you once again to make it clear what you were accusing him of having been on the agenda.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair, because it is only a prominent man, and has a prominent brother to make even more medial sin.
It is clear that the intention behind it.
The report, which has just been published, has just been published.
Now, the Anstand areas, a 3-year old man who has acquired great merit, and perhaps no one in the Bavarian Regensburg and Germany, perhaps no one would know the domains of peace.
