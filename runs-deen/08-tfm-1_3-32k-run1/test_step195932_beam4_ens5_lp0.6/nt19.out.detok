DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil ’ s return to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on talking to him once again about why he felt that one or another was as perceived in his statement," said Grindel in the soccer podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the debate that has now taken months on photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he deplores the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed, to some extent, that this would be the case, 'said Grindel.
De 29-year-olds explained his resignation from the DFB team in July, and he also justified that Grindel did not defend him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB boss reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared to talk to Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to put pressure on him, but he knows it from football that if "you leave a team or change an association, you talk about it with his trainer and I find it a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Gartenhütte in Schrebergartensiedlung brannte
At 2.13 p.m. the professional fire brigade Linz was alarmed to fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage pipeline leads directly to the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was delayed.
The professional fire rifle arrived and found the hut in full fire.
The roof had to be completely removed and fire-shoe completely removed to the required extent.
According to owner of the burning garden hut, he had raised a battery to store at lunch.
This may be the cause of fire.
In any case, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity according to fire brigade.
The damage caused by the fire must be determined, as must the cause of the fire.
It should be considerable, however, because the owner had many collectors' pieces in his garden hut.
Outstanding Mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee families on the open road.
What did Lindsay Lohan only take on this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to deprive children of an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has itself staggered live, as a family in Moscow apparently wants to deprive children.
This reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a part of the streaming.
Here you can see "Luckily purchased" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see how Lohan is out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to portray as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family almost flew before the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of trafficking in children.
For all this it does not provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this just", Lohan is heard in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems that the obviously angry mother is enough.
It looks as if it turns around and Lohan missed a slap.
Under tears, the actress insists on how shocked she is - and she keeps the cheek.
What Lohan has applied for this action is now completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid.

British Conservative Party Day
Sharf - the Tories Party Day
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party ’ s day is about foreign policy, trade, and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the hardline Brexiteers, on the front line of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
Macedonia's Foreign Ministers (right) and Greece have already agreed.
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing for years about these naming doubles.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population is voting on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.

Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned.
"The Diesel test force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Managing Director of Development.
The detained and certified Audi Chief Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations are likely to be tested", he said at that time.
Mertens now said: 'At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in the recovery of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 following the discovery of diesel scandals at the Volkswagen Audi Mother.
Mertens pointed out that the Autobauer made 'serious organisational changes' so that such a scandal never happens again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler ’ s future and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust emissions after acquaintances.
He knew about the manipulation or deliberately ignored it.
Bram Schot is currently managing sales as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the changeover to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption testing standard, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronner Stimme".
Basically, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the A6, A7 and A8 Audi models produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm is to go to the DFB Bureau.
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, wants to stand again for the post as DFB president next year.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes," said Grindel as guest at the early Sunday morning in the "current sports studio" of the ZDF.
I will do so again and again.
Then you have to look at whether the support is there.
According to its own words, the head of association would be "curious" if he did not want to work on the future project after the European Football Championship 2024.
Grindel has been the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach ’ s summer fairytale affair since April 2016.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future Chief Executive, Philipp Lahm, is to work with the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to advise the Bureau on this role and then, of course, be invited to provide his experience in sporting matters", said Grindel.
Speculations about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan affair with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire for a national player to become integration ambassadors of the DFB in the future.
Currently, this office of native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is a clear impact on society and football without a background of migration and says," the subject is important, we must take care of it ", which would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Declining with a halfwise Waage
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The Body Mass Index calculates the thing, but it is more for the sausages.
Does he say nothing about whether I have replaced fat with muscles.

Erdoğan opens Mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib-Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day visit to the country.
Critique of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite residents of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to act against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers from the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
For the opening of the Ditib-Mosque the city of Cologne was partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were in use - including snipers.
The Islamic Union Ditib is criticized for being the prolonged arm of the Turkish Government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Musik gegen Armut: Stars, Buhrufe und Schrecksekunde
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have campaigned for more commitment in the fight against poverty and disease in a joint concert in New York Central Park.
"If you are interested in what you can do," Mendes said at the festival in the night about 60,0000 spectators on Sunday.
Thank you for coming here, that is a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with Fransen and golden microphone.
I am nervous, I sweat, but it is okay, because I am here and ready to change the world.
Actors like Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations, and aid agencies, have also been on stage in the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a spectator of horror when many spectators thought that the noise of a falling metal shutdown was thought to be shots, were afraid and tried to flee.
Shortly, panic arose, people ranted.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed out people from the stage.,,, and.,,,.
"Nobody tries to hurt anyone", Martin said.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert took place every year on the internet.
Anyone who wanted a ergattern had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there was jubel and applause from the audience, but for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This spoke together with his democratic colleague, Chris Coons, on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the US Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge and thus put many women in front of their heads.
At least three women have raised abuses allegations to attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects them.
Flake called for a FBI investigation into allegations after two women who, according to their own data, have experienced sexual assaults on the way to committee meeting in a lift.
"You can also meet me at any time in a lift", said Flake at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: German government defends Rauswurf of the journalist
Governmental spokesman Steffen Seibert defended a journalist from Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s press conference (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German writings "Freedom for Journalists" and went to the first row.
The T-shirt, was not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disorder of the press conference.
The campaign by the journalist has caused a great deal of unrest, which is unacceptable.
He has therefore led people to bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether or not this is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership of banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
Turkey ’ s leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are under threat for several decades.
Foreign journalists are also unsure of the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel have caused a stir.
They came freely and could return to Germany, but there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and good, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
We have to look at it twice: yes, that is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is known for humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour kneipe "Schellfischposten".
Modern Ina Müller meets with its guests with beer, some wine or even more sophisticated drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few promiss also drink courage for the obligatory vocal instincts.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is famous for films such as "Men's Heart", "Terror - Your judgment" or "The White Day".
However, the trip to the north of Munich was not good at all.
On Saturday he postulated a Selfie - his face is completely shattered, the eyes only two small slits.
The Bett-Selfie shows a completely excited Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful cater.
He postulated to his fans some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: goes NIE to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black sau.
And syringe.
And the round of Eierlikör, which melts around half three, also leaves away.
Alcohol consumption is truly written into the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the offspring.
They were enriched by instant breasts, fish crumbs, or - probably the most targeted - headache pills.
Other amusing people simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema.
As Ina Müller has survived the nocturnal suction bearing, it is not known.
Since they have been moderating the TV fun on the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly tried out...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to contend with vandalism and betrayal
The entry into Treysa ’ s 36-kilometre cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Scherben, Zigarettenkippen, Müll und Unrat, demolierte Mülleimer und mittlerweile demontierte Hinweisschilder - so präsentiert sich seit Längerem der Einstieg mit Sitzgruppe zum Radweg auf dem Haaße-Hügel in Treysa.
For the flagship project Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland, a more than unbelievable sight.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC district group Schwalmstadt as well as others for longer, so the radar representative of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the Radverkehrsbeirat.
There has not been a solution.
The proposals range from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of waste containers and cleaning of the land at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible other activities", says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the issue has also been brought to the local advisory board.
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place at weekends.
It is not only common to say that gelagen is destroyed: upwards from the earth, dustbin demolished, shielded, seat furniture smelled.
Volunteers had already been cleaned up more frequently, ADFC member Susanne Klippert tells.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
You are annoyed that the Rastplatz on the bike path is a meeting place for suction bearings.
"Along the entire cycle path there is a clear focus on the Haaße hill," the Radverkehrsbeauftragte, who is now also responsible for the new wheelchair in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she relies on the same fate, it will be quite expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps the threshold is much higher to interfere with common good.
That would, however, presuppose that a police strike should be brought forward in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the Haaße-Hügel.
It must be made more attractive.
In fact, the frequency of the cycle path can be very satisfied.
Tourism marketing is still eligible for development.
Our cycling path is very high quality compared to others in Germany, so the ADmembers. are. and are and,,,, and,,,,,
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa as a highly critical danger point.
There is no Abbiegespur on the Haaße hill.
In the case of traffic it may happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of traffic ", she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest in the Kulturbahnhof: Die "Kö von Hiltrup" und der See
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and collaborative.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for large and small young and experienced musicians".
As Karl Franke put it, a contest "with eye-cokers in the sympathetic Hiltruper family".
In fact, it was soon a family coexistence with coffee and cake from the honorary official of the Kulturbahnhofs.
Seven formations took place, from the Ein-Mann-Band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albachtener in Hiltrup, the Nine from the Hiltruper Sternfarben, three members and three generations of families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, as the mayor Joachim Schmidt declared, is a novelty.
We have not seen that in other parts of the city.
What were the textures associated with?
The Hiltruper lake and the market alley were mentioned in the places.
Rolf Ihmig arbitrated the avenue in his beating song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Time and again, it was a question of the experience of coexistence in these places, especially in Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short upheavals with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their work.
For example, Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
From Tontechniker Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that the recent arrival in Ludwigshafen took place at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed everything on Youtube.
"It is not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury's favorites - so that others can listen to their songs.
An entire CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children came up again for the final - and even without electronic support - 'good', as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects originality, relation to Hiltrup, intangibility of the melody and recognition value.
The jury attended Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß vom KvG-Gymnasium und Oliver Ahlers vom Wirtschaftsverbund sowie Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The city part offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She valued the event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game.
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords you - the old trick with the red slide - can only be deciphered when you have inserted them.
This ensures that the opposite side can not read anything.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Window.
3.
4. Festival.
These are the terms that need to be encrypted.
For guessing should not be the terms here, but codes.
Switching one player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card which may be "3.4.2".
Decrypto is not the words behind the secret film, but its encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "feast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and that the opposing team does not as much as possible; because that wins the game if it succeeds twice in cracking the code.
The encoder thus notifies and reads according to: "Werfen" for the cube, "Lose" as opposed to feast; here, of course, there would be something like "Party" possible and "Prague" because it has been in school and knows the window curtain there.
This is the way round for the team, team for the team.
You don't know the terms of the opposite - but you can get better together with any indication that the encryption gives there.
Perhaps mysterious, but not turned off, the conversions should be, otherwise it will be unnecessarily difficult for his team.
The most cryptic of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule booklet.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time until they can finally play.
The explanatory video under decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But anyone who has just started will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconceivable game.,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, "Decrypto" is not quite as coherent as predecessors and Genre-Primus "codenames", which is also an agent language to play less words but is much better in small groups.
And who is only about rats and not about winning points, which can easily add a version for two.
Kulmbach: Mann zeigt Polizei Hitlergruß und belästigt Gäste in der Kneipe
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspectorate Kulmbach twice the night from Saturday to Sunday.
Only in the Upper City of a bypass police strike did he show the heat pit, and later he also fell in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After being clearly alcoholised by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspectorate Kulmbach in prison cell.
In a sober state, it must then be prosecuted because of the use of marks of unconstitutional organisations.
Pressig factory was home to Schublok ’ s
The railway operations in Pressig were the hub of the Frankenwald for decades.
1991 ended a piece of railway history.
"When buffers hit buffers, one heard it all in Pressig," Georg Dinkel, who archived the history of the place and the train station.
That did not inspire anyone.
As quietized the brakes and scattered the wagons.
That was just railway.
Statements that are meaningful for Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place shaped by the railways.
Here, the starting point of the Steilrampen route to the north, which has its crossroads in Steinbach am Wald after an increase of about 220 metres above sea level.
In order to cope with this, it was necessary to train and Schublok who had their home in Pressig earlier.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station with 21 locomotives, apprenticeship workshop, driving guidance and railway mastery.
"Herzstück war die Drehscheibe, die nach einem Umbau 1899 einen Durchmesser von 18 Metern hatte", erzählt Norbert Heidrich aus Hirschaid, Bahnhistoriker und 47 Jahre Berufseisenbahner.
Pressig (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, was also operated by Loks for the side routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalbbetrieben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 1939 electrification already minimized the need for train and Schublok.
In 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 walls were still in place.
In 1982, parts of the plant were broken down in 1991.
Heidrich: 'It is regrettable that we did not envisage better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport'.
Even at Pfingsten in 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the jubilee "50 years Electrification Nürnberg - Saalfeld" a pompous Bahnhofsfest in Pressig.
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here", Georg Dinkel remembers.
Little later.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The rangers and inhibitors learned the most difficult work in train traffic", recalls thighs.
Any failure would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledonsiegerin Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.

With great relief registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach, the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Around Walberla" in the series "Kunst und Genuss".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was shown by a large visitor ’ s entitlement.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the exhibition.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name as the main organizer and artist alike.
Some surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task in tried and tested young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have made flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of art & enjoyment, there is another 70-cent special letter that was designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn dance", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high approval of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was able to win the musical repertoire.
In the course of the generous garden, the visitor will quickly realize that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges artistic imagination and expresses playfully ultimately.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with coloured accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, visitors on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" from the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree-stump, colored, playful with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes.
With the sun pervading through the bushwork in the background, the object looks fairy and invites you to linger.
From Eckental Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate himself to the event 15 years K & G in three-dimensional letters.
Many parts are moving in the wind.
For half a distance, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imaginative structure made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for smuggling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 albums: Singers celebrate 50th birthday festively.
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albums also made their displeasure air.
At least five of them.
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no longer a sangesleben in the district.
It has become a legend: At a bank in the ink bush they raised the MGV 68 records from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It will be full today", Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should retain right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singer.
Own for the jubilee, they had let the foundation party live up again.
For years there was a tradition, then there was a break.
The traditional festival was back in time for 50 years.
An elegant ball was asked for festive clothes before.
The guests were sitting on tables rather than sitting in the "Haus der Begegnung".
In the meantime, DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln raised the shelves and asked for the dance floor.
Honestly, the singers of the MGV 68 albums themselves made the voice heard.
It was a good occasion to celebrate songs.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high class Derby against BW Aasee.
The climber marched.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring finds itself right in league three.
No trace of Scheu or Fracksausen who make their thing independent.
And that at 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city competition BW Aasee is good.
"That was not crystal clear, but we have already left the impression," says the reasonably satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not satisfied with that; on the contrary.
In the evening, at a later birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good and the game.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third sentence the guests had a Satzball.
"If they get the target, a game can kick", Büring knows from years of experience.
After all, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and brought full yield to the goal.
"We all know who stands in such a derby on the other side.
That does not break us with the genius.
I have seen phase-wise good volleyball ", did not stop Annacker with the 0: 3 - and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the journey for independence goes, after just three days of the game does not seem to be foreseeable.
"For this it is simply too early", says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional liga volleyball; in the fourth league, they no longer want to look downwards.
If the West is not polluted in the next few weeks, they must look up.
A first assessment can only be made after ten or eleven matches.
On Saturday it is only possible to reach Emlichheim.
Aasee joins Essen on October 14.

Her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband.
On the "Traumschiff" Heide Keller became the star.
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series could have had a share of her spouse with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series that made them the star could be partly responsible for their failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"This could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues took me true on an equal footing, "tells Keller in conversation with the" picture on Sunday ".
First of all, she was always only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
For now, journalists only shouted at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked that.
She thinks it is possible that her former husband might have been envious, but "as many men also shy Hans talks about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have changed myself "as she explains.
She has always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, whom I was in fact never, even though I sometimes seemed freak and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever '.
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time".
On the day before the ceremony, I sat in the shade and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why it never worked with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller presented himself with love at the time as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I have approached love too naively.
The night falter, who regularly explores the city ’ s nightlife at the NZZ resort, dared to visit the ZFF opening party.
Our folder is not a moth, but a little light-shy.
And the sheer glory in which a green carpet is immersed in the six-pillar square blends it with a fee.
But it is halt Film Festival, because more or less famous want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
This late Thursday evening, he torkelt over the square to ease himself in the "Aquaclean-WC oasis".
The public toiletries sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the people in need in the parterra of a new pavilion have taken a lot of trouble to redevelop a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, in the Herren Oasis, for some reason, stinks to the sky.
So here, beaten on the other side of the street: Happy guests who have just entertained the Green Book at the opening film "Green Book" at the same level as every year celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey store.
His name fits perfectly with this film festival: as we all know, the works shown are from all over the world.
What does not have to be imagined in an article about this festival in order not to fall into veil advertisements for its 190 partner companies.
The wrist binds himself a bench around the paddlers, which has given him a good fat, and two bulky door hooks really get him in general.
Drinks are crowded, they dance far after midnight to live music, or they can be pretended by DJ rhythms, to which they perceive each other, and rinse with Cüpli exquisite choirs.
In the Delikatessenladen in the souterrain, Austern is waiting for sleepy Münder, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain jumps.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without any significant losses.
We must love this country!
The folder studies the sign in the roller staircase: "wear a long dress, please be careful on the roller staircase".
If the two separate instructions are given, he has lost himself in the Dresscode.
But it is more a conditionality construction, and that has certainly saved lives.
In the household section on the upper floor, the poultry tilted a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", fitting to the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not get the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been campaigning for this brand for years, is not here in the evening.
However, it draws a face between local romisins, cassette and kitchen articles, a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character should not be far away.
And really: Just walk Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost like a choir cut, through the crowd.
It is not tormented, it is not obtained, it is not recommended at all.
It is precisely for this restraint that international stars like to be misunderstood as a connotation who love this film festival.

Swen Bieletzki, Coach of the Handball Verbandsligisten ASV Senden, was hard to grasp: "So a bitter defeat". "" after 29 29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They did not play badly over long periods, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst.
Only the initial phase "we have completely squandered", the ASV trainer was angry.
Shortly thereafter, the owners, with 8: 1, even the early departure that Bieletzki had taken, first.
"Then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summarized the second quarter of an hour.
For the break, the lag was only two goals.
In particular, Senden ’ s bester, Marius Hintze, met for another time in the phase.
After the change, it was even better from a visitor ’ s perspective.
After 33 minutes David Ernst compared to 15: 15, then the stage-changer almost went through.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Griffen the impartial into action.
Bieletzki usually avoids looking for the blame for others.
But: The 120 seconds penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff paid was a joke.
LIT had laughed well and, until the end, met four times - during the decimated ASV even in the last attack.
The guys have struggled very well at the back, even against seven men, and have repeatedly thrown out the empty door..
Only can they buy little for the compliments.

Bavaria: Missing for 30 years - Police graves after body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the mortal remains of the woman.
On Saturday, at Marxgrün, the force pitched a road.
To this end, the day of the road and several layers were removed, such as the police and prosecutor ’ s office, together.
According to new findings, the missing persons may have been buried not far from their place of residence at the time.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
At that time, the investigators did not complete a crime.
Since last year the Criminal Court has been working intensively with the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian National Monument Protection Agency, the investigators came up with a ground radar for a vulnerability under the road at Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials took the place at a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of using complicated letter sequences, users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, even if it does not damage computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the Tesla electric car manufacturer, has escaped his threat of redundancy as head of the milliard business.
He and the US stock exchange supervisor SEC provided a legal dispute over misleading Twitter news, in which Musk could have lost permission to lead listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk gives the Chairman ’ s office for three years, a position comparable to that of the German.
On the other hand, he may remain.
In comparison, which has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla failed.
The SEC had prosecuted the United States Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, which is also the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss of electric car pioneers, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he might take the company from the stock exchange, paying $420 per share that funding was secured.
In this way, Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion in.
Later, Musk rebuilt: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla now needs to find an outward-looking chairman, hire two independent board members, and set up a committee that monitors Musk Communications.

After the worst season start since 1989, Manchester United has slipped ever deeper into the crisis.
The team of the contentious coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United with 1: 3 (0: 2) and remains only in the table middle field with ten points after seven days.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow in front of the Champions-League-Match on Tuesday against FC Valencia.

Polls: 46% do not want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021.
After the last few weeks ’ crossings, the GroKo collects several surveys.
The SPD is falling behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is being viewed critically.
Berlin - Die AfD hat die SPD im Emnid-Sonntagstrend für die Bild am Sonntag bundesweit erstmals überholt.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD places a counter at 17%, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16%.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union on Sunday.
The Greens reach 15%, the left 11, and the FDP 10%.
If federal elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU, and CSU, according to Emnid, would receive only 43% of the vote.
The grand coalition has now lost the majority on Sunday, with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties are consistently reaching 43 to 45% of the votes (Allensbach: 51%).
In the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4%.
In other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, in several polls, is the second strongest party, reaching 15-18%.
The Greens reach voting shares of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average 10%, FDP at 9%.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an upward and downward uncertainty depending on the proportion of votes.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
At the moment, only 48% of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey showed on behalf of the BamS.
According to the poll, only one (50%) wants the grand coalition to be re-elected by the next regular federal election in three years.
Even in another poll published on Saturday, there was a marked drop in popularity for Merkel.
Gespalten also judge the Germans whether Merkel should stand again for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47% are against.
Thus, 64% do not want a candidate for the Union ’ s membership, 35%.
Aushang bei Aldi: Preisreduziert zum Liebesglück
Will Aldi to Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic connoisseurs stories - he should talk about Putenfleisch at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "Fastfood-Datings" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romance as a meeting place for the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced putenmeat, boxershort barrels at the feel table or the favorite pudding is still in doubt a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The App Tinder is called to be less a contact, but rather a smart stock exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react, not long about the bush in the first message?
The astonishing result here.
Hollywood-Lovestory ’ s regulatory potential is when the love affair precedes an out-and-lost loop.
If the type is still registered under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch @ gmx.de at his Angebeteten, this sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this Annonce in an unknown Aldi-Filiale to wish that she will also find her funeral with which she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced bio-plaster meat".
She certainly deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood for her faith in the analogue magic.

Football: District League: Researcher Auftritt des VfL Wolbeck gegen den SC Altenrhein macht Mut
There were moments in this young season, as Alois Fetsch went to court with the ropes hard.
Wortkarg returned to the Coach of the football league VfL Wolbeck, only to make sense of the lack of power on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it is running around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beleg is 1: 1 am Sonntag gegen den SC Altenrhein, in der vergangenen Spielzeit nur hauchdünn am Aufstieg vorbeigeschrappt.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We have tightened the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen ", Fetsch praised his guys and sought every individual after the game, simply to say" thank you "for so much counter-defense against the ambitious guests.
The Coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - the 4-4-4-2 went almost seamlessly over in a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was in the front line on balls.
Wolbeck had much more shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his death (17), the exchanged Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38) missed the lead.
Almost this would have been the case when the SCA in minute 41 would have appeared in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker caste - Tormann Damian Hallas proved himself a master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes fell out of 18 metres.
Schroer also arrived late after 58 minutes at a theoretical entry.
With the interaction of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed the left side again a hair cell.
As an old rhein Chris Naberbäumer in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there were 18 meters before the guesthouse an indirect push for the placeholder.
The Gefoulte stood up for itself and demonstrated his vulnerability to standards.
Westhues "Ding with the right snake struck at the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1: 0 (71).
20 minutes still, which should be damned for a long time.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penal room unhappy.
Schiedsrichter Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately showed the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Bange minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase before Geske had the chance to win the 87th minute at 12 meters.
Had there perhaps been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes.

Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards.
This was only 8% of the boards of directors on the cut-off date of 1 September, as stated in the report "The power of monoculture", officially presented on this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and pre-empted the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will miss them," said Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the US, the UK, or Sweden, executives - with a few exceptions - are far from manageable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is another corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses among the companies in the index of the medium sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright data, only 6.8% of the boards are female.
Last year, however, the figure was 3.8%.
Over the past few years, the 30 Dax companies have been leading the way - stagnated the proportion of women.
Last, 26 women worked on boards.
"I am sure that next year the Dax companies will again recruit more consistent women - in their own interests," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would continue to make no commitment to increase the proportion of "zero percent" up to now.
Another picture comes from the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men were less than a year ago.
"Recruiting as many women per year for the boards of directors would reach a 40% share in 2023," says the report.

Large cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Whoever makes the most profit per car among the precious suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers pay per car they sell?
This question has been dealt with by "autopapst" and an economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari won 69,000 euros in the first half of the year with each sold car - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley put on a strong footing even every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros of profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

Manchester United is losing again, for Mourinho, it is untiring
Manchester United is now losing out in the seventh round of the Premier League.
Towards West Ham United, ManU 1: 3. The way of defeat is likely to continue to speak.
The scene was sensuous in the 74th minute in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3: 1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back to the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel ’ s pass, all Manchester ’ s defenders remained standing, and Arnautovic left all the time of the world to throw the ball at helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative culmination of a previously insufficient performance over long distances.
There is a very different mood at Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinhos ’ great competitor Pep Guardiola turned Brighton & Hove Albion into an approximate 2: 0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke out for the home team for the first time the defensive barrier of the outside party.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the previous guard, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the table tip.
Liverpool no longer Table leader
Three days after 1: 2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1: 1 against Chelsea.
As with the cup-out, the Belgier Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The match of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the final stage of the only match of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his smuggler.
After the editors had started with a spotless record in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First, Jürgen Klopp ’ s London team eliminated the league ’ s blues Liverpool from Remis.
Like City, both London ’ s Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2: 0 wins.
The fans of the Gunners, who played Granit Xhaka, had to tolerate the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end buxed Watford defender Craig Cathcart a hero of Alex Iwobi unhappy into his own gateway, just two minutes later Mesut Özil, with his third season meeting for the decision.
Arsenal passed after Watford ’ s fifth victory and is just behind Tottenham ’ s big rivals. A strong impression remains that Wolverhampton is under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves stayed at 2: 0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth consecutive time and occupy the 8th place.
VW ’ s core brand is missing: Paris ’ automobile salon in the light of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue, but ubiquitous: the diesel scandal and the struggle for bans and retrofitting should not leave the German car companies out of business at the Paris industry meeting.
In the 2018 automotive salon, they show their novelties from next week, together with competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not really matter any more.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, should nevertheless be an important issue, at least behind the shining scenes of the exhibition.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models among others: the e-tron of the Ingolstadt is due to enter the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgarter 2019.
Both were officially presented.
The iNext of BMW will not start until 2021.
The new 3er is at the centre of Paris.
More than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in their own halls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors came.
During the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first Beben had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport links have been damaged, there has been enormous material damage.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke out over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered together on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims is still significantly higher.
The figures date only from Palu.
Many other communities are affected, however, along Sulawesis ’ west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final god service for motorcyclists in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdohl - The place in front of the peace church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the programme.
Frank Schröder is responsible for the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus for the southernmost concerns of the PS-strong two-wheeler.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle gothic service (MoGo) takes place at the Haus Nordhelle on Sunday of a month.
The bikers are traditionally celebrating the end of the season in Eveking's peace church.
On Sunday around 150 bikers met to celebrate a service that is far from usual.
The Bolides were already open before the entrance portal of the church from 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First of all, the biker boast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a soft curry sausage.
Besides the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach were also present.
The preaching was held during the Biker worship of Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical underscore.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill proposes rather poetic-quiet tones", says Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle god service yesterday.
Folk orfer Heimatverein celebrates great festivities: After the apple comes milk.
Borisch was also active during the day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Great interest also aroused Georg Hartmann Niemerg.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his astonishing spectators step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann Niemerg leave the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, a fine crushed mass was removed from the apples.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how to become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this late Friday afternoon.
In forms packed and wrapped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacks a little like hackselgut looking apple pieces for layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran after and after into a large vessel.
However, the farmer had already completed completed specialties.
He opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest spring white to older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly large.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents met, while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press, but also the built Hüpfburg for themselves.
Also active members of the observation team of former soldiers committed themselves within the framework of the festival and invited them to play short games at some stations.
Also next year, the Heimatverein will offer an action day.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home house will not be in the heart of the Savings Bank of the Place of Action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious on the basis of the subject: after all, there will be some milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season bankrupt: "Beschissene Situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat after each other, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointing profits from Hanover 96 and spoke to them courage.
A lot of positive things were done before at 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt, however.
"It's a divorce situation, but you have to smoke as a team," said 96-soccer profile Pirmin Schwegler and shocked: "Of course this is disappointing because you always take a lot ahead".
The more vicious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86) came to an end, are down with two meters and are a descent candidate in their current constitution.
On the other hand, the first-ever Saison-Heimsieg celebrated by.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) achieved the goals of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who proposed the European League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table after the successful general test.
Croatia ’ s vice-champion Rebic was almost involved in any dangerous offensive of the armies at his start debut and never got to grips with Hannovers ’ defense.
The long troubled storms following the World Cup showed at its speed and perseverance why it is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was born from the FC Liverpool, was the first time in the early formation of Frankfurt, which began to flourish.
One of Lucas Torró ’ s headball counterfeited on the Torró Torró Tor network (17) was at risk for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense against the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-run Kevin Wimmer (back).
Leadership for the Hausherren fell almost inevitable and entirely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defensive corner in the penal room, an indoor prolonged by head to the gate where Ndicka only needed to keep the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga meeting in the summer of the French two-league player AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt continued before the break.
This time Haller adapted to his Sturmpartner Rebic, who skilfully danced and 96-Torwart Michael Esser left no chance.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach reacted to the weak idea of his elf and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony, though somewhat bolder, played forward, but sparked ideas remained until the end, when the follow-up was still successful.
The heels were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then pushed across De Guzmán, who had to push the ball to the empty gate.
The rest was only a show for the Frankfurt guests, even Jovic met one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile.
In spite of cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich Lord Mayor Dieter Reiter managed to open the 185 millionth public at the opening.
Munich Wies' n last week with two strokes.
Geising: Geisinger Christians celebrate Heilig-Kreuz-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Heilig-Kreuz-Fest on September 14 or on Sunday afterwards.
The Festgottesdienst takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Heilig-Kreuz-Kirche with the closing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the stormed Christ, which dates from the 30-year-old war and which the legend is to have shot after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed out of the firing.
This resulted in a large pilgrimage to the shifted Christ, which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished to date, only the altar room is standing, the missing Langhaus is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, Pfarrer Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service of worship was badly visited despite the importance of the Geisinger parish.
After the worship, the procession took place to the Holy Cross Church and ended with the final blessing of the church part of the Cross.
For many years the Catholic Church choir has been inviting the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish.
The choral members served the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and the weather adjusted, farm eggs.
In the afternoon, the parish church still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid Seger, on behalf of the parish community, informed visitors about the damage to facade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will take place until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be detected more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage that has already been done a few years ago has increased, but more has also been found, which was only possible through the injection by means of scaffolding.
The socket plaster works are completed before the winter is still to be started with the natural stone works and you still hope to be able to complete half of this work this year.
Einweihung: Neues Wohnheim in der Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life aid of Donau-Iller opens a new home for disabled people in the Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in the Münsterblick street now "a very special house" will be handed over to its destination - there were all present at the inauguration date.
After all, the 12 wheelchair users who have been living in Donau-Iller ’ s home have for some time been relying on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas has taken into account architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the US Army ’ s former officer building was tested for the residents of Handycap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in the equipment", said Bader retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators receded to tear the house.
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, so the architect.
Donau-Iller's Life Aid opens a new home.
Around EUR 4.6 million has invested life aid in new construction.
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben EUR 450000.
According to the architect Bader, the construction works remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms.
He also thanked the Managing Director of Life Aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagate between a barrier-free and at the same time moist-resistant construction has not always been easy.
However, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to enjoy the freedom to move around without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants who need tools to be mobile".
In doing so, the viability and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And again: "The land in this situation is a real happiness because it is no longer possible to acquire it in today's situation".
Altogether, the new home in the Münsterblick street offers space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three groups.
We are proud to be Managing Director Heinz on the eleven full-time workers all employed by collective bargaining.
Germany: Schwesig beklagt Differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, the Deputy Chairman of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all compatriots not to be deprived of East Germany.
There are differences that pains unity after almost 30 years.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "said Prime Minister Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, on Sunday.
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable for East Germany, on average, to work longer than the people of West Germany, but to receive 15% less salary.,,,,,,,, and.
"I cannot explain this almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this putative dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan Jagdhund is supposed to smooth the gulf between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan Jagdhunde a gift.
As Moons ’ office announced on Sunday, the two dogs about a year old reached their recipients on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the 'reconciliation of animals'.
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join forces in international sporting competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to join forces to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile drives following mutual rapprochement.
Austria ’ s History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
At the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of commemoration, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in retrospect over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive, sets out in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New Week, New Opportunity for the Government
Back to work on the subject - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition that is now beginning.
Hardly any interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and their ministers from CDU, SPD and CSU have recently summoned the 'return to work on the subject'.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashier and other working citizens in that country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its mandate - governance - it should not now be prevented from discussing concepts.
Whether, after the provocations and blames of recent weeks, the Union and the SPD will, in fact, be able to achieve something together will probably be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties come together to the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, there are again conflicting issues on the agenda with diesel upgrades and the law on skilled immigration.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to give car companies with exchange-rate premiums glimpflich dawn, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to upgrade older diesel.
As a result of the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned legislation on specialist migration.
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or make training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the 'change of track' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be disputes among coalition partners - and how should it be otherwise?
Not the same thing and the same has joined forces with GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Disputes are good.
Without a dispute, society, sometimes characterised by contradictory interests, is not making progress.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be raised again for partisan reasons on the question of being or being.
It is still a question of politics, not of theatre.
Union and SPD should argue - but always look at the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key issue, both diesel and track change can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, the parties must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in Visier
Does the Minister for Labour not violate the current law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" their legalists worked on the social security reform, reported a superficial social minister in the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) arouses surprise - it brings the matter to Parliament via question.
She assumes that "the minister only expressed her enthusiasm for the use of her team and did not want to announce any violations of applicable law in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, they now have questions to be able to release Har ­ tinger from any suspicion '.
Police rides on a street in search of women's light
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to speak.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was anticipated that the investigators had previously set up an archaeologist.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human nodules, was finally able, together with his leader, to limit the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the supreme Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the said road piece.
For more than a year now, the Public Prosecutor and the Criminal Police Court have been abusing the case.
At Marxgrün, a cycle path has been blocked and investigated with sonars because the investigators suspect that during the reconstruction of the state road 30 years ago Heike's body could have been stuck.
Colorpowder and Eier: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia ’ s anniversary
On Monday, the controversial referendum on independence in Catalonia marks the first time.
But there are already riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police came in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked, among other things, by those who advocate independence, by using colour powders to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of national police and civilian guard.
Some 3,000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police forces wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who were in use last year in the polling stations' referendum that was deemed illegal.
In trying to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at that time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the around 6000 separatists would then have attempted to break the police chain by force, and the officials, among other things, were using colour bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested, 24 others were easily injured, and the authorities were invoked.
On Monday, for the first time, the referendum on independence will take place.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain, Catalonia ’ s central government had been forced to govern under coercion in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, flew to exile to Belgium.
Other politicians, too, have turned out abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, however, continue to be imprisoned in U-pris.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
Following the inauguration of the new Catalan Government in May, the forced administration was brought to an end.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the 'right to self-determination' of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Versammelte Ratlosigkeit: FC Gütersloh und RW Ahlen separates themselves torlos.
Red White Ahlen continues on the spot.
The FC Gütersloh also had only a 0: 0 draw.
The final light and the third final turns them out to be assembled in the Heidewaldstadion before 438 viewers.
The first half was obscure by the entertainment factor.
For this reason, anyone who wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst could not care about it.
There was no danger of missing a Torchance because there was practically no.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) torch of the entire game, Güterslohs Nick Flock recorded in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility was the Ahlener when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty limit.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
He had to be exchanged for injuries and Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel scored 18 metres above the housing and after an hour the freight slots also appeared offensive for the first time.
After a conquest of Matthäus Wieckowicz it went fix.
The swiftly presented Konter about Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a leap in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they moved with a headball from Wieckowicz (66.) to a corner ball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interimstrainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
There was nothing.
More than optical superiority, thanks to its own initiative, the Ahlener did not bring about.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but also that brought nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played at zero", but unfortunately the zero was also on the front.
"This time we were not as torical as we were against wood wrapping and that even though our opponent had no desire to play here", RW Ahlens said Interimstrainer.
Offensive "everything went so much" against a team that only wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not feel that we could get a counter-tor, 'says Daut.
However, as a spectator, he did not feel as though his team could shoot a gateway.
For that, the idea was too weak.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately, there are enough chalmers.
This is Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabausestelle for which these donations are intended.
The Honorary Officers assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky became bright blue, but the square was still slightly empty, but that should change during the day.
Because: "Here it is so nice sociable, so we are here today," said a visitor.
The organiser of the Festes Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper prise Humor.
For the couple of Brockmann, who should be woken up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough chalmers.
And the "replacement" was not allowed to entertain the increasing number of visitors in music between.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Simple", Marcel Kreimer joked.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to present the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many assets with their stands, including clubs.
"Actually, there should be something like a table", he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other fortresses that took place in September and the Clean up action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful touch - what goes on here.
Then the Maikranz of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was taken off with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarter.
Many stands have been worked for the physical well-being.
From sweetness to heart everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who lives in Reckenfeld only for one year, was creative at his décor.
Furnishes, beer lid with reckenfelder motiven and much more he had in offer.
A speciality offered three Reckenfelder Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a speciality.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cake.
The conviviality is that the visitors then left for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage programme that is not available at the autumn festival.
Schmier events with local political message: No successful advertising for skateboarding.
In Lengerich, unknown people have hardly promoted the construction of a skateboard.
In several places there are lubricants, Jürgen Kohne says from the city council on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been charged with charges of any kind.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are displayed on signs, including the Gempt-Halle and Alten Rathaus.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a correspondent letter was discovered at the staircase at the Gempt-Bistro trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently "just" left with an Edding, they could easily be removed.
"A few days later this was again there, this time open", says Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertisement must be replaced.
A special note is given in this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on on the.
If the skateboard is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
Promises have already been made, explained by Jörg Hesselmann from the urban field of school, sport and culture without name.
Well possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the approved table.
For years local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skateboarding.
After removing the old one at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began some time.
The Council, after all, advocated a majority in favour of the fire-fighting park.
However, too many factors seem to have opposed building at this point.
At the end of June, a U-turn followed.
The members of the main and financial committee voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then comes from the City Council.
He proceeds from a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Closer air traffic control bottlenecks are getting worse.
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm", said the head of the trade union of air traffic control, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known staffing force in European air traffic safety, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for next year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe is the market for fully trained pilots.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, for monitoring the upper German airspace, around one hundred people were missing.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various air traffic unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the Federal Republic, countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports come together to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, this will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German Air Safety Agency.
Maas once again made EU Commission guidelines for pilotage.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost and personnel savings in national air traffic safety have now fully integrated into the operational business.
Maas appealed to Bundesverkehrsminister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that do not keep the air off even further.
At present, the EU requirements would be voted on by 2024 and there are fears of further tightening.
The EU is subject to constant pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high costs of delay for airlines will lead to rethinking.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
The estimated admission of 120 pilots annually over the next five years to offset the age-related outputs.
The necessary staffing structure is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Consolidated Consolidated Financial Statements
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp-Interimschef Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at Sunday's meeting, the crisis-hit group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be an additional reduction in personnel beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two resignations, the supervisory body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of employees.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the company will be bundled with elevators and suppliers.
Barcelona: Violence at demos of policemen and Catalan independence advocates.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with many injured.
According to the city council, some 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 pro-independence demonstrators.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two Protests apart with a large ban.
However, according to the forces of force, independence advocates tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked officials with paint and sausages.
According to the figures, there were also some Protests among the participants.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police announced that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The policemen, with their demonstration, wanted to pay tribute to colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, opposed the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they called for better salaries.
Spanish police and Guardia Civil members find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn far more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it provocative that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come to protest?", the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency asked.
Only to provoke and celebrate the fact that they have ruined us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearics who only wanted to give his name to Daniel rejected the charge.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues had not come to provoke ", the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data from British ministers
A security gap in a mobile phone app has meant that the personal data of ministers and members of the British Conservative Tory Party were temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the tanks became known a day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises the best game: Ronaldos.
This evening the Portuguese star player played the best game together with half an hour of Valencia ", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after 3: 1 (1: 1) victory of the recorder against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the expensive star was also without its own gate the decisive man in the important game against the prosecutor.
"Ronaldo had much fun and makes it good," said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew up.
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early lag through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst persecutor for the time being.
The Real Madrid chartered Torjäger initially set up Mario Mandzukic, the former Bundesliga professional, who provided the lead with a double pack (26th / 49th)..
And Ronaldo, after a corner with headball, also provided the preliminary work to the meeting of Chief of Defense Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had only to push in front of the gate line.
"He gives many templates", the trainer praised.
However, Allegri also wants to see gates from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of record guards.
"We need to be even better in serving him", the coach asked.
Bester Juve-Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than EUR 100 million, the superpower of Juventus seems even more pressing.
Seven victories in seven games are the makellose series in series A. On 21 points, the master of the past seven years already has six meters ahead of Naples.
The table second, trained by former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after Mario Rui (58th), who had already rejected, was the top part.
The Portuguese had to go to hard entry against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the place.
"We played well against a good Naples", commented the Turiner Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel discussed.
The German national player prevailed at Juve..
The professional acquired by FC Liverpool was in use on all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions- League-Partie against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half-hour": Ronaldo was at 2: 0 victory of the Turiner and was locked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.

Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Endlich!
Get it!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply more grip, we have put him as well as never before problems ", according to the list of hoetmar footwear possibilities.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, so you can rarely make games positive.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) photo: Heinz Schwackenberg.
In the first passage, the SG also had only two possibilities, the first but used Maik Krause from sharp angles to the early leadership (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but he wouldn ’ t have moved to Krause after great work.
The host had only a double chance than Moritz Höne at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher failed, and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests were even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all gave.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had rescued with his hand on the torline and saw Rot - also could not use Niklas Eilmann for guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide secured the ball over the line, the game was decided (81st).
"We had criticized ourselves hard before, which was different from what happened in recent weeks," the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.

Fußball: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spektakelfußball in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3: 4.
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We have no access to it", he presumably meant the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites that appeared with collective offensive.
He could laugh anyway: "A dreadful victory," he said, forcibly cheered, and withdrew from daring players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Remember, after a duel of two teams, one of them, Albums to play the championship and the other, Albersloh, to fight the class.
Understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back to the 90 minutes behind him.
"This was by far our best season performance," he says.
"How we return to the 0: 2, how we are against one of the top teams of the league over the whole game time, that was really phenomenal".
It is all the more bitter that we must now go home with empty hands.
Top Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the host with his 12th season meeting in leadership (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2: 0 he placed on the left side of the page for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew this, but so a player can't be completely robbed.
"That was already madness, what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent's tense.
Shortly before the change of the side, his own Elf compensated: McGill ’ s move from the left blessed between Hövelmann and Concordia Torhüter Hinkerohe to the long Toreck (45.).
After the page change, it was again McGill who achieved the balance (59.).
After that, it went up and down.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked albums again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69).
In spite of a large number, Albersloh no longer succeeded in reconciling the last Concordia meeting (80th).
We must now concentrate fully on Wednesday.
"The game against Shapdetten, that is what we must win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1: 0 Zymner (24), 2: 0 Fröhning (39), 2: 1 McGill (45), 2: 2 McGill (59), 3: 2 Nübel (64.), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80.).

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by mid-next year.
Meanwhile, France ’ s president, Emmanuel Macron, has signaled that he personally want to collect the price of tolerance in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term was too short: as President of the Federal Republic he was not in Tutzing ’ s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest.
He was an academic director, Udo Hahn, when he proudly said: "All German presidents and Chancellor were already with us".

Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian news
"The musical cabaret with Tina Teubner was suitable for both adults and men on Friday evening in the Christuskirche hall in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret keeper, the gender understanding prevails, not only with humour and warmth for the (felt) woman and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used it and also mastered her violin.
On the wing, Ben Süverkrüp sat.
On the one hand, it is one of the male sparring partners, sometimes even until the end of the sentence, and on the other, a true pianist: however congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner, that some may have wanted a solo.
There were also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, as was the Red thread of the evening.
There, Teubner had put a paradox into play: the satisfaction of man comes when he has a partner, but he does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring.
The piano olo is now demonstrating the same thing: what would be the result of Mozart's composing, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrüp glides in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" in the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart g-Moll-Symphony in a playful dancing.
There were great applause and bravo from the full room.
Flowers handed over Karlheinz Kleintje, Treasurer of the Association, the Chansonette.
However, the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not receive any additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the duo a chance to perform in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

"Actually I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We did not get to grips with them, "says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But the angry was more about the many missed opportunities.
In the end, his team failed this time.
The ASG therefore ran behind almost until the end of a lag, for the break with 11: 12 and later with 15: 18 (45) behind.
Only at the end of the day did the broader bank of the host ’ s members become significantly noticeable.

About 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 he went with 25: 15 to the vice champion of the previous year.
Essen was accepted in the second place, but did not come into play.
We have done it well.
Our opponent has raised a high risk but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence, BSV already introduced the adoption on three levels at 12: 8.
We were unable to keep the pressure on the press.
Eating was a bit awesome, and we got a bit of lully, "says Münch.

International: Turkish Municipality: Opening Mosque as missed Chance
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the large Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The Mosque redeeming in Cologne has left a hereditary hereditary comeback in the German-Turkish relationship," said the Chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of side by side with German leaders emphasizing Muslims ’ membership of Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has encouraged 'many reservations'.
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself.
After the long summer break, Folk Time is finally back.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Memorial Association Nottuln already hosts its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the chamber of the Alten Amtmannei.
Almost on the day it is then a year ago that for the first time we conducted a film meeting.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "said Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our Folktreff was so fast in Nottuln eta.
No matter whether storm deep graveyard in January or heatwave in July, the Amtmannei fireplace room was always full.
"The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sea mannslides, folksongs, Evergreens and old headers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friendly musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer pledged his accordion to the first Folktreff- "birthday".,,.
He was a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, who played music with platGerman texts.
Now he is travelling with an Irish folk band.
The folktreffs ’ makers remember the last event in summer when Christoph Schulz sent the listeners to their home with an ear worm from the folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in the Night".

For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step towards the world ’ s largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority approved the planned merger, announced Linde on Sunday.

For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October so that the merger can succeed.
From pure fruit to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the association for gardening and land care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, an orchard in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus set the last foundation impulse for the association for horticulture and Landespflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
However, he was told differently at that time: when the Kulmbach City and Land District obstructionist Wilhelm Flessa was born in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit tree association also differed from today's work - in fact, it was purely about fruit growing, flowers and gardening that nobody thought.
"At that time, in the Enlightenment era, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his presentation.
Fruit trees should be lined by highways, so-called industrial gardens were created by schools.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play an equally important role as mediating knowledge, healthy nutrition, and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer Youth Group "Maulwürfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a garden building association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said Günter Reif, Chairman of the circle, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The chestnut collars were a huge matter for us children, I doubt that you can get a lot of pleasure with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the jubilee.
"Where they are to stand, the district association", added councillor Söllner and highlighted the special importance of the garden associations for the villages.
The association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many garden associations in the county has left no doubt about it.
He led the many visitors with a pictorial presentation through the long history of the circle association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was dosed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden turned into a garden of ornaments and gardens.
"Nature persists, it was there before us, and we must orient ourselves to it", the expert in fruit and nut trees pleaded.
For this reason, there is an incentive for the gardening associations not to let down so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
These include welcoming the new citizens in our clubs, the President of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the glaring decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the festival that was solemnly surrounded by the Turmbläsern of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada ’ s Secretary of State is moving UN speech
Mexico ’ s government wants clarity on Nafta: they are putting an ultimatum to both trading partners.
Canada ’ s Secretary of State now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and shifts her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the pressure of time in the struggle for a resurgence of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Secretary of State Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will speak only on Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, their spokesman, Adam Austen.
In the meantime, they are concentrating on the renegotiation of Nafta.
The Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the US would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement that has already been concluded between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August to recast the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new run have been going on for more than a year.
By Sunday evening (local time), they are now to be brought to a conclusion, and Trump ’ s government wants to present the agreement before 1 October to the US Senate.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico ’ s President-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro after a report of the daily newspaper O Globo, where he lives.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential election.
At the beginning of September, the politician was attacked on the street during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went on the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro in several Brazilian cities.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and frauen-despicable statements mobile.
In the economic metropolis of São Paulo, several thousand demonstrators were expected.
In Brazil ’ s capital, protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers ’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to twelve years' imprisonment for corruption, and therefore cannot stand for election.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As former mayor of the million-city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro.
While Brazil's "Trump" has been involved in politics for a long time, it has recently been presented as an anti-system messenger.
None of the candidates in the first round is given an absolute majority, and there is a run-off on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from this - no matter who he takes up.
Bolsonaro is well known for being wary of homosexuals and blacks and the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again, he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that Lula ’ s left-wing Labor Party supporters should be shot down.
Europe ’ s Ryder Cup Title

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen reported on Larsen's website.
On the death bed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children.
Since the beginning of the year, the musician has been treated for prostate cancer.
Larsen was known with the band Gasolin ', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and Beatles.
After the release of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 until today is the most sold album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen, on Sunday, worshipped Larsen in a statement as' street young 'who was' against everything, but in all hearts'.
The head of the government also recalled that the monarchie opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 at the 70th anniversary of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: Volume to Presslufthammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and breed a concert with the power of a tiger".
After the sound check and just before the concert begins, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and surroundings - all together with the "Mosquito" Booking Agency from Oelde - with their bands vocal the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock shows.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with Frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to start the concert with the latest unknown pieces from his own pen and the CD that will soon be released.
In front of the stage, the band ’ s performance will be danced to a coherent and powerful interaction.
Although "adding" calls are not to be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to "Here We Stand".
The fact that Hardrock is not just Hardrock demonstrates guitar player Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" the synthesizer is used at "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only is the longing, almost ballad "Take Me Home" captivates by the change of melodic passages to the gitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, played a special role since its foundation in 2005.
Full agility presents the band on Saturday their hardrock.
The fact that "The Ignition", with its performances in front of a large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and incomprehensible.
Singers and guitarist Tim Jungmann, together with the band, also plays the only covert song of the evening, "Word Up" from Cameo from the 80s.
As soon as you feel even higher than before, guitar player Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo while running through the audience.
A certain volume belongs to genrebedingt bei ei ­ nem such Hardrock concert of course: At the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht lies, according to the mixed pult team at the "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibel.
This is, for example, the level of pressure hammer, but it is clearly below the controls of the 'Wacken-Fesitvals', to which 'The Ignition' refers on its website.
Ohrenbetäubende 120 Dezibel in Düsentrieblautstärke wie beim jährlichen Metal-Stelldichein im Norden der Republik üblich, braucht das Ahlener Publikum bei dieser Rocknacht indessen nicht.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher, rocky Gangart have long convinced their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saws and set up a concert table with the power of a tiger", all three groups, however transferred, can say at the end.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A Toter in Sailing Aircraft accident at Essen / Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Essen Airport.
In a car park at Mülheim Airport / Essen, a sailing plane crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near the airport Mülheim / Essen, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a sailing aircraft crashed at the airport's parking lot.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight crew was on board - the aircraft should be a one-seater.
The aircraft had already found itself at the accident point in the landing stage.
The crash site is only a short distance from a fixed tent on the airport premises.
But an October festival has been taking place this weekend.
The airport Mülheim / Essen is located on the city border of the two Ruhrgebietsstädte and directly on the motorway 52.

Trump himmelt Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that US President North Korea ’ s leader, Kim, is well disposed to despite the nuclear crisis, is no secret.
But Trump has now made a real statement of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kims' beautiful letters.
At the tender age of 72, the married US president became aware of a new flame.
The Tragic: It is a distant relationship.
In public opinion, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love on Saturday to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost bullying words for the half-old boss of Pyongyang ’ s ruler dynasties, despite the fact that the fight for North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament has turned out to be rather tough.
"I was tough, he was also, and between us it went and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the talks with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, it was great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the stump of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have seen little more than lip service.
That the affection for the infamous Rocket Man – Trump ’ s nickname for Kim – may not be upright for everyone, seemed well aware of the US president.
In any case, he immediately anticipated criticism of his performance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That is so imprecise.
But he did not care much about that, Trump declared, and then put his finger on the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential".
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there pushing into this stuffed arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.

Refugees Saved by Video from Libya ’ s
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic conditions of detention in Libya with a mobile video, enabling them to save.
The group had shot and spread the recording in its cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under the threat of life.
"You refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger of life.
One of his colleagues had been beaten almost to death by the attendants, Onyeka said.
Generally speaking, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: 'They all beat us with pipes and sticks'.
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the bar.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
Approximately 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homes this year with the aid of the programme, the IOM precher said in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
However, he has not heard from a handy-video helper.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libya ’ s refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the road from Africa to Europe.

Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has called for the rule of law in Turkey to be.
The relations between the two countries are currently overshadowed, "said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This relates above all to waves of arrest, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise themselves in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important precondition for this.,,, and.,,,,,, and,,,, and,, and,,
According to his own data, Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression will be respected.
Erdogan then reiterated the independence of Turkish justice.
In the short term, Laschet and Erdogan ’ s conversation was transferred to a building of the willingness of the Federal Ministry of Defense to fly at Cologne ’ s.
Originally it had to take place at Wahn Castle - but that was rejected by the castle owner from political persuasion against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel to Cologne to open the Ditib Mos.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
He said, 'The Muslims who go to these mosques are also citizens of our country'.
And we are also their contacts - not the Turkish President.
Failure to Trust the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump will not tire of emphasizing the success of the negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is a sober one.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea ’ s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula during the UN General Debate.
"The recent stalemate is that the US is building coercive measures that are lethal for confidence building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there is no way for us, as the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean Chief diplomat.
That punitive measures could bring North Korea to its knees is' a pipe dream of people who do not know us'.
To build confidence, however, his country has stopped nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, highlighted Ri.
However, the US side did not respond to this, and the minister criticized it.
Because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, last year alone, the UN Security Council adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pressing the United Nations over the past few days for strict compliance with punitive measures.
At the same time, the US government is working toward rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea ’ s leader, Kim Jong Un.
After the first Singapore summit, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will return to Pyongyang for talks on ending the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community.
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the open door HoT received nothing: white blankets and flower muck on the tables and a large buffet waited for guests after the harvest service.
Enchanted, the young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new.
It was funded by donations from the community, for which young people wanted to thank the food.
The launch with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalled.,,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were perfectly prepared for the big day.
But then came the bad surprise on the first day after the summer recess: a power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out, the food was spoilt and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from scratch: although we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, the children and young people wanted to do it alone," Westbuer said.
And so everyone packed.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Better can it not be better", a visitor was impressed, while Hokkaido-pumpkin soup was served, or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and adolescents have put on their feet", stressed the parish Frank Beckmann, while magicians Stephan Lammen made card tricks and other pieces of art astonishing.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board of Governors NRW of the Tafel
From frustration about criticism from one ’ s own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, left his post in the National Association.
Sartor became known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He resigned as Vice President of the NRW Tafeln in July, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I liked too many in my back.
The head of the NRW Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed an understanding of the dpa decision of his long-standing deputy.
Sartor took the harsh criticism with him.
"I can understand his move - people who did not know exactly why the Essener Tafel is doing so".
Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week because nothing changes", so Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized in the "world on Sunday" again criticism of colleagues from other tablets.
We should not take the approach 'without starving the people of the city'.
It is up to the state to ensure that people did not starve.
At a congress of the panels held in Berlin on Friday, Essen did not participate.
"He told me too much sweet jewellery," he said.
There are all the social fuzzi that criticised me so much at the time.

The Gladbacher, who was born with the Swiss Quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave twice a hand leadership, ended up playing 2: 2: 2 and are still waiting for a downward victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen with his second Bundesligator was responsible for Wolfsburg ’ s compensation for 1: 1.
Yann Sommer was powerless at 20 metres of the Aargauer, as was the second counterpoint after an hour.

After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already took the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, some 1.8 million citizens are now voting on whether their country's name should be changed in North Macedonia.
Yes, the nearly three decades of conflict with Greece ’ s neighbors could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a change of name because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any rapprochement with the West.
Voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in a positive outcome to the referendum.

SPD politicians: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave their name to Jawort on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership was not questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right", he has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old cadre is the SPD federal budget spokesman and one of the spokesmen of the hake region, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused a rage on June 30, 2017.
For example, he accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of being "locked" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental proclamation of the DDR border by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexual marriages.
Prior to this, they had been able to register their partnership for life since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example when it came to adoption law.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Garden Day: 400 meters Hecke cut cut cut
There was a lot of work before the members of the Civil Society Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprakunde.
Because about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for around 12 supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs", the chairman of the citizens' association, Walter Schröer.
And it has accumulated so much.
Because of the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is only a formal cut.
As early as the spring, the hedges have already been shot.
The breakfast is always a long tradition.
"It is also meant to remain with all the forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner gets gold at the Kanuslalom-WM
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Kanuslalom World Cup in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-olds set a perfect course at the Olympia track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympia bronze by three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, had already enough journeys here at the facility, and today it has pampered everything, "said the Olympic third in London 2012.
He threw his paddle away with joy and frightened both arms to the height - knowing well that it would suffice for at least one medal.
After all, he had a starting number four.
But the six remaining starters could not topp his fable time of 89.69 seconds.

The police inspectorate Gauting is reporting the first attempt at burglary at this autumn into a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days will be shorter - they want to use burglars again.
The police inspectorate, Gauting, reported yesterday the first attempt at a burglary at this autumn.
It is thanks to the alarm that it has remained at the Königswieser Straße in trying to find a family house.
After all, it went without when the perpetrators laid hand on Friday just before 20 o'clock.
The burglars knew that the inhabitants were not at home.
The alarm, however, apparently surprised her so much that she took flight without prey.

Pleite at Hertha: Asked for reality: Bayern versus Ajax.
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not want to let the FC Bayern "fall.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim ruling for Niko Kovac ’ s term.
The first small performance models under the new Coach Niko Kovac should not increase for Munich at any rate to the greater lower lower down.
"A week ago we had the impression that we are invisible.
Now we got a bit of the reality, "said Thomas Müller after the earned 0: 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and asked for a reaction for the Champions-League-Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us is aware that this is a real irritation and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year out, no own gate was shot, as at the same time as the pre-season two compulsory games in series without victory, the table leadership in the football league lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
The overall situation is not as dramatic as the final stage of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its elaborate Mann-gegen-Mann-Taktik and the Berliner by their playful needle sticks over the outside delivered two blueprints within three days, just as the last over-powerful Bavaria is to be cracked.
"The people who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we will do everything we can to ensure that we succeed again," said Kovac.
Otherwise, with his losers in his birthtown, he went surprisingly gently, and pushed his first defeat as Munich coach only to the yet again flawed approach to opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nonetheless make the first stopover in his term of office a positive one - otherwise the tone will probably worsen.
Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second class performance of this season after 2: 0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second championship against Ajax, which was also sovereign for the start of AEK Athens with 3: 0.
"Now we caught up in two games, but we will also make our goals again," said national team paper Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost Cup finals against Eintracht Frankfurt, Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly.
The legal defender appeared in the role of Mahner.
"I do not believe that all this is bad, we also have to work out it again, because we do not make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes at the back", said the 23-year-old just before departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bavaria even had five counts behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with one point.
And so, with an eye-fork, Kimmich at least appreciated that the public debate on supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has ended.
"Yes, that is already good," said the national player.
It is good for the League.
DFB-Boss in Schusslinie: Özil-Causa: Sharfe attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, the Turkish President, Erdogan, denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel may see mistakes, but defends the association slinie.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation of Mesut Özil in the Permanent Strait.
After the Turkish President criticised the handling of the former World Champion in Germany, the DFB chief defended the Verbandslinie in order to open the big Ditib-Mosque in Cologne.
At the early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by Özil in the Mainzer ZDF- "Sportstudio" announced consequences from Causa.
"We need to draw very precise conclusions in future - because we also have many migrants' backgrounds in the U-teams - that this is something that is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as further integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan was not in favour of the values of football and the DFB.
It had denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in harsh terms.
Our born and raised Mesut Özil in Germany and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they could photograph with me in England, "said Erdogan on Saturday in the city.
To be honest, as its President, I could not digest the fact that our two young men who have risen to the German national team were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, contrary to Özil after the World Cup affair, which had begun by photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt "sensibly treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face up to players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German when I lose, I am Migrant - that is not possible.
"That he has such an impression, I very much regret," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, as I have always said.
But he does not see any basis for Özils ’ return to the national team.
As a consequence, besides the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration commissioner will be appointed.
"If there is a clear effect on society and football without a background of migration, and says:" The subject is important, we must take care of it ", which would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to stand again for the post as President of the DFB next year.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes," said Grindel.
Infant builds three accidents within three hours.
Coburg / Rödental - As the police reported, the 75 year-old caused accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 13 p.m.
The 75-year-old driver was first mentioned by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
He told the pensioner that he had gone against her car.
But there was no exchange of staff, as the 75 year-old was unable to find the lady in the car park.
A short time later, a telephone message was sent to the police about a car driver who would have escaped from the road and had been driven against a head cost.
The man did not want a local police force and then went on.
Then the Romans went home.
However, the pensioner has proceeded in his place of residence in which he has lived for decades and when a vehicle was turned.
After all, the police could find him and stop.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75 year old made a confused impression and could not make any sense to many more.
The damage is approximately EUR 1300.

Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the hoped-for referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state began.
Some 1.8 million voters should decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of neighbouring Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO.
If the people vote 'yes', they will also give the starting signal for their country's western integration.

It is estimated that 15 percent of Swiss citizens have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only five percent of the cases will find a card at the decisive moment in possible donors.
In more than 60% of the talks, relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"They must then decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," Always.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health card, as the spokesperson in the Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - per or contractually - for organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be regarded as organ donors unless he or she contradicts members.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.

In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Greetings were already there two years ago when 14 years ago in Bielefeld.
With terms like superhirn, genius or miracle child, organizer Laue can do little.
"Headcount can be trained", he said.
Many participants spent several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium computing competitions.
One of the disciplines, for example, is square root draw from six figures.
When it comes to versatility, the candidates get surprises for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, Germans would have good opportunities, as the main referee said.
Otherwise, Asians are often to the advantage, because they have learned more intensively in early childhood and with other effective methods.

Polare Kaltluft brings new snow to the west on the mountains.
Mrs Holle shakes her beds in the West for the first time next week: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snow limit drops at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it could cut down to about 1,000 meters in intensity.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, it is possible to expect from 20 to 40 centimetres of Neuschnee above 2,000 metres.
On higher-lying passways (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions will therefore be wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual sticker maintenance on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein ’ s peasants are allowed to start the annual sticking maintenance on Monday.

Knicks, as a corridor, scattered habitats that can still function through the exchange of organisms, as the Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) said in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are Living fences
The Knicks were driven by a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fences, they also supplied firewood and beams for their specialist houses.
From that time, his name "Knick" also comes from: "Umknicken" the branches could develop the dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, around 45 000 kilometres of hedges are stretched between the North and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a large and varied landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a spare space for around 7000 species.
In one kilometre of knees, up to 1800 different species could live and brew up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only be achieved if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise it becomes a light series of trees which, besides biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the Knickpflege can only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesians talk about SItuation on site.
The local Radical Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquake and tsunami in the interview with the German editorial network (RND):
Have you been there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta just on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid supplies can also be flown.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have arranged something provisionally where we have accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are curious about the surrounding hills, where they still stand out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some hold up in front of their homes, and there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and petrol stations are completely closed, people are sometimes watching food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down, and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partially free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information supply work on the island?
At the moment, we have a handful of things, but before that it did not work and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people from whom they do not know whether they are living and where they are residing because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but, for example, on work.
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warnings came, many "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they are curious about the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Fire Ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
But, every day there are earthquakes, but that was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuation.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a great many people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Investigation in Turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With a FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the clumsy majority for Kavanaugh ’ s controversial judges ’ nominees, who have been contested for the plight.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline by Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that occurred more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh ’ s cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor of Christine Blasey Ford, during which the jury ’ s riots against opposition democrats, the Senate ’ s Justice Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the conservative judge of the Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his initial announcement, that he would agree, but demanded a FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who described Thursday's serious allegations as a 'complaint', initially contained further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of 'happiness in the accident'.
In this way, last doubt could be resolved, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump attacked Democrats sharply because they reject Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy".
Trump ordered FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
You will specifically investigate the well-known allegations of two women, more not, said a government representative of the Wall Street Journal: "They do not go to a fishing trip".

There is also the federal school centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Fear has been felt.
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
However, Mainz also played a role in time.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball inside.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penal room, "said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathe.
After all, the Königsblue was still able to bring the scarce 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over the time and thus the first season victory under the roof.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership of Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of chief trainer Domenico Tedesco security had given Tedesco: "In sum, the first half time was good, both playful and Pressing".
Cream really no headball-monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours", says Heidel: "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand it".
The guys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore they were pulling it further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Creator, who did not have an insignificant part with his headball-match: "I am actually the worst headballer player in the man".
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start a firework in the early stages and make it a firework," said Schalkes Chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to approach lots over 90 minutes.
The biggest shortcoming in the afternoon: Royal blue missed it to worry about clearer conditions.
After all, the possibilities were there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the Latte 59th / 72nd or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have become a quotation victory", said Tedesco: "You have already felt fear a bit".
I am therefore pleased that we have won.
This was not the only sound.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion on equal terms.
The author, Professor Doktor Aladin El-Mafaalani, is facing them.
He has once again followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my job to get interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association cooperating with the alliance "Cultural Policy".
El-Mafaalani rises very loosely at reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject intelligently.
With a lot of gestures, solid figures and one or other joke, he brings one of the most conflicting issues closer to listeners: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are there growing conflicts?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At a table, German society, at the cat table, is sitting the first generation migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be on the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat on the big table and now want to take part.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not crucial whether political or left-wing, but: 'Do I support or against an open society?'.
Initially, rather than behaving, the discussion round is always running out.
And there is a need for talk.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with pupils.
El-Mafaalani is on stage, not on stage, a symbol of discussion: it is on an equal footing.
Sociology professor does not urge his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of average, not of individual destiny.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because 'only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions', says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session, he has also discussed an open ear for the questions of guests and also in the foyer, prepared Kurdish specialities.

Schalke's Naldo "Big Sport" also succeeds on the bank.
For the third time in a row, Naldo does not thank Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues spent the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange-bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two meters of Brazilians had rightly spoken the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after 1: 0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 as usual, and when chief trainer Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who called all the simplest half Naldo, said: "We have to thank trainers!"

Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that we can get all the time through.
And that we all keep in the boat, "said Tedesco caught the rotation, which last also caught Naldo.
And the Brazilians responded with the wisdom of their advanced age: by acting on the bank as an exemplary team player.
In August, Austria ’ s industry ’ s atmosphere accelerated its downturn compared to the eurozone.
The PMI shopping managerindex stood at 46.7 points on a 37-month.
Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands on Monday, the Markit Institute informed its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still 13 months after the mark of 50 meters which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry scored 50.9 points in August.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points) were.
In Germany, France, and Spain, the ballot barometer fell more slowly than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level in March at 44.0 points.
"The slightly slowed downturn may mean that the worst survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry - at least in the third quarter - remains the number one growth bra.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as much as they did since November 2011.
For this reason, companies set up posts for the seventh month in succession.
In China, too, industrial production fell more than initially assumed in August.
The Stimmungsbarometer sank from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts first expected 47.8 points.
The Shopping Managerindex relies on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Amongst other things, the developments in sales, employment, camps and prices will be raised.
