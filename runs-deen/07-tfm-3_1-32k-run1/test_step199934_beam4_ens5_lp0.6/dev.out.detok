Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city.
It is an error where young people are to meet.
A mine chapel, where now is digging for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former reason of peasants.
Munich ’ s oldest official map promotes exciting stories.
It nerves when maps are not up to date.
Everyone who had to get up because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historic maps of the Bavarian Atlas digital Bayern-Atlas, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the State Government, are far from current - yet for this reason.
Especially if you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be recognized as such.
More detailed maps have been incorporated into the large map of cities and municipalities.
According to Bayerischer Vermessmessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and originated from Bayerns ’ first measurements.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical recording of Bayerns, for military purposes.
Although the French troops eventually departed with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian card.
Kurfürst Max IV, Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographische Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische VerMeasurement Management.
The Urposition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found like any other on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison of the former / Today is the most striking example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is sub-sendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, when Munich's district.
Today Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today ’ s Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of Bavaria ’ s uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, nothing can be seen as fields - at first glance: a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered pieces from the so-called "primeval photo" from which the base tax was derived.
Small parcels are no longer evidence of farmers - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 site of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow - not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urposition sheet, the area of the current Au-Haidhausen district, not only reads the street name "at Gasteig" or from the height "on the lilies" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with madness.
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften".,.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the anchor of the so-called mistakes.
He has also banned staff from using violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked on the Anstalt for an.,,.,,.,.. and...,..
For 280 patients the first had been room, later to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circular irrenance in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar Amper Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrists.
Young people in the Munich Salesianum are now on the premises of the former Auer Anstalt.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies.
The TSV Munich East is the football pitch of TSV Munich East, east residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children house "Casa Don Bosco", built in the architectural style of the irrigation building that had been destroyed in the Second World War.
Marienplatz was recorded as "Haupt Platz" in 1856, the Kaufinger Strasse "Kaufinger Gasse".
Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allied bombs in December 1944.
A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a mine chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the spate stich for the second S-Bahn line.
With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with today's aerial image - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the Missouri State, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missouri to pay particular attention when travelling through the state and to take extreme care, because a number of dubious, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are recorded here," says the group's opinion.
A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as state law enforcement authorities, which disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warning.
"They have breaches of civil rights that people happen.
They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
'We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not yet heard. '
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during the journey through the state and was taken custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points out a recent report by the Missouri General Office of the Public Prosecutor, which shows that black drivers in the state are subject to 75% more frequently than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees inform what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
'People must be prepared, whether they bring deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state. '
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI Hasscrime report, which classify the state in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigrant offences, which, ACLU believes will contribute to further race profiling..
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaun Project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU MEPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on the ground.
At the court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members.
Markus Schwendemann gave insights into his business, where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, providing 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, the 'Black Forest milk' is an alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, as sisters.
The guests ’ table is exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaun project as "elementary importance".
I cannot make profitable on such steep areas.
The green area for a lot of work, much needs to be done with Motorsense.
"We have to fight with the conditions and topography", said Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parental plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not run organic.
For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is pleased with the Leader promotion".
At the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this would lead to the reforestation of land for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and who think about how to get their farm," said the mayor said.
Farmers are often criticized for promoting the promotion of farmers.
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.
The surface is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be explored until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was promoted over Leader, a quarter of Fischerbach.
Thus, farmers remained EUR 12 610 million they had to invest in 16.2 km of willow fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of fences", explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a good job, without farmers and rural women is not going to go '.
Peter Weiß said: "Best food is produced here".
The Landscape Courts (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of Weidefenfenfenfences.
The aim is to open up the Black Forest.
The prerequisite is the existence of a funding backdrop referred to by the LPR.
In addition, the fencing area must not be manageable (increase over 35%) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the request of eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.
The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred?
Now, Trump ’ s White House is Prevention of Liberty
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans, like any other – so the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein ’ s stronghold in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologists, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the statue of freedom.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A Horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have recalled him if he had done so.
But he attacked its importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when Emma Lazarus ’ s famous poem in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller Acosta said: "I do not want to go into a complete thing about history, but the statue of freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.,,.,,.., and..,., and...
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom. '
Miller is correct, but, as he himself said, it is not really a matter of history.
It is about contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only to any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: 'Your moses, your poor, / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the wretched waste of your rich coasts'.
There was never a time when the 'elding waste' was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US.
This conflict because of the importance of statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict over America ’ s meaning.
Lazarus - and her friends who sought to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a used classic visual representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: mother of exiles.
The poem ’ s connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wing wanted to change it for a long time.
The great shrine Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the statue of freedom is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.
It is supposed to wear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not pave the way to the United States'.
Limbaugh has found a little unusual here.
The importance of statue is entirely a question of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, wretched but hopeful people after long and often dreadful journeys on the decks.
It is a real question of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and goodwill they have to hear..,.,....,..,.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch is not to enlighten the path, but to inflict hatred that is its only source of power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK Team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team.
The UK ’ s performance director of athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will "make a massive contribution to the.
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that 'something special is developing in Scotland' and the UK's athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it out," said Black.
"I am talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletic: it has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. '
Several Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected to team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Your captain speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought about were great. '
The Commonwealth Silver medal, which will take place in the fifth World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven to be reached in 1983 and 2015.
Muir ’ s medium-haul runner along this path and established five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m trucks.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that had won the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot was in Team Lee McConnell.
The team paper says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team, but in some cases, also medals and finals.
"The special thing about being team capitalism is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me, it makes something very special for me", she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise on podiums.
As regards my speech as captain?
Yes, I think it went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there. '
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don ’ t get a public office if you can ’ t heap voters ’ heaping voters if you cannot heed voters ’ heed.
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He sent criticism, safe.
But he has not silenced his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said: 'Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are being slaughtered like sheep.'
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogan ’ s staff blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
That is why the American Civil Liberties Union accused him at the beginning of this week.
The governor ’ s staff removed the complaint as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?".
"It is just Facebook," many people said.
But it is important.
And it is particularly important if it is a type like hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation ’ s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect to his voters and playful head to chemotherapy on his side.
That is why blocking people who come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum called officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions, arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hated people who swing the stick online.
The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a parish, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profan..,,..,..,..,.
The parish cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith...,..,..,...
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast "The Post".
"I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people comment on the same subject, they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected '.
What the governor ’ s employees described as "concentrated spam attack" would probably call "advocacy".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in previous times if you had done the same that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or arrest and silence protesters.
But that is precisely what is happening digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is charged by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated First Amendment, according to US District Court James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable porto had a similar effect to the Internet.,,.,..,.,..,.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter letters entered into his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
People who used pseudonyms like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions.
Petitions criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, Trade, and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project online Papers.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are part of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Northern Ireland, which led to the final round of the Archerfield links to the final round before losing against Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieved his fame," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry has done a great job when he established this place.
He is a keen champion of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great storefront for this course. '
The English Eales looks forward to defending a championship for the first time, even though he won his 32-year career at both the European Tour and the European Challenge.
"This really feels very special," said the player in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend Extremadura Open because it was taken from the program in the year after I won it.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate. '
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to home.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man of Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed it again and I played a solid golf.
I am glad how things have gone. '
With the trio in the field, former master winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the car park costs £5 per car with one occupancy and £10 per car with two or more occupants.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Less lung cancer through passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking.
This result is researchers from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
In comparison, he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994.
At that time there were 400 lung cancer deaths in Germany due to passive smoking per year.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Closures prove very complex
The construction work in the Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are some times", says the head of the Bauhofs Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, since there is much hidden in the underground, which is not reflected in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly obstructs construction work is a major problem for Stumpp construction.
"The ignorance of drivers before red traffic lights and locks is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road is closed and only buses are allowed to travel.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were pretty exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia ’ s Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a herd.
It rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai rainship in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweetpotato - locally called "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the recommended bones will be taken away and wrapped with freezing, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the Lehmboden - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as wash clothes from the nearby swamp.
An egg in an outside space serves as a Latrine.
As the youngest of her husband ’ s four wives were not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many are drinking hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around after 5 p.m.", she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was accepted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by public handing over to the occupying forces.
An existing movement that incited independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part in the eastern part of the.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morph 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and shaft roofs converted into different yellow brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans honored a God called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We were not accustomed to wearing these clothes," says Degei and points to her lively, handwoven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"In the past we had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
By 2015 alone, Freeport lost $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
Moreover, Papua has an estimated USD 78 billion of wood resources.
But these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a stifling presence.
An investigation in 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units had nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden Gans and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed, and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua ’ s tribal land in the 1970 ’ s became genocide in accordance with the Asian Human Rights Commission., and.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" in a 2016 report by the Erzdiocese Brisbane, which contains reports of previous year's atrocities, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, because every week incidents occur," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian press for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified, as Papua ’ s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javanesian warfare products sell fried chicken and gado Gado, a mixed vegetables with natural nusssauce.
Local people are fighting to keep here.
"The migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura.
'It cost the indigenous Papua - the Mama Mama [the women] of Papua - their market '.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts have broken, because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Jokowis ’ s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke down on a motorcycle.
The shocked children told them that they should turn their spotlights on.
One of the soldiers took up their tone and came back with four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunt and beat the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commando center to demand justice.
They performed ceremonial hunting arches and performed Waita dance - in the circle and a bird singing imitating - from Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldier was sent to an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot dead," it says in an official document of TIME that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home.
Nobody was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired", he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and studied his body to ensure that he was it," said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only bears a name, the TIME in gloomy mood.
'I saw that he was dead... I got it. "
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers only wanted "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
'It is about life and death '.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only the following day.
Three weeks ago, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it will no longer happen," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to go through ', he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, 'everything is regulated by law', he said.
Wiranto, who accused the UN for 'crimes against humanity', who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody vote of independence in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been resolved in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims received such allegations with grim disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
'I am tired '.
He says that he still lives in fear years later.
"I am afraid," he says.
'I am afraid to be arrested by the military is afraid of being shot. '
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military looked for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Regulated villagers protested before the company ’ s site office.
The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot and killed one.
"We were so panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge", says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witness how the injured were delivered quickly, so the TIME.
'I hid myself two days in my house '.
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers to account and withdraw the police mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been an unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, claiming to defend Papua's rights by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrary custody, under the pretext of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as far as possible.
The people here build everything they eat: Nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can edit four or five fields of sweeteners.
They retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between indigenous Papua and the new migrants, who have reached greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to manage their own businesses competitive.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money", says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai triai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting remain tense to international media.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, despite the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowis ’ s promises to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized..
"There are new threats to foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the 'various and widespread injuries' in Papua including the Paniai foundry.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta: 'There is still a democratic system in Indonesia, and there are free media, so it is difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights cases.'
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local residents broke their silence and afflicted him "We want freedom", according to a source that also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai Committees," says Gobai, Chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, the Paniai people are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he has to pay back.
"They do not need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai victims led to a last symbolic act of the troll: the victim ’ s body was buried on a territory precisely against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with sinked head.
'What else can we do? '
Fire capture the Dubai 'Torch' skyscrapers for the second time
A fire found on Friday in one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meters high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower (torch tower) in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We have slept and we have stood up with fire alarm and shouting people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor ", a resident who told his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that fire-fighting units at 4.00 p.m. local time (00.00 GMT) broke the fire and cooled the building.
The government said that it is working to provide accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of high houses around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from dressing, exterior coverings for decoration or insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said they believe that the system of plates to isolate and conceal at the London Grenfell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has fallen through his large Davis-Cup-Coup Coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal to play Davis-Cup-individual only on two winning points was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The fifth category classics, which are often very long, but also for that reason, are still very much appreciated.
63.54% of member states voted in favour of reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change in order to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, "said Haggerty.
We will continue to work to improve the application.
Not until the vote had come to the vote, after many of the objections, the proposal to put the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: the finalists at the Davis Cup and Fed Cup Cup will in the next year in the next year.
In order to reduce the costs of the organizers, the requirements for training places, etc., and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US passengers brings banned items to the aircraft, find a poll poll.
A survey conducted by air passengers revealed that more than 20% deliberately or unconsciously banned items are passed at the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points, including at least 6% that involved the aircraft while accidentally forfeited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1% claimed that they had discovered late that they were mistaken with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey carried out by more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that younger travellers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of those respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that was banned by TSA, 19.7% were millennials, compared to less than 15% that were members of generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed on to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% admitted that they had knowingly carried items with blades through security control, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft.
The company said that it has consulted travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport safety and how many would have deliberately done.
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to wear smuggling goods - knowingly or ignorant - were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain what liquids they may take or how much of it.
So it is no surprise that the largest quantity of liquids confiscated by TSA are.
For a while, the people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn ’ t matter: tens of thousands of Tesla ’ s Order
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
In doing so, he has failed to suggest that some of the customers has withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a different, less glaring figure: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk had often promoted the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Musk admits that 63,000 pre-orders have been withdrawn, 63,000 have.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these were only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 euros (in the US and 1000 pounds in the United Kingdom).
Currently 455,000 such non-committal reservations, Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts.
But the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12% of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 it should be - all models taken together - 500,000, 2020 a million.
The demand is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are available every day.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla is able to run its nagel-new production lines never tested in practice without.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
If there are more delays, however, the unbinding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
For then, the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from going out in the host.
EPA leader Pruitt is withdrawing because of the Obama Era ’ s rules to reduce emissions of emissions.,,,,.,,,.,.
A day after he was charged by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce smog emissions of smog poll..,,.
Pruitt presented the change when its agency proved more responsive to the needs of government environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint raised against his previous post in a federal court.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for one year to give his authority more time, study the plan and avoid 'interfering in local decisions or hinder economic growth.'
Pruitt, who was public prosecutor of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump ’ s appointment, had long been a staunch opponent of tougher environmental legislation.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulation that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitt regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA manager exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanleakage.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn in ozone standards would simply reinforce the EPA ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of fulfilling the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activists and others, and in an agreement the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority we have. '
Nevertheless, the EPA's opinion said that Pruitt will at some point use his "power to delay and any other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "are based on sound policy and the best available information '.
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had accused the EPA this week, said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important benefit for health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems among vulnerable groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Representatives of public health care and environmentalists complained about Pruitts ’ surprising change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure it needs to take this reasonable step from the responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration ’ s ideological crusade to attract polluters and their special interests'.
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church of St. Hil.
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m..
Whether it ’ s idyllic location and beautiful views of the town, the historic St. Hilari complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz-Serade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The conservation and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters of Tumlingens.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village jewel".
In 1267, the St. Hilari Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergisches Urkundenbuch: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
The text of the document stood on the Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, also a ruling court, which belonged to the church or the patron law and not vice versa.
People also lived there.
As emerges from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, besides the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the dominant settlement centre of the village.
Old maps of the year 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.
The patronage right was born from the early medieval right of the church.
A Lord who built, equiped a church and occupied with a parish remains the owner of this church and could inherit this church.
This was the right to use a parish or to propose a new parish to the bishop.
Three altars were in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two crushed on Christmas 1673.
The newly acclaimed bell was then first in 1692 but had to be handed over to later during World War II in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were insulated and stolen the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was dark.
In 1796 French troops were located near the church.
They broke out the chancellor church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilari cehof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church was broken.
Only the church tower was left.
In the New Year's snacht in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collap..,,.,.,.,..,..
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken.
Only the Turmzwerg which still exists today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen Renters" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.
As organizers, the friends and promoters Tumlingens invite to the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
This is developed by the Combo des Kepler-Gymnasium of Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Previous Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Registration is from 3.30 p.m.
For the end of the Serenade, a Umtrunk takes place in front of the graveyard.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers will reveal the fantastic views.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilari facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and promoters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini.
Association wants to check the approval of windmills.
"Boisheim defends" does not see a legal precondition for construction and has therefore turned to the Council.
The association "Boisheim defends" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.
It has been illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbine Nette Boisheimer Nette, no wind turbine could have been approved at all, since a wind power centration zone at the time of fours, only.,,.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "conservation" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, but the city of Viersen had not approved the Dusseldorf district government because of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of planning law, the approved approval certificate remains unlawful and therefore also to withdraw", said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim defends himself"..
The current state of affairs: the City Council has once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, before the summer recess; approval by the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This is why the granting of permission for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning '' '.
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received at the Viersen district since last week," said a spokesman.
The circle takes it as an opportunity to examine the matter again.
However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle did not wish to express its content on the argument of the association "Boisheim defends itself".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200 metre wind wheels on an area at the Boisheim Nette.
Last year, the company in which the city of Viersen had entered fours with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares.
The four wind turbines are designed to meet the power needs of around 11 400 households - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park in Aachen, as well as participating in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg County.
Car and tractors crack together: Mrs dies in the terrible accident.

City and traders are planning "Home Shops" Weekends "
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region should rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to shopping in the city centre.
As the Chairman of the Trade Association, Christian König, announced, the "home shoppers" weekend will make customers aware of what offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
The shops of the city centre are also to invite you to the "midnight shopping".
The action aims not only to residents of the city and the region.
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, so Christian König.
City Administration and Commercial Association are cooperating with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry..,,., and...,.,..
This means that the Commercial Association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive downtown" project.
This includes new offers, such as the first "Active Day" to the Brunnenfest and sold Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential needs to be reopened or re-opened.
These include tourists and tourists.
However, many locals would have lost sight of the city when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to reviving the city centre, to landlords, businesses throughout the city and clubs.
It had to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly spread, King said in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen informed that five Thuringit cities are participating for the first time in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and lead cherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities," says Streich.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his own direct environment.

Trump pressured by phone calls Mexico Mexico to pay the Border Wall Wall
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The President of the United States has denounced him for publicly denouncing the wall, and he said to him: 'You cannot tell the press'.
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the US southern border and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US would be "ridiculous," bad "and" stupid "and" stupid ", and that the insistence on the trade conveyed by the Obama administration would make him look like a depp, after proposing a ban on resettlement of refugees to the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after Mr Turnbull, 'that is the most unpleasant call for all day.'
Moore Ford Massacre: Activists revive racist Lynchakt as a call for justice justice.
A 1948- Ford Mercury went through a group of viewers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumped on the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns to block his way.
The leader of the Mob - a middle-age man in a needle suit - took a long train in his cigar and looked at through the windscreen.
Drinks floated in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!".
'Get him out of the car! '
Schrey torn the silence when a young black man was dragged by the front-passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene played on 22 July is only a hint.
But when a nose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone came out very real sickness.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night, in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were recalled by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever accused of murders.
"It is really incomprehensible that in all these years, no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organise the rendition.
'It is a jewel on a story, but it is a burden on our souls'.
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a civil rights activist.
It is a dramatic appeal for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
'We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice '.
A medical doctor places a beggars on the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford synch on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been indicted.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom, a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly for a woman.
Brooks said that the rumour was in the city that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from prison and approaching Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and obscured the identity of witnesses'.
Brooks makes it even more concise.
"It was an electoral right massacre," he said.
'They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and when you vote, then that will happen here'.
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual replica of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.
Their presentation is vivid, intriguing and is based in a kind of deep racism, many of which want to believe is no longer in America.
It is difficult to look and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We do not want to talk about lynching, because we will be confronted with its severity in all of us," she said.
"But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done.
The samples for this year ’ s production began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - pushed into a room and heard when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is the co-director of Greenes.
He has played the role of Chief Clan member for years, but he said that the role would never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I am not so," said Marbaugh.
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to those times'.
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their.
The piece begins with Malcom, who attacks Hester and afflicts him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
'I said n --- he, vanish from my property! '
Rascona responds fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) in laughter.
Greene is lautest.
"What?!", Rascona asked.
It is alarmed and confused.
Was I too tough?
"No", Greene said, still kicking.
'I simply do not think that white people at the time 'n --- he said'.
"But", one of the other black actors.
"You only have to meet the hard 'R.'.
And that is where energy is shifting in space, a sense of camera replaces the unease.
Everyone is concerned about getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it strongly and forcefully.
No one laughs.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There are shoe, shots and then silence.
A woman with a grief is above the body of the actor and carries out Billie Holidays's mourning praise "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks with each second word.
About a hundred meters behind a group of about four dozen viewers glide sweat and tears.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple is made from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many people just come down.
They have experienced Georgian fierce moisture every nearly eight hours when Brooks leads them to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to that point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch killings took place, the air feels cur.
When the last notes of the song ends, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children raise their heads, register the falsified blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other.
"They are not really dead", murs a small boy as if he would remember it.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over.
The actors throw away the Lynch part and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her poor, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks down with him.
"It is okay", whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did so for one reason '.
Later, the audience joined with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white pair of Atlanta, inspired by a black pair that they have just met.

Max Menge works as a Volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Number: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I worked at school in the open whole day.
What are your experience with this?
quantity: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum I see here.
I have to do with different people, young people, refugees and young adults.
They are now 26 years old, so they are a volunteer...,..,...,. and.
How is that?
crowd: I made Abitur.
And then a construction engineer study, say, successfully broken down.
I realised that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else, working with people.
And then I wondered what do you do.
If a social year, there is a glimpse, you can see how it really is on the ground, perhaps at the heart.
And was it so?
Quiet: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.
I will probably study dual, do a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It is probably always the case where you do its FSJ.
It can be done from age home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
I was very varied.
I was also partly in the UCS, in other words in the afternoons.
For me, that was exactly the right thing I had to do.., and.
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really is.
Unlike in the construction engineer?
Quiet: It is not a question of calculating statics.
There are other people who have a very different story behind each other.
Whether a refugee, whether a young person who has been taken out of the family - one must always be addressed individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no concerns?
Number: I am not the type.
It is an area that has a lot.
Much love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but this is how life is.

A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured, announced a NATO declaration.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the Qarabagh district.

Nato says that the explosion was on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a 'improvised explosives'.
The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the Bagram airfield in Bagram airfield.

The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people, with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since the US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.

EPA Returns to Delaying the Smog Rule
The US Environmental Protection Agency has repealed a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration that states are obliged to contain smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states complaining about the move.
The EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called 'ozone provisions 2015', and said that it shows the Agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners," said EPA CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's intention to measure the ozone rules - in which pollutants should be measured in a part of the country in order to establish where cuts need to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the Colombia district, filed a complaint on Tuesday, saying that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to cut back a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump Trump is supposed to boost economic growth.
But efforts have triggered the setback of Democrats and nature conservation groups that worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Community Area wants Community Area
In the end, the decision was clear: two votes against the Fluorn-Winkel Municipal Council decides to set up a Community area in the future Senior Residential Houses.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing part has been signed, mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
Although it will still take until the parish area of the parish so far is in the municipal council, there is no longer any planning hindrance for the project to be stemming from a private investor.
There is a discussion on a Community area.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square metres of surface for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council is that such a common area not as a meeting place only for the residents of the seniously living, but open into the community.
As an example, the word from the "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which was pre-determined by the allocation of funds to the current budget last autumn will be provided by means of funding.
The construction is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a Community area would, according to Tjaden, reported by 60% of 30%.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal the investor that it does not want to throw a knee between the legs, the observation that both sattel- which is based on the environment - and powder roof - which reduces the grape level and makes the construction of economic - would be possible.
Not only Wilfried Sohmer says that this addition is necessary.
If it helps: unanimity, it happens to the body.
The Community area is not so easy.
Daniela's reputation refers to the many own buildings with which we do not make such progress, we now reject the window in the common room, she says: 'I am difficult to do with it'.
Yvonne Staiger argues in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against local participation.
It sees a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because the purchase of the area, you will not give a subsidy, but will have a real value that can be marketable in the case of doubt, the counter.
Staiger ’ s request to split the proposal accordingly for a resolution.
Thus, with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarises: 'If we take the decision, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure'.

Hiking in the Harz from Stern to Stern
In the Harz, the first "StarPath" in Germany.
This is planned by the Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the need for information from many Harzbesucher, said..,,.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and star images.
In a first phase up to 2018, the association plans "well-achievable installations at five to six locations" in Oberharz.
Infrage cheese of St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile phone reception plays a part in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Path of Zug will be extended by train.
"On the Star Path, the viewers will learn a lot of information, for example about the physics of the individual stars", the association declared.
Moreover, they learned why stars would have different colors, or why one star brighter than another, even though it is much further away.
It also deals with what star image is a selected star and when it is best to see.
Since 2014, the association has operated the highest observatory of North Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often, you can see the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with the naked eye..
In the Uni-Stadt region there has been something similar to the planned start-up of the Planetarium Göttingen.
Beginning before Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path leads down to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (Municipality of Equality) with the planetary Sedna.
The steels with the individual planets - including the degraded pluto the dwarf planets - are located exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the exactly 75 meters away from the sun measures 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planetary route is about four kilometres.
While the light takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than light in the world.
But the march to the next fix star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing battle of less than £147 in the near future, met on Thursday.

"I am a former feather weight", reminded Garcia.
"I'm up for broners [to 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I am small for 140.
I would like to come down to lightweight.
And he must move on lightweight weights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That is what the fans demand.
Let us give them that. '
Lomachenko agreed.
'Boxes needs this fight. '
Climate asked whether it should be on Pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko will have to fight with a 135-pin debut this year to reconcile a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) of interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell for their lightweight campaign in the forum on 23 September.

Fortunas Hoffmann: 'Triple works better "
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2: 2: 2 for the season opening against Braunschweig that optimization of the defensive formation in Aue points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game, and the result would not have been the two opposing gates at 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two countertores too much, and we need to be more careful in Aue, says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge, the triangle is to be further optimized.
And a gateway after a release, the Fortunes don ’ t want to capture.
'For the future, it will be the case that no one is standing alongside Michael (Rensing). "
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the triangle than with the four-string.
"I don't know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure his thing, "because we have just in the triangle on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," said Hoffmann.
'Prerequisite is, but that we harmonise even better and we do not afford so many playwright mistakes. '
Of course Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about an unsuccessful start, don't know.
The performance could be quite okay, "Hoffmann said.
'However, if we can stand with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season start. '
His coach did not want to know that.
"I only judge the start to the season after six to eight days", says Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Sachsen in Heidenheim had to be aborted prematurely due to.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a bit more fresh, because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna.
"But they don't know as 100% where they are currently standing", says the interior defender of Fortuna.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting at the last (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away simply because we have the right to come under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is only a defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which must be beaten from the outset", explains Fortunas chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant".
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Review
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, undergoing a new method of medical assessment show that more than 80% of the people tested are over 18 years old, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (Count Coal Codder) has started carrying out the tests last year.
They are intended to clarify the age of age during the asylum procedure after the Swedish migration authority (migration trade) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, migration has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person 'may be under 18 years old'.
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months.
"We see no big difference in statistics of recent months, the numbers are quite constant," he said to the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied to his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person investigated was 18 years or older".
When Svenska Dagblag investigated the 581 results published, she found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of Weisheitis and MRT recordings of knees, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinsk Institute, whose work involves assessing people ’ s biological maturity to see whether they were sooner or later than usual by puberty.
"I had reason to think about this, and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say it safely, we should not pretend that we could, "he said to the newspaper Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is incorrect.
The greatest risk is if the person is less than 18, in this case, it is about 10%. "
Full Plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstrasse 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven tons of heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it runs super," says Reinhold Leicht, Head of the street and Transport Department in the Government Bureau of Freiburg.
In April, work began at the same time on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a barrel arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red bunch stone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly restructured.
The other two bridges lead through the Lauterbach.
They are built from red stone stone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.
On Wednesday morning, the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach received a 1.30 m wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a peripheral fortification which is also used as an operating route.
The southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday.
This is what the pedestrian path should be.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with patented bridges.
A special sense of sensitivity has required the insertion of wires through the Bauwerk in Lauterbach.
There is also a fibre optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project prior to the work by hand papers.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished first.
Traffic is regulated by an traffic light for bridges between the Bauhofhaus building and the Sammelweiher towards Schramberg.
For construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden".
The cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000 together.
It is funded by the country.

There is music and a lot of food, including a "prime-German potato alate, which the AfD could eat easily," says the woman who brought him.
The police ordered many officials to Gerolstein, and it shows presence above all at the station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD volcano ice that he has worked for such an event and received the surcharge.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun but got a cancellation there because there were not enough parking due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
So the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event".
Looking at the event at the Rondellvorplatz he says: "That is the right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful '.

There are about 200 listeners in the Chamber who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the Vice-Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
The police presence is undiminished, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than one hour, the guests on the ground have a longer breath, but there is also a short time after 9 pm.
The police can move away - no special incidents.

Russia ’ s athletic leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF conference on the eve of the athletic World Championships that his country ’ s secession was correct, and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were swept away at competitions gold and silver medals".
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF-President Coe said to the reporters.
'The entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is redesigned. '
Coe said he was also 'pleased' that Russia accepts the criteria for reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to restore Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the deceased system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletic athletics World Championships, starting in London on Friday, will compete as neutral players in accordance with the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF press, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Trauerakt for Soldiers crashed in Mali
At a ceremony in the North-South Fritzlar Fritzlar, around 1000 people of the two soldiers who died in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in Domstadt under high security precautions.
Defense Secretary Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two flying pilots as' experts.
"We reject this highest sacrifice that they have delivered on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from northern Hessen had died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mal.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total guard of the Bundeswehr to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At midday, only the members of the church took farewell.
After that, the wedding ceremony began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among these were Hessen ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of Volker Wieker Wieker.
Trauergaesthetics laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlar and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a canvas.
Secretary of Defense of the Leyen described the reversed soldiers as' highly decorated 'and operational experience.
The Stabshauptmann built the flight operation of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his Regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the Regiment to which the soldiers belong, said: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to do so '.
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Leyen: the stakes were dangerous.
But it is also of great importance 'for a country from which we are only separated by two states,' she said.
After the marriage ceremony, the coffins were taken from the Duomo.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide information.
Prince Henrik Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royal house shared on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is placed in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already completed a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen was in agreement with her husband's decision.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be abandoned in his country of France.
Prince Henrik had never made a witch from the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After the throne of his wife Margrethe throne in 1972 he would like to become king.
In 2016, he retired to retire in the title "Prince ahl".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby declared, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house.
Where the last retirement age of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, it is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his country of France, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked for over the past 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobleman, met Margrethe in London in 1965.
On the subject he worked in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand at the Danes in his barely 50 years of rule at the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed..,,.,..
These were just two mistakes! '
Prime Minister Because Snap Reelection
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony, Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has been elected to a rapid re-election of the country day, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday advocated the dissolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP from their country group in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country election, the Red Green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to opposition from the CDU and FDP opposition.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU", she explained on Friday in Hanover.
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his group be included.
The CDU and FDP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Green, 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new land day will be elected on January 14.
Thümler said that the red green government must now decide whether it could continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the land day decides its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday.
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the country ’ s day deprives the prime minister and elect a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be properly examined, "said Thümler.
'We will discuss all the questions when they are legally reasonable. '
Thümler called Twestens Step "somewhat curios".
The politician himself stressed: 'I am not a traitor.
I feel very good '.
She referred to as a follower of black green.
The Greens called on the dissenters to return their country mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return with immediate effect on her country's country mandate, which she has received through the Green Land List, with immediate effect", the presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The chairman of the Group of the Greens, Anja Piel said: 'We very much regret the decision by Elke Twesten'.
You have deliberately chosen not to hold a debate in the group.
'Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step '.
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of red green," the German Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s decision to re-elect the country ’ s day.
The exit Twelve costs red green in Lower Saxony.
The politician "in her injured vanity and frustrated her personal interests before the welfare of the country," SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is scandalous that the CDU is taking part in this dirty intriguing game and trying to capitalize on it.
Lower Saxony CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his members to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, warned Twesten esten, with personal careers, the outcome of the 2013 country election with personal care.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, and Greens had a very thin majority from one vote in the country.
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoners, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the German editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the egg charges.
Those affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if everything we know at the moment, a health threat is virtually excluded.
Does Aldi take the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of educator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my House has immediately opened its doors and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries of the countries.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are viable and safe for health.
If the maximum residue limit of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded, these are not viable.
However, uncontrolled eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, businesses are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
The current level of knowledge is not directly responsible for production companies.
Instead, they must face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the event of a disaster.
Is it only a matter of staff or the coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy cannot be 100% excluded.
It is precisely for that reason that it is clear that such events are carried out and the transfer to public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may exist.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the competent authorities to provide complete information.
Is regular alarm in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and safe food.
When an insecticidal is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The loose means that manufacturers, dealers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticidal Fipronil insecticidal in the position of food suppliers is unacceptable and must be brought to an end immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are quickly and fully informed.
How Football ’ s Financial Regulations affect Neymar ’ s Move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to Paris Saint Germain.
Some of the consequences will come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, because the leading organisation that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions-League Tournament.
Financial fair play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar ’ s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid €222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several $10 million a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar ’ s move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar sign and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team through the Qatar ruler family.
Clubs may spend a lot of money to acquire players, but they must counteract legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break even point in their soccer business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
Former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheated and risking ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million.
And, while Platini fell in disgrace by the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to advocate discourage excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the amount of EUR 44.4 million can be expelled at the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (then 82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions-League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by blowing their revenue through companies associated with clubs ’ owners.
While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeds standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be regarded as legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar about payments from the organizational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could easily be found.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars transfer, said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.,.,,.,.
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jerking sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state", said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports team, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"Once a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay, because different paths can be different or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country '.
Swiss is searching for a new Schoggle
In recent years, Chocolat Frey Bord Chocolat has produced Swiss.
Now, sweet cooperation is coming to an end: the airline is re-writing the order.
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small red chocolate boxes packaged 14 grams of packaged 14 grams will distribute the cabin crew before landing..,,,,,,..,.,.... and.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Nordwestschweiz" to 1.5 to 2 million Franks - Migros-Tochters achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: a shogger manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to betray how many candidates are in the new tender.
But only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey seeks to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate chips have been distributing Swiss on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate ablets in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo was launched two and a half years ago with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, first-class customers will be spoiled by the Confiserie Sprüngli, Business Class wet Passengers Schoggi von Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
The Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey is also available on the short distance from Chocolat Frey, both in.,.
Athletics - Discussion Olympic Champion Robert Harting achieves WM-Finale.
The three-time World Champion will fight for a medal in the final final.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, had failed in the national championship outbreak and could only look at the competition from the gallery.
The first attempt was made by the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, was also qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgie goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in "...,..
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of characters of the 80s, for the 90-year Grunge era (when the thinker David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for itself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to major things.
As a cultural artefact, it is also a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories.,,.,,, and.
But as a franchise, it feels as if time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By moving on to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children, who will grow up - they still made the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the poison principle, including a reff on the Stalker film of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that looks the cradle").
At one point, a character breaks through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the courses are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon ’ s sublippenbart of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old crack.
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show how she will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East West ring combat iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, suggests to be a television series of television: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism.
The main roles - a hardened Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gag gag (police spend time watching chess on television, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited to a smaller length, could better deliver its Agitprop science, since Gregor and Iosef regularly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who squad a pile of Hamburg.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for a voyage.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we are even doing it with our own recent history and with them.
Beating Drug Mafia in the Land
The police have managed a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar circle, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Public Prosecutor of Konstanz announced on Friday.
In doing so, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years of arrest and arrest warrants against them.
In addition, officials ensured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, as well as several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in Italy.
There were German arrest warrant against the two suspects of Italians.
The two are probably shipped to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the Public Prosecutor has been investigating Constance against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
That is why the large-scale deployment on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo.
In the eyes of the investigations, Italian nationals with close reference to the Italian mafia.
An incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early morning, is likely to go to the account of the bands.
Defects large gaps in the Foreign Register
'Data from citizens who should not appear there ': according to a report, the Foreign Register in Germany has serious shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions on asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the representative for the Federal Government of Refugees, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to major gaps in the country ’ s central register.
Deficits in the data recorded there could lead to some serious misdecisions in asylum procedures and deportation, warned that the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the data, ten million people with foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been adequately maintained, data quality has not been good in parts.
In individual cases, data of 1921 have been found, 'by people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register'.
"Bug data input can slow return processes significantly," says the report further.
In addition, the statistics on people who are expatriate EU citizens who do not have to travel at all.
However, such misalignments led to 'a distorted debate on the treatment of refugees', it says in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government seems to have begun to send refugee families back to Italy with children under 16-year-old children when they arrived.
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the New Osnabrücker Zeitung.
The paper says that the BAMF is conducting such procedures' for families with children - except for infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 '.
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually no longer possible, as the newspaper citing the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU State they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, this state can send it back to the entry country.
In order to explain why the office now says: 'In the meantime, the absorption capacity for families with infant children has increased substantially in Italy'.
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The domestic political spokesman of the left-wing group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children threaten to accept the inadequacies of the Italian asylum system and a threat to child '.... and.... and....
Second Best result
A total of 220 litres of blood of persons living in Oberreichenbach, the blood donation service already provided for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all, Jürgen Greule, who now divided 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, during the meeting of the Municipality praises the willingness to donate blood.
"It is genial how our body is designed for it and we pay respect the donors who provide their blood to strangers, even unselfish," said mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people", explained the circle leader of the German Red Cross (DRC), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conservatives are crushed into their constituents.
Three people could benefit from blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported of the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in spring.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK District Leader.
Obviously, the change to the theatre house had led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and received for 50 blood donations.
Half so many Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe coulds spent ten times a 500 milliliters of their life juice.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and slowdown in inflation have reduced speculation.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increased pressure.
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with less members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, warning that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just below 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that in the next few years, interest-rate hikes would be needed to rein in Brexit inflation, saying that borrowing costs may rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected that it will make GBP 15 billion more available under this system - with £115 billion.
minutes after the decision on interest rate, the Bank said: "In the MPC ’ s central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on households ’ real incomes continue to strain consumption."
At interest rates, they repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The down-adjusted growth forecasts of the Bank for this year and next year are compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31, and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision will not be changed after the recent disappointing growth figures have reduced rising expectations of an interest-rate hike, and GDP rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal salary increases, as the worsening becomes even worse before it becomes better.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" income collapse in the next few years, but it added that wages will be "clearly" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will compensate some of lower consumption spending.
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound ’ s fall.
The Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to fully achieve prices and the economy.
Before the Bank ’ s last verdict on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% last month to 2.6% in June, even though the Bank said that this was expected and will raise it again in the coming months.
The Bank said that exceeds its 2% target is "entirely" to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders loudly looking for shops and end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those in which existing deals expire and complete the new mortgages, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming ever more popular. '
NHS (The National Health Service) is supposed to prescribe controversial HIV-Droge 10,000 people.
Patients will receive access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight before the High Court against financing the drug in the NHS drug.
NHS England announced that preexposition prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86%, is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the process after last year ’ s Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite claiming that local authorities should finance it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England CEO Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that only enough medicines are available in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree with the study, including men, women, transgender, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered with a doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, including and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of humanity ’ s greatest health challenges. '
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted at needy and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September to September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement '.
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. "
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Minister for Health, said: 'The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue by government delays and slow implementation.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that this study should be carried out as soon as possible in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society '.
The Great Life Life: intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have transformed these small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold their bags.
"Before I lived in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with them and made an offer on this day '.
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a meat-level to make the most of the spacious ceiling.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, much light.
That was my request, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creative to solve the preset.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on each other without having to get us.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but also creating steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below. '
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.
A classic copper light window of Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored in order to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance you can find covered units for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By perceptions of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Combining kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little engineering art went there," explains Erfan of the steel market, furnied MDF door.
'It is counterweight, so it is very easy to slip the door. '
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the ground - or as your property is estimated," says Erfan.
'In a rudimentary form, a real estate broker will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the ground. '
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall into the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart '.
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metre from slightly standard.
Indeed, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers Fighting for $500 million of Real Estate Empires
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over $500 million worth of Victorias ’ s largest property empire.
The former director of the 'Carlton football club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be distributed.
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers possess 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.
The Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city centre, Brunswick and Sorrento apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburb.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of corporate assets and Paul.
A court act says that this means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The departments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought to be the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed mediations.
The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - as Colin, as Paul claimed, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul for managing some ownership incompetent.
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hope to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and legal firms held by both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family ’ s first jeans shop.
Colin says that he began Westco there when he was "the High School in my last years when Paul was a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," wrote them.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
Both Lukas and Mark, Paul says "have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin has remained very restrained, even though he was a former AFL Board member, and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded via SMS to say "I really cannot say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute," he said and added that he "still hope for a solution".
On Friday, this hope seemed over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media disdain.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do so.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in the hope of keeping the head on a more consistent course.
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House ’ s new Chief of Staff, met with senior staff on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that gets into the president ’ s hands.
Kelly said to staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he received good information. '
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate was angry to Trump for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of posts to convince him," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said to Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit was ever “under control ” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know to others - that without their intervention, Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more ignition.
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If his staff managed to keep trouble away from him several times, their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties, repeatedly try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about advisers' preference to provide the president with dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press sections, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is committed to finding out where they come from.
That was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocation Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh accused of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not offered concrete evidence, or that he has expressed false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to consult Walsh staff. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram that Trump receives."
How did this work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than primebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult.
Europol
As the address is unknown, the support of the population is requested and hoped.
Police across Europe this summer (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals flee this summer.
As the addresses of the wounded criminals are naturally not known, information from the population are hoped and requested.
Europol reported on Friday about the action following the 'EU Most Wanted' -Advent calendar.
Experience would have shown that many fleets of holiday destinations hidden, as Europol.
21 postcards for criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times it has been seen.
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them on the website.
Travellers negotiate a gulf and return to the 'Millionaires' series'
Some of the West Midlands ’ s wealthiest homeowners are back with some determined travellers who have negotiated a tomb from the community to reclaim a field in front of their houses.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "Millionaires series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unblocked to find a way.
Farming people have afflicted the Solihull Council, who said that it was' useless to deal with the problem '.
An anonymous resident said: "They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers-by.
The Council must indeed be forced to implement it because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travellers were there in May, moved forward and are now back.
More came last night, probably even more today. '
She added: 'The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot even stop this. '
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said: 'It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area. '
A speaker from Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls, and we.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many people as possible to report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the Court must examine when we submit our case '.
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
The closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, approximately 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenue by the Kurtax.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation to the Council of Landratsamt as a collection accommodation, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the municipal council.
But especially Freudenstadt Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interest in the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels, with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Birkenhof hotel at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it into a three-star hotel category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, building carved containers have been in front of the entrance for some time, and when you enter the house, you can see the extensive renovation work.
The floors were torn out, partly covered ceilings, old bathrooms were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are fitted.
Everything should later become "beautiful to the citizen" as Thomas Scherer says.
'We want to make a jewel. '
Swimming pool, spa and a meeting room are all equipped.
You don't want to position at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but at an elevated inner city level.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, wants to develop a wide range of facilities.
Both individual tourists, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable at the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so Scherer.
The city's views are equal to those of the hotel group.
'We are on the same line '.
When it comes to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define exactly.
Nearly less than one million euros, he expects.
The exterior facilities are also put on front, and this is already clearly visible.
A large terrace is created in a courtyard which will be open from the restaurant open.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US Special Advocates Grand Jury
In the Russian affair around US President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller, a so-called Grand Jury, after a report.
The body has started work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, using people familiar with it.
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
The CNN station reported that there are already first preliminary invitations to meet a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of having deliberately interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation focuses on several men who acted as Republican advisers in the election campaign.
Reportedly, Mueller also looked more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Adviser had put Trump personally into the center and investigating whether the president might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether charges should be charged.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called charges.
Most of them are activated when they are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always behind closed doors.
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to interrogation.
According to the CNN transmitter, invitations have already been issued, revolving around Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report was..,.,,..
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his opponent, Paul Manafort.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the establishment shows that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be put in place to decide on the charge.
Nevertheless, setting up the body is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia history is a complete invention," said Trump.
The issue gives democrats a chance to feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about.
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury.
He also usually works in secret, but he emphasized.
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Representative.
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president was not investigated.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed, the declaration was further down.
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump had fired Comey.
Because of this smoke, accusations against Trump had become accustomed to obstruct justice.
Comey said before a Senate committee committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional congressional congressional, such as the Watergate affair around the late president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday that the special agent could no longer be dismissed.
Antarctica: Gigantic Ice Mountain is driving in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been solved by the Schelfeis.
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus of more than one trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometres, is now heading north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted.
It is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
It is not a threat to people.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear after researchers'..,,,, and..,.,....
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice cubes in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Centre for Snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
Many researchers believe that this can be related to global warming.
The now broken coloss was part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It is therefore growing further into the sea and breaks regularly.
Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this skeleton was the balance of wax and breakdown a few years ago.
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete sk.
There is a lot in favour of the Larsen-C Schelfeis, because the front edge edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.
In addition, the iceberg is under tension and can collapse if a piece of key.
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea levels because they swim on the water and displaces ice as much as it produces after melting.
However, the loss of the skeleton leads the glaciers to the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only a little bit, writes the British research project to monitor Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest slab of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean.
There it regularly breaks.
"Although it is natural and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.
"This is the broadest withdrawal since the record," he also confirmed.
It is controversial among scientists whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will now grow or retire in the long term and perhaps coincide, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, and added: 'Our models say that it will be less stable'.
But that development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the iceberg in the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen.
This long paddle of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years and is therefore one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest.
CDU Will Haustarif
Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers ’ association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer recess, the district day had 41 new posts in administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the Mettmann district administration.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day.
The teachers at the circle are obviously very desirable.
Approximately 620 applications were recorded for the places to be presented this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At the moment there are still 50 vacancies at the Mettmann circle.
Doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG to take the initiative to counter the shortage of skilled workers.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers, but also to counteract the future shortage of applicants.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, demanding CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
The circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a genuine 'competition between public employers'.
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave sick or age from the service.
So it is high time to act, so that no more jobs remain vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, the leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion.
He recently caused a fatty surprise during the district day when he publicly questioned the staff allowance and stumbled the other parties.
People want to see all the possibilities to leave the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not reach a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with local cities - should seek a house tariff", so people.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay better for employees and officials than the public service tariff system.
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money only if you change to a higher level based on professional years.
But the circle ’ s tasks have increased in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up in order to provide employees with the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy Strengthening NGO Migrant Rescue
Italy has warned NGOs using bailouts for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue unless they comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Secretary of the Interior, Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turiner daily La Stampa.
Minniti ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rettet Association, because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in an opinion on the social media.
'We can only judge all the accusations that are being made at the moment after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation '.
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take hose boat migrants, who are delivered directly by traffickers and that smugglers can leave so that ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting was supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the act of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The occupation is suspected of overturning the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, monitoring rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons rather than for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have, above all, an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to keep the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta, and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary, but acceptable because they would not bring 'significant changes or obstacles' of their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that, in recent weeks, the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives, and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
Rising and Trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available.
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley was a good starting point for the tours.
The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelschapel above Deidesheim.
It was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there have been longer and again, for which long trials were rewarded.
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, viewpoint at the viewpoint, connected by "flowige" trials and moderate rise.
On the last two days, many meters of altitude have been met again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shopping huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathe in the open-air inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also taxed.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres in altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is equipping itself for e-sport sport.
Will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium in wind and weather?
The fact is that E-Sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high Gagen.
This was also recognised by the first Bundesliga, which is becoming increasingly involved in this area.
At the beginning of 2015, VfL Wolfsburg, later FC Schalke 04 and last VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sports Division in mid-July and took two professional players for FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB", says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is certain that there are still a number of clubs on this train ".
Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup is organising the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-student of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football must deal with the 14 to 30 years old, that young people will continue to go to the stadium," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be more present in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What is this about?
E-sport games such as League Of Legends, Dota 2, Counterstrike, or even the football simulations FIFA at competitive level.
As in normal sport, leagues have become established, leagues where the professionals compete against each other.
And in the 2022 Asian games, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly needed.
Ingo Froböse has also been addressing the question for a long time.
For Professor at the German Sports High School in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because he is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid response capability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fitte player is a good player."
But Froevil also sees problems: "doping becomes more and more a topic".
Controls could be difficult to carry out online games and the structures of classical sport were missing.
On the positive side, the scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are on the international road, that is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth.
In 2016, it implemented EUR 50 million in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship, and large tournaments.
In three years, sales will be 130 million.
That is little about EUR 2.4 billion of the football league.
However, e-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "the Deloitte consultants write.
There are many countries on the international stage.
Large markets are Asia and the US, where ex-car players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood players Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a great deal in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a teaching subject, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and France, the first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB Executive Board Röttgermann.
It is no longer enough to fall in nostalgia, and to hide old times is no longer enough.
It is a question of preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company in the modern market.
"We live in a digital world", says Dutt.

Michelle Carter condemns for the texts pushing Conrad Roy to suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their sentencing behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was convicted in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is untreated.
My son was my best friend. '
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appointment.
She had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Closed in red trousers and a creamy flower, Carter stood with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken responsibility, 'she said.
"She did not show any repentance".
But Carter's lawyer said that it is a 'terrible circumstance that she totally regret'.
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that their "age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions'.
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is "no day when I do not betray the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything, and I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain that we will carry with us for eternity, "says it.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "persecuted" by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or a aunt for his children.
"No more to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life.
"Stop up, spring from a building, cry yourself, I do not know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments of suicide, she wrote: "You must do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from any press.,.,..,..,.....
The case has shared legal opinion.
One of the few who defended Carters was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murder on her British counterpart in Italy before she was released two years ago.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: 'Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison'.
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-Lahm of FC Bayern
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was a captain at the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern mourns a big season for the Confed-Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, that Joshua Kimmich immediately, even if the extra garment was very small.
But, since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer was seen, he made his commitment to the arm.
"The trainer did not announce it", the Confed-Cup-winner after his first bet as Bayern-Kapitän.
Well, the entry could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach was able to interpret Kimmich.
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as the leader of youth players, debutants and especially from their holidays.
Sugar sugar is best distributed to those who want to eat much to eat.
So anyone who has been chosen to take the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility '.
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old fled as a mini-lawn over the field.
Right at the back, this is his position, the white bind on the arm did its rest.
And at all, Kimmich played in this startup formation as the one who can best take the ruder.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unsolicited force.
He had a look for the whole while many others were involved.
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness (scarcely); Renato Sanches with the help of commencing the Asian trip (also only limited); and Sebastian Rudy and Nikla ’ s Süle with no negative impact in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot.
That, after all, worked very well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of defense, both acted sovereign.
The name-occupied Napoli Sturm was often difficult, and also tried to win a few times in the.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was not 'as we hoped'.
But he also showed a decent performance during the debut.
Gaming, tempo change: "For this style I was also fetched".
How uninhabited this Bavarian world is still for new entrants, after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but rather six or seven..,,,.,.,....,
Kimmich passed a few tough statements in the back of his new players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is left here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game ".
After all, he must no longer teach the new ones.
Alaba motivates ÖFB Women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB Women
Austria ’ s most famous football football team has reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wanted the ÖFB ladies well.
The Bayern-Legionary is almost club member of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our ladys.
The tweet of the Austrian soccer of the year and Champions-League winner should be a special incentive.
Perhaps our ladies and gentlemen, the famous Bayern-Dusel may well need.
Businesses satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economics praise Wissings ’ s Tempo
It was often incomprehensible, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister for Economic Affairs of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This is apparent after more than a year when the new Minister of Economics Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V question of change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Unternehmen (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
Natus's largest U-turn is in infrastructure policy: The link between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s priorities.
This year, the ministry hopes for a planning procedure, until 2021, construction law will.
The Western circumvention of Trier is also a part of the country ’ s plans, which is the and needs of the Federal.
The goal is to start the route in December 2020, says Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce (IHK) Trier strives, as suggested by Wissing, an Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that has been declining for ten years.
Moreover, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, the IHK.
The craftsmen ’ s Chamber Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of EUR 1000 for the completed master exam and EUR 2500 if graduates are self-employed within ten years after the master training.
However, the country ’ s home tax list remains a long time.
In the planned road construction, facts quickly, but at the same time, the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to employ mobility at the state company, only 29 posts have been occupied.
The IHK calls for more orders to external offices.
CDU group vize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than EUR 20 million in 2017 and 2018 less in the maintenance of national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also sobering in the country so far.
In 2016, regional companies had evaluated net supply only with the note 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about increasing Internet connections and disappearances.
Ex Minister for Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is now out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe - where, after four months of inconsistencies, she already.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash reaction.
One day before Audi ’ s announcement, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that 'there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions', referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a call back.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon emissions rules.
But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of car manufacturers to install plants to neutralise exhaust gases from diesel vehicles are also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen ’ s mistakes, which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested but are reduced in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged and others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition, and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to bypass emissions legislation in Europe, and a question focused on the United States has been extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profits.
That message came on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to ensure that the Isar visitors also participate, there will be a floss through Munich, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a big floss between Flaucher and Reichenbach Bridge.
And this is not a usual exercise, with Isar tourists.
The building reference will be made to clarify.
On the end you see a big information transparent.
It shows a rubbish.
The launch of a public awareness campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is..." is intended to sharpen the understanding of Isar as a protected wild flow.
Last summer, the river Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a cautious and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo ’ s Knollennasen and the Laughter of Unease
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoons, the nolls of his characters.
Even with 85 the Argentine is still drawing and works on a film.
His message: laugh, 'because there is too much suffering in the world'.
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years he performed as an artist, among other things, as a draftsman for greeting cards, which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost," he said once.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he achieved the breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again the artists of cities were inspired.
Large, roundabout murdillo figures are melting in drawings with the shielding tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
With calendars, puzzles, books for large and small, T-shirts, loops and watches, their drunk figures continue to be spread worldwide.
For six years he has worked on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a Giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand pounds as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which was supposed to come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I do not know exactly what they will say, it is strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That is why he is more likely to rely on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced.,,.,.
Dangerous Lavender from Provence
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and insects communicable diseases, causing great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf caves, and in very dry weather there are many of them. '
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender löl not only attracts tourists, but also for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ohren with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. '
The solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing the evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mix of sound and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the thüringische Rhön celebrates its 1200-year existence.

The murder of a journalist highlights Mexico ’ s growing threat in Mexico
The Riodoce weekly workers meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in Sinaloa State by organised crime, corrupt officials, and constant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into office, who were the target of an attack in 2009 or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrality, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s salary or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous.
There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are in the process: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are following attacks and threats under federal protection, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter, their editor and inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt even though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their divided topics, trauma, their nightmare, paranoia.
Although a special office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists ’ murderers are rarely tried.
At Riodoce, they are still insisting on treating Sinaloa ’ s violence, even though they are more rumors.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra.
"It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
'As long as we do not know why, we distrust everyone...,.,..,.,.
On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve River".
The shooter went away in his car and damaged it near.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But there is virtually nothing but silence on Valdez.
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields, because rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It does not make sense that in Sinaloa, someone or more people are shot on the street every day, or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoles for drug kings, larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for one minute that there is a state of 'peace' if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the blame for not protecting his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, believing Gangmite members bought every copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kioske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the seizure of another newspaper that published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce and sold 50 U.S. dollars.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the problem of drugs," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish tough investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dared to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce, she received the prestigious Maria-Moors Cabot Prize for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the Committee's International Press Freedom Award for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You must take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.
I do not want to be asked: 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why did you not say what happened?'
Valdez, the Riodoce team missed Valdez, who was able to flood like a dock worker, the friend who was generous with impoverishment and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: was his love for routine his abduction?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do their work and remain alive.
"You don't like it if you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways," to get drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it is wrong, stay away from it.
The anger is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa, as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where Riodoce employees met for security training, no mobile phones were allowed to watch journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two policemen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were mandated by the government to protect Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle class of Culiacan.
Half in joke, some reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50% of policemen who the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since reporters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto controlled.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has seen three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé to government spending that focused on the hometown of the governor.
And there was a group that carried out kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Public Prosecutor.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened, so caution was needed when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of El Chapo Guzman escaped a military attack.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have seen Valdez's column as the best informed source of abduction.
"We had already known what happened," Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slender body-stature.
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken up. "
The Valdez office has been transformed into a storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because employees have become something they never had expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snaped a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the Public Prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" at walking paths and buildings.
On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Sinaloa Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them kill because they told the truth.
Since then, she has asked for it to be re-divided by the government because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organised crime, government officials involved in it and an equal society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were stuck in a ceiling with organised crime.
The media Guardian Group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth mouth," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Your body was found together with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta Kartell: 'Here I am because of my reports'.
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the front page with the heading 'What do you want from us?'
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as appears to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, admits that drug trafficking is frightening him.
"Mexico goes hell, and so I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to summarise.
A series of shootings with bandenrivals and security forces near the Mazatlan had left 19 dead dead.
The war continued escalated, as promised by a number of cartel armies in the region.
From the Bordstein edge they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirenen took place near - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept guards to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid, they did not show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the Riodoce employees followed his tracks.
'How can you remember to close, "said Bojorquez said," if on the same day when Javier was murdered, the practitioners asked me to send them to the streets for reporting '.
Dinosaurier used to evade his enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian mining worker were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well received that they could even find that his shoppy skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "restless past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described it as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur copies of the world".
The Fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the.
His incredibly well preserved state has astonished researchers who describe it as' really remarkable ','.
According to reports in National Geographic, the carnivorese is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North of Alberta, Canada.
He met with something that seemed missing from the surrounding rocks and decided to look more closely.
The fossils he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years on revealing the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible.
'It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs'.
Researchers have found that, even though it is covered with armor and similar to a changing tank, it was probably threatened by meat dinosaurs.
The strongly armored dinosaur used a red and white camel to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as counterburial coat used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed to mix better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal, and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exploring it carefully.
The amazing conservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered contention, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although contention is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds those of today living.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals using countershading - think of Rehe, Zebras, or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real battle for survival.
"Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous dinosaur predators must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal of evidence of his life, including his conserved intestines, to find out what it eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, went into a river and was driven into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to be much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scalp, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost as in the early chalk period.
You don't need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it; if you shoot a little with your eyes, you might almost believe it is on sleep. '
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was driven by some of his terrible ancestors.
The Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology magazine, believe that Borealopelta was sinking in the sea after death and mumified in the mum.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray, north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from sneak to the hip.
Creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch peaks that stood by his shoulders.
Researchers believe that Western Canada ’ s carnivorer was blown up until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.
The preserved remains of this special specimens are so well preserved that the skin remains hollow panzer plates along the dinosaur plates along the din.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a profit in the lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it.
Versteinerte remains of the skin still cover the holy panzers that carry the skull of the animal.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are stretched up.
I can count the scales on his sole sole '.
In the Storm: Mass Carambolage to A8: Many injured
An accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injuries, kilometres of congestion and casualties.
Some 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon on the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8).

The exact number of injuries were not provided for the exact number of injuries.
It was easy to medium serious injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large set of rescue vehicles was at the accident centre.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, there was a distance of about ten kilometres long.
As an AZ reporter reports, there was also massive obstacles on the counter-carriage - through numerous casualties.
The fire brigade noted the signs of the vehicle drivers, who now have to face severe penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.

Deutsche Bahn: Group tests' Comfort Check-in ''
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.
Or one is deeper into his work and has just a brilliant idea.
And then: pufff.
When the creator comes and awakens an impatient or rides the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the periods of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the crewless ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and devalues the ticket.
Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.
"If the offer, we will extend it.
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany, "said a railway precher.
"Comfort check-in" calls the train card devaluation without creator.
In order to be able to use these, however, some conditions need to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
You also need to buy it via the train that DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book your ticket.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like: you get up in the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
For the test customers a button for electronic devaluation appears.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y seat.
When the train attendant at the ticket check in square Y he knows that a passenger with already depreciated online ticket.
So you can rest on sleep, continue working, continue to remain silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for rail - which in turn should use passengers.
"If you want to travel by our train staff without ticket control, simply check in the DB Navigator.
This enables passengers to personalize their travel time in the train, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Secondly, "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs'.
Those who often drive the train will know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are one of the biggest problems.
It is often the case that one of the participants do not have all the documents needed to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document must be presented.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, resulting in bad mood in the distance or large area and delays in controlling their own ticket and ultimately takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet available.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled through a post from someone from the High School.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street", said it was there.
Realized because nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah has been constantly retrained on their timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis area was killed in the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted an image of Brown ’ s lifeless body that was stretched on the street and would stay four hours.
"That is wild", Ferrell thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She removed her cell phone to return to Tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and by a man who claimed to be Brown's father who called a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bell-dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman secured his gun and shouted: 'I will kill you... animals all.'
"This is not customary", Ferrell remembered her statement.
'This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical '.
At this moment I felt shocked.
I was angry and crying '.
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from 11.
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people living in the Community and filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell with her daughter, who had a flower dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two talked about a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about black experience and black state «.
"You remember how I taught you, when black people must fight for what they believe in?" she reminded you of what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I could not take them, "said Ferrell later.
"What has happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past..
She must know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only know activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Although I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience glaring racism, she is no different from the next black women.
I feel I would do her a disservice to keep her away from it. '
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campsite when the activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson.
Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. '
Weekly later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what happened.
A question came into mind: 'Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?'
This skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people, often by white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview, 'We had heard that people born and grew up in Ferguson did not centralise their voices and we wanted to do it differently.'
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death tract.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of Whose Streets? "in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us.
'That was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, because I will be presented '.
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell ’ s experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messias leader but a community coming together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she loves and marry her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
'But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and the humanisation of black people. '
Moreover, Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin ’ s black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. '
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action", where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who shattered this energy", she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is at stake.
You can feel your energy through the screen. '
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on currency for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
However, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains'.
From "Dream" to "Size": TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery ".
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it is far from built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone divides since the first presentation in 2009, the population in supporters and opponents.
Kalt leaves the subject.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the Bit Gallery say: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Do not need man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Size!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, as well as the rest of business, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bloom.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the property where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years.
Most of our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women.
We have also discovered the butcher for us.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
There are other cities.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers in a market hall in the gallery, comes at the level of the rent.
This is unlikely to be low in the new project. '
Eva Kilic: "Wozu Shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough of this in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive.
As you can see, shop shops are only rented by larger companies, because the rents are often not acceptable to a retailer.
It is a pity, special shops are almost no longer available and what remains of it will probably disappear. '
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farmers' market hall during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term if the bit gallery actually comes.
Or does the ghost Bit Gallery before releasing all shops from Bitburg? '
George Marquet: "This will simply not work.
And there is no need for a shopping centre that is empty.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a proper farm market rather than this gallery.
But for a farm-market hall, thanks to the insane many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers' market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear. '
A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost unimaginable - attached to cable on the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from chelsea Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the sections from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publicly publicly disclosed diplomatic information about WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming Resemblance (A Successful similarity).
It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transwoman and landmark dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg has developed through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits, what someone could look with these genomic data, but also an intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward, but has openly spoken about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six breaches of the espionage law, computer fraud, and theft.
The prison was suppressed by her image, so much that there was only one photo - a grain, black and white selfie, in which manning appears insecure on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012-project Stranger Visions.
In that, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette stumbles and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal correspondents who exchange several letters over two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.
Indeed, just a few days after the book was published, Obama would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something low and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informers from the government camp and transgender troops to find new, tweet-capable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a particular reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name has a heart), an end to the "automatic fragmentation based on sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and G and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the advanced scientific dictionary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope will take with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
'DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories. "
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the aforementioned comic novella.
She shows manning how she emerges with a hands-on phone in her hand from the disciplines of the United States like King-Kong.
"When they cold your speech, they have won," it says.
"So never stop the mouth".
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
'I still get goose when I talk about it. '
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, by its own genomic simulacs, which gather together like hordes of Protestants.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplogy groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
'I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation '.
Professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford for killing killing.
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are looking for suspects after a man had been raised in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with lethal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) Arrest Warren (56) Arrest Warren (56) Arrest Warren (56) were issued for murder of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranleau as.
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau, 26, died after several cutbacks.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Agency states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead in the place of the event, and detectives investigate the cutbacks as murder, while the police actively searches for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been vacant and excluded from entering Northwestern University Campus.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A university spokesman and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that 'we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way.'
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he strongly urge suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional, and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building age of the Grand-Plaza building, which had just received a mysterious tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Mutko Mutko
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this respect, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for reinstalling RUSADA and recently published on the organization ’ s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could give cause for concern to Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
With regard to the matter Mutko said: 'We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist '.
Mutko ’ s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules.
Nobody pretends to accept this report unconditionally ', Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from implementing doping controls in Russia in November 2015.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After visiting the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" in order to be reinstated.,,,,,.
Aldi is no longer selling eggs eggs
That shared the business groups.
It was a mere precaution that no health impairment could continue to be considered in the communication.
From now on, only eggs will be delivered to Aldi, who have been demonstrably negatively tested on fipronilate anti-Laev.
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber Uber....
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck at your e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
Replies were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She asked people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment, it enables companies to carry out surveys, to address specific groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaints hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite executives and directly to the Board of Directors.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card from the company that shows at a glance which units most complaints have and which executives have low approval results - so you can borrow why.
Companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation, and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
As Glint, Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can report bad behavior.
And when the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, Convercent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures, and have a simple way to reach their headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often intimidation and inconvenient experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
'And we protect our shareholders against employment disputes'.
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee commitment in 2002 more seriously after the Enron scandal, Arthur Andersen ’ s accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from being online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds Venture Capital investors who supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising all capital to $47 million.
Glitzers secured $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and brought all its funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing research complex that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that belongs their voices, and that the work you are doing is worth, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well when their portfolio companies are running well when employees are engaged and committed.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
Data on employee commitment according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
Indeed, when a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change is not fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivize employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you do not follow employees will ask themselves," Have you really heard me?
Are you concerned about this?
And who do not care about why should I? '
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, so salvation.
And, after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company receives new insights about employees, and it hopes that, in the long term, this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
There is a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the team's new training fields on the campus.
Some have removed their jerseys and show their back full sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players entering the summer courses will return to their final exams before returning to the Water Man Football Center at 6: 30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real tretmill for the next three days," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday to Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
This is why the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 7.15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players. and,,.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season, and during the summer school for the first time during Moras during the summer school in Westwood.
They are expected to hold 18 exercises during August 20, before the start of formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he support the NCAA change regime, even if they add another point to the multi-faceted routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they simply pushed it through, they are great people.
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great. '
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task, given the clear lines of its fields, from a adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a top-class hotel already covered with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a gate.
Bruin players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people hire a room there and then set up to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We will do the best to do with what we have..,.,..,..,.,.
I am not worried, therefore.
We have a plan. '
Facebook wants to intensify face-checking in the fight against fake news news.
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reviews from third parties and show their results under the original post, said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday, and., and.,, and, and..
In an opinion on its website, the company said that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible falsehoods and send them to factual auditors who may show results of the fakt test from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distributional points for so-called fake news, many of which believe have influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hasty postings as they did before the September elections..,.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to recognizing the stories of third-party factual auditors, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its recent past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has seen 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says hurry.
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand '.
'A Castle in England' covers the period from the Middle Ages to Edward's age and documents the families living in Scotney.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally.
"I only responded to the thumbnails on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's years working for the Jakobiner", he says.
"That is his thumb pressure!
And letters always smell after smoke, because at that time one fire was lit because of light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he was there.
Oh, I love archives! '
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting") all this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watch the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted Hyänenköpfe on the walls and the bottles that spent centuries in the grave.
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape patrons, gardeners and sometimes with artists working on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he trank "whiskey and began writing".
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees began to look after the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, put it on the roof. "
Tagebücher, letters from the time of English Empires, maps which represent who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch for the two families fought.
Young, let everything go! '
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer's uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a revolt that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"The farm uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising is a good start.
Perhaps the two are connected? '
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron, which the Darrell family hidden for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which Arthur Darrell is depicted from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes ’ favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be a cronies, make debts and spend money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boy, with a talent to promote inheritance. '
After the end of his operation, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experience.
He passed a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a early 20th century sanatorium, which has been recalled by nature.
However, Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like: 'Oh, now I have to deal with the damned life'.
Campaign: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf
The town of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new roof mark (Thursday) on Friday.
Until Thursday Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too good for us.
Or? ", the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We do not think that (of course!) do not really think," they write on their website yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that, as a Bad Honnefer, we know citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our city. '
The action is about more than 'just' one logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is important to make a pledge, one that gives the city a distinctive unique unique feature.
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military Reform in Turkey – Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army
Every year in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and promotions in the Official Corps.
This week, too.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with Turkey ’ s armed forces one year after the coup attempt.
The sitting was no longer in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The five vice-presidents, as well as the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers.
As a result, the YAS civilians were overwhelming.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
General Secretary Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the army ’ s commanders, the army, and the navy were abandoned.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired off 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army ’ s ranks – mostly because of alleged connections to the exile prediger Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a draftsman of the coup attempt.
There have been negotiations in Ankara since this week against 486 people who are directly involved in the coup attempt.
As early as the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the 'sins gift', as he gave him the opportunity to "clean up" the armed forces ".
But does Erdogan really manage the army?
At the end of February the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unease in the Military Headquarters".
In general, there are concerns about increasing 'Islamisation' of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers.
In any case, the large-scale cleansing of the army and the security forces goes on.
In mid-July, Erdogan fired another 7395 officials, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were earlier than the country ’ s true masters.
On three occasions, they brushed on their role as guardian of the secular state order.
Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step, not least in the light of the European Union ’ s reforms.
Former officers say that Erdogan is pursuing Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a non-named officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that happens, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts about the Turkish army's willingness to act.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," Nato diplomats.
Washington Changes the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules, President Donald Trump, cited by the media.
It provides for a reduction in legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
'This law will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save billions of dollars on taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are spent green cards. '
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to repair track track for racing huts.
Time and again over the past few months on the future of the race track has been contested.
Before the end of the year, the marod route on which the tourist track will be built.
In order to secure the future of the race lift hut, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work will begin this year.
"With the decision to continue to order and repair the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection especially important for tourism", declared Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was around EUR 2.5 million.
The country accepts 75% of this sum.
The Treaty on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is now being voted definitively.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"This is the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards", said Sühl.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for eleven years.
This will allow the racing shuttle to be regularly ordered on December 2017.
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a popular rail connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations.
Over the past few months, a pilot operation has been tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order them in the future.
The track is also heavily burdened in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about.
Just when you thought that it could not become more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex-robots are now a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University, and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest warts and the type of fingernails.
"People are funny about them, but companies provide a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey said when he published his new report.
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his convictions, selecting everything from the eye color of the robot, the shape of the chest warts to type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more worrying because many robots have the "personalities" who would make a stepfor-woman look progressively.
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find more appealing, such as shocking.
And then there is the Roxxxxxy Gold Sex-robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of intimacy and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality," blows the website of True Companion.
So she likes whatever you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
During the day she also has her mood - just like real people!
It can be tired, fixed on conversation or it can be "in mood"! "
There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape when one step on Frigid (i.e. defiant) Farrah, cause one concern most.
On his website True Companion Roxxxxy compared with a Vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have a roxxxy?" says it on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional addition.
Most men will, of course, not hold sex robots, and while FRR notes its rising popularity, they remain provisionally on the margins of consumer culture.
But what leaks out of the periphery can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission.
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots are appearing at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has ironed women sexually assaulted.
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphic images, the winding bodies and the eyes of the eye, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn proportions).
Their builders want to feel human beings, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, when it comes to their "personalities", robots are not real women.
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply go away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjection.
In other words, they are good slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 Speech: Female
Trump ’ s great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense of common sense.,.
It has become a truthfulness of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have divided into small size families.
Around Christmas and Erntedankfest, there were newspapers in the US about how to deal with Trump ’ s horror.
We are all supposed to get our filter bubbles.
Less notice has been the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousine, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, anyone who knows it, including the Republican kinship with whom she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but his presidency ’ s apparent effect has the power to put us all right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gruesome possibility that his armies will no longer destroy us.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes ” Republicans who suddenly appear as an epitome of sensible relative to its standards.
Today, I find myself struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urcomic version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, which 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - both of which, in fact, appear to be very mild offence compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the Republican candidate must only be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousine was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel at Central Park, the largest of New York Park Carousel, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crazy and the animals twist to look at their own shoulders - extremely finest and climate-friendly music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not justice to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not entirely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in northern London.
The Central Park Carousel, however, is still a strange magical experience, as two two-year old, an 11-year-old and two women can go to it in the 40 ’ s years and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full number of points, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the carpet.
This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but it also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed.
The poor woman in the department was apologetic to grinsend, while I was tired of getting my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with breast aches.
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was brought to hospital for treatment of cuts in his hands, according to the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder after an appeal by the.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of the Valentinstags in 2013 by shouting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightmare who hid in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Office said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his penalty will be increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As a Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg.
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the four plaintiffs from Fützen and Epfenhofen were laid off during holidays and in secondary schools.
Three of the disengagement students will go to the gymnasium, four at the Realschule.
The school leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at Biesental in Epfenhofen.
The 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grew up in the chickenerhof, but then released into freedom.
In addition, the muntere Schar introduced a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, leaving it out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken breed, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning him into a chicken broke down, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain mountain.
After that, the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank showed a chicken.
The hens danced with the young gockles who played cylinders to the bet.
The adler stands for integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
The boy is different from the other young animals (chicks), but is part of it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His provision is to be free.
She wished every four plaintiff that he felt accepted in his new school.
It was followed by thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school manager Michael Müller, who always jumps in school bottlenecks, and the parents' representatives.
The cake time is over, explained class-teacher Sophia Schumacher.
They leave their students very reluctantly after two years of teaching because it was a really great time.
In the end, they have been able to rely on the four-knife barrels.
In conclusion, all students decided to find a song of summer time and holiday time.
The children had great pleasure in doing so.
Eight first plainters are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted on television.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of illegal tentative people, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camp and put substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose fines.
Software Update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now?
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the Euro 5 and in part Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives an assessment:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have fired software", says Anja Smetanin.
Its retrofit has ordered the KBA.
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months, but not yet specified a precise date.
Daimler has informed us to sign any person concerned.
If an inspection is due in any case, it will be done within their framework.
How long should the conversion be carried out?
"Smetanin says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and political pressure.
'Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment. '
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more time to get an appointment.
What do drivers do not drive cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow, Smetanin.
Is a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
ACE fears that.
But precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there is no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J received Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
President Trump ’ s first prize ceremony promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper one of the most sought awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday, the singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be issued at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a welcome and join his wife Melania.
Lear, known with progressive TV series, announced that he would not be participating in the gala.
The 'New York Times' he said: 'This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of resources - and that is a burden on me'.
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the City Life worth
Roland Wacker, Haslach ’ s city builder will retire next year.
The job is already posted - suitable applicants are rare.
For 31 years Wacker has been a city builder.
And his work still makes him great fun as he conveys in the press interview.
He reports on varied but also challenging tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application fulfils the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible time.
That is how, while respecting the regular termination periods, it should be enough time to deal with it.
Since Haslach acts as a subcontracting authority for the administrative community, the applicant must submit relevant accounts.
Because this function wants to keep the city.
If they were no longer able to fill them, citizens would have to go to Offenburg.
But proximity to the people is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated on Wacker.
"We make the city life worth", he is secure through the building office and its staff.
In the future, however, varied projects are on the agenda: the reorganisation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz square are started.
The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium renovation is still subject.
The latter alone will beat around EUR 1.5 million, 'if we get it right', Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. '
There is a lot of room for a city builder.
With Haslach ’ s own building and gardening, it is possible to react flexibly to many things.
"You can move a lot", says Wacker, and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is an ensemble under protection of monuments, it is important to have an eye for what is purified "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing town builder.
In any case, the mayor bears a heavy responsibility.
He is a builder, 'at the end everything goes over my table'.
He can count on many years of staff and coordination: Markus Neumaier (building) has been present for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Also that his successor remains a long time, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place '.
Because continuity is important not only for a good business climate, but also for the further development of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to perform a completed study as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning law.
The City Building Office is subject to construction and underground construction, building management planning, basic employment matters, management of urban properties, city office with Bauhof and Stadtgärtnerei as well as underground construction law, including monument protection.
Cycling on lines: South Railways closed.
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway track in the area of Leobener Street (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators depart from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night.
Nearby witnesses a rosaroter roller and a bicycle rider were observed.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich", said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch to APA.
The perpetrators would have put themselves at great risk and endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage caused by the locomotives, the delay and the cost of rail replacement transport, the paedophiles of railway customers could also be assigned to the perpetrators.
The speaker said.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon and rail transport on the southern railway route could be carried without any obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains had been dropped on Friday morning, two of them related to long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fall, but they had delay.
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts have also been damaged.
Red meat, milk products, and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory disease).
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory disorders.
The incurable state that affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach and vesicles, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The chief researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immuncells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues.
If the balance tends to inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory disorder.
Experiments found that a kind of tolerance immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intake.
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the Darm microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan had had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells ".
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a more tolerant diet, less inflammatory intestinal intestinal, if the same system worked in humans.
The postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immunization that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestine robioms of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach tract.
The dams of the mice were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria found in mice with the immune cells, but without the mice.
mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a intestine robiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.
To understand how bacteria had an impact on the immune system, researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a fluid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without bacteria - to unmature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed to tolerate cells.
When the active component was cleaned, it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan-metabolism known as Indol-3 milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50%, but when the Tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach tracts.
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to Tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
potent tryptophane values in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic ".
At Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria.
The £40 million signature of Chelsea began with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the Holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
Matic had been excluded from the Blues Preparatory Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season.
"He takes time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later '.
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to meet three of his four priority commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the association", he added.

The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US State of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner.
The whole was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky.
New Upgrading for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem with a problem
As the wind turns: when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader, Social Democratic Prime Minister always looked after Berlin with some concern.
Not a disturbing fire from the party ’ s central party, just no headwinds – the most important desire of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, that has changed radically.
Since then, the Willy-Brandt House employees have been watching the events in the SPD-governed capitals.
What Schulz received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described with headwinds.
They were deep.
One after another.
After the surprising end of the red green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red green can simply not govern reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the country election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP opposition.
The founder of the German Federal Chancellor Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway low-Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
Transgression to the CDU means a clear mistrust of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must return their mandate immediately, "said the Federal Managing Director and Electoral Campaign Director of the Greens to the editorial Network Germany (RND).
"That must not be true," a SPD campaigner when the new hio message reaches the party centre on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands to the CDU without a majority of his own government.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD counties.
And nobody knows what happens next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly marked defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, did the comrades at the time.
After the country elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That became the case - and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln, and the Dusseldorf bankruptcy.
The comrades were quick to get back in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him the next downfall.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus this weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because he then made quite quite wrong in crisis communication afterwards.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust gases and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has long been in criticism.
Miese surveys were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because, in recent weeks, it has tried to set the accent in the covenant.
The former mayor of Hanover ’ s desire to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because the partisan strife of the Lower Saxony Greens does not actually blame.
And Schulz certainly not.
For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all, to the dismal parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and democratic, as Mrs Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of everyone else", says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Bundestag, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the national list of the Lower Saxon Green.
The logical consequence would be to give back its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag, laments an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The willingness to vote four years ago was clear: people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as the top candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now, the personal careers of a future CDU MEP distorts the election result," said Oppermann said.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know whether more has been there or there has been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Aid for Ortskern III
Anyone who wants to renovate his house in the years will soon be able to receive support from the country.
On Wednesday, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG City Development on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a look at what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas in the.
At that time, in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was 60%.
For Schindler, the remedies to date are a "success project" - it is important to promote internal development too, and not just to open up new areas..,,,.
On 4 April, the government Bureau of Karlsruhe received information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding was EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would be from the country, and the rest of the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a remediation area?
You will continue to investigate where the "really old" houses are.
But it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial borders could then be postponed again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder program "Soziale Stadt", which would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of urban cities, improving housing and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per plot.
The recovery area would then be defined as a statute.
The eligibility period for funding is under way until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the inventory would be carried out in which those involved in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire for filling out.
In November or December, the decision on the Statute should be made, as possible, so that the remedies can be started next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing urban maladministration and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
It will also be registered for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come back to Empfingen and make an image of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and plot sheet", which includes, among other things, the construction condition and renovation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing sheet", information can be provided on the size, distribution and residents of a living room.
The blue "operating sheet" can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building.
However, Gotzel pointed out, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for.,,,,.
Moreover, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of funds works according to the "greyhound principle" - who comes first, exhorts first.
You can't reserve any funds for later days.
In the end, photos of the project "Ortskern II" project were shown to make the guests greeneration "tasty". "".,..,.,.... and
British inventor himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car.
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and pointer and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by BioTeq company.
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advising anaesthesist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam ’ s company also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House ’ s Advertising Cost Thousands Thousands of Tax
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the military left to TIME magazine.
The green white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour through products from all 50 countries.
The Connecticut helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin firefighter and a Mississippi forklift truck.
The White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn, following the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility", the commander of HMX-1 wrote to his supervisor, on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the Deputy Navy commander for aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 a.m. on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and remained until the lawn was cleared this evening between 18: 00 and 21: 00 p.m..
The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second team would be required to return flight due to the restriction of hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time.
The records made available by TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
rows indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the rule.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Klingt as if you are closed", the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he advocated efforts to curb government rules.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But only to request their use for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential plane was carrying out taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential.
"The White House is thrilled by the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials", said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX 1 crews often perform training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to assess the US president at the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was in the training needs of the crew for the month, said a civil servant.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden for none of the other requirements presented at the event.
A Speaker of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have budget designations for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to the hourly rates of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year, however, the DoD refund rate for the VH 3D is $24,380 per hour.
The unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter operating costs are far below that rate.
"Setting the cost of taxpayers based on estimates of reimbursement rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
'These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds'.
According to a 2015 RAND study, the doD ’ s reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but consider the cost of fuel, maintenance, and contract conclusion.
At that time, former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter ’ s use for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week produced in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this. '
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his round of South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver ’ s seat of a fire-fighter car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked the media about his own fleet of company products.
'I know Sikorsky very well, 'said the President,' I have three of them '.
TC BW Neuss
Leaders of the second tennis league will join the table third search dorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start in Kiel at 11 pm in Kiel at the table.
Despite five scores still impeccable record, the leader of the second tennis league has gained the sense of reality.

How America Can Damage OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he put his signature on the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday.
"In his hatred to enact the law", Congress had packed some "unconstitutional rules" he estimated.
The response from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US initiative.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors from OMV ’ s domestic OMV, who, together with other European companies, have co-financed the construction of the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea coast.
The threat is enormous.
Nevertheless, it is too early to assess the consequences, as the oil company ’ s official statement.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would need to raise sanctions by an Executive Order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"The press" has looked at which the Group could resist and which could really hurt.
Narcos Staffel 3 trailers: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be placed in the hit series of Netflix.
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobars Killer, Netflix is far from over.
The Staffles three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest socks of the show.
With the third season, DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali-Cartel.
Led by four powerful sponsors, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commanded the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, who invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Role backward: The city introduces 46 kitchen aids.
The city organizes the Kita-lunchtime again.
With strong contact partners for children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city centre.
As of September 1, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban childcare facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Director of Youth Aid, this is good news: 'We have all been very pleased'.
Cooked is still outside the house: a caterer takes this task and supplies freshly cooked cooked.
The city operates 46 childcare centres in the Krefeld area, where children receive a warm meal at lunch time.
In the past Kitajahr 2800 children were sitting on the tables, and demand is growing steadily.
"Not only children who are cared for 45 hours in the Kita at lunch", explains Pommeranz.
'The offer also applies in the 35-hour support if children stay until 14 o'clock '.
46 part-time staff have kitchen service from 1 September: They warm up the food delivered, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, individually portionate the meal, remove, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita", says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven-group facilities - determines the amount of hours.
"The kitchen workers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts".
It is also about this: healthy diet and cooking lessons.
"Children should help prepare the food".
The staff were very helpful and friendly.
For children too.
"They have a known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people '.
This continuity is important for children.
The cleansing of the kita rooms - so far the job of kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in terms of cost comparisons between own registry and foreign allocation for the city, and.
And that, even though 46 part-time forces are re-recruited.
"But these hours do not fall so heavily in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will stand in provinces in the provinces. Three women stand for the role of Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be handed over peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan ’ s democratic success.
The Afghan independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with their friends.

The investigations are underway.
GMB concern about investments in the McVity factory in Glasgow.
A trade union would like to reassure the managers of Biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company kept quiet about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVity ’ s owner, Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be "learned" first "if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie's call to express concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines'.
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Affairs Manager will not be able to gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the workers are concentrating heavily on the local community and Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a prosperous production presence at McVitie. "
One spokesperson in Pladis said: "The Filialleiter at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly, because we appreciate the constant commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate, we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than GBP 5 million in our tolerance cross-site location, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility, and if our operating processes change at the site, employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this.
Did the PSG Barcelona warned about Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not diminish in its pursuit of Neymar after giving a £189 million to withdraw its exemption clause, but did they warned Barcelona three years ago before the World Record?
The sensational approach fueled the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned for £89 million to Manchester United last season.
After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out outside, even though a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to care for him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the PSG president warned about this prospect three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club to sign one of the best players from PSG.
"I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, it will have consequences. '
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer's interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to depart under any circumstances, and Barcelona felt the consequences of this interest by losing one of her price offers for Neymar.

Interview: "Domspatzen report discharge the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to further discuss.
Christian Weisnder, Speaker of the Reform Movement "We are Church", explained after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritized Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful for the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their misappraisal of what happened at that time.
On the other hand, the Vatican Office criticized the fact that 'double standards' in reporting on violence in domain domains.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is' shameful and shameful actions', which would have to be punished and prevented in the future, but striking the 'degree of media manipulation', the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "You would like to go to the church and this is a dedicated fresco".
She also pointed out that in her youth, 'beatings had been a quite normal pedagogical means' to cope with freak children, as I was one.
They would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of abuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the book "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I must protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him", he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber by Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
In total 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were sexually abused by attacks, 67 domspatzen were sexually abused by attacks.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary it can be noted that Domkapellmeister R. have used forms of physical and mental violence in many cases.
Particularly with high emotionality, the punishment could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many others accused, many victims estimate the general humanity of R. R.
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger.
Mr Hesemann, the 440 page report on the "incidents of violence against defendants at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, it also appears to be a choleric and perfectionist, who has often become handful when a dome track did not produce top performance.
How do you consider this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger comes in this.
He has just been devoted to eight pages, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or cooperation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the pre-school school also took place outside its sphere of scope.
At best, one can accuse him of having learned it too late, or having not taken the first suggestion seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he acted was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heavens" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as a very good teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and bones, and was always surrounded by children.
Only a minority complained about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to rage.
He himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for that.
In his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s.
Do you know these methods?
Of course, I think all of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
However, compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence of violence on the pre-school school.
One wonders whether it is not related to his popularity and role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media.,,,.
Many people who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian pope.., and.,..,..,...
The truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
A great deal has been reported in the media on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger be charged any involvement or complicity in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Cathedral captain.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said a deputy for the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me".
The real problem of informing sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent.
If they did not even entrust to parents and siblings, it is certainly not a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger ’ s role with regard to abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A questioned student formulated it so: "Regarding sexual abuse... see no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it... too is really absurd to assume that it is precisely him... Buben more penetrating or clearer or even more, than with their parents, boarding guides, trust teachers, etc.
That he talks about sex... - unthinkable '.
Thus, the report concludes that the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance, could not be confirmed.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be exempt from any co-visor.
He cannot be accused of not having prevented or brought him to the display.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these abominable crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, a lot of "violence zessen" at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report.
Does he have to live with this charge?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything has been mixed and poured into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger.
That is, however, an abuse of the report.
In fact, there is a clean separation between the pre-school and the gymnasium of domains, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the domain.
The whole terrible caning pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were quite harassed and maltreated and suffered horrific conditions, all occurred on the pre-school school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
However, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most of the witnesses emphasize, was the topic "preschool".
One was happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisic" conditions.
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims estimated the general humanity of R. R. and, therefore, in many cases, even though violence, combine positive memories with him '.
At most, the accusation of having looked away away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods in which it was reported on pre-school conditions.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger keep his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this, he points out that 'caning will continue to practice caning'.
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when caning penalties were already banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as everyone of us knows.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the people concerned might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the limit was really exceeded.
However, one cannot say that he has always looked away away.
That is simply not true.
Only in 1980, caning was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to the time.
How do you see this?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trap of anachronism", in other words the danger of judging past moral standards.
The prince is right here.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which has been vilified at all times and not to what has been hidden in the pre-school of resistance and violence on innocent children ’ s seals.
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out.
At the same time, however, I must protect Georg Ratzinger, because all of this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishment, that is, earnest and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger for the book "My brother the Pope"?
Is the subject of caning punishment?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI., tells from his perspective, since the domspatzen played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there.
But this must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without calling for unconditional discipline, he would hardly have been able to form an institution of world-class, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and bons alone, one makes nonsense singers no big singers and every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger on her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and always seen as a wonderful, humorous, trustworthy, deeply believable and heartfelt people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do something to do.
I regularly get in touch with him, 23 years after he was born.
Those who have not forgiven him that he has been strict with them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most domain names are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he always was a good, father-in-law teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but was also a loving respect for which they still stand up today and which they are honouring them.
I would like to make it quite clear once again: everything that is being accused of educating people who were on the agenda at that time.
We can be pleased that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
The report that has just been published relieves it.
Now, the decency of a 93-year-old man who has gained great merit and without the outside of Bayerns and perhaps Germany, nobody would know the Regensburg Domspatzen.
