Oil tanker " Stena Impero " left Iran 's port	-2.2787
More than two months after his arrest by the Iranian authorities , the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " left the port of Bandar Abbas this Friday , and , as ship observation data from Refinitiv showed , the tanker set off in motion and left the Iranian port .	-6.5041
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian Government on Monday , but it remained in Iranian waters at first , and the shipping company said that it wanted to wait for an official Tehran certificate .	-6.4382
The " Stena Impero " was raised under the charge by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Hormuz Strait on 19 July , in breach of security rules , but it was suspected that Iran was relying on the controversial temporary arrest of an Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar , which belonged to the United Kingdom .	-7.7379

The puzzle is solved : That 's why we can 't kitk ourselves .	-7.3594
A kind of brake in the Großhirn prevents people from tickling themselves , as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments on rats , as they said on Thursday evening , and progress has been made on why children are so fierce against kiting , only to demand more .	-9.5952
After all , it has also been shown why sewing alone triggers a kitzeling hand before touching a laugh , lying on a deep layer in the big hirn that triggers the laughter even while the kitzeln is waiting .	-11.4496

Iran Frees British Tankers	-1.4726
The UN General Debate did not solve the Iran conflict , but there is now a problem less : the Iran-held British oil tanker " Stena Impero " could once in ; it could be a in the Iranian president 's peace plan .	-8.1024
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " , which has been held in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July , is back in international waters .	-4.0906
The " Stena Impero " left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now travelling for medical examinations to Dubai , explained Reedereichef Erik Hånell .	-5.4211
We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law , as stated in a communication on Friday .	-4.7718
On 19 July , the Iranian Revolutionary Guards arrested the tanker under the charge of flouting provisions of the Persian Gulf Law , and seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September , and the remaining 16 crew members may well have done well , said Hånell . They would have acted professionally in the face of the difficult and exciting situation of the last ten weeks , and the shipping companies are now working to reconcile them with their families as soon as possible .	-9.5464
The British Government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar after the establishment of the ' Stena Impero ' : at the beginning of July , a supertanker with oil from Iran , which was supposed to have been destined for Syria , had been put on the chain , and the delivery was , according to the authorities , in breach of EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria , with reference to which the British had received it from the United States .	-10.4728

The Strait of Hormus is one of the most important maritime routes in the world , connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean .	-5.6124
The US withdrew from the international nuclear deal , which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and end its political and economic isolation . Since then , the US government has been using the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a tougher and different area of expanded agreement .	-8.2689
Because of the dispute over the " Stena Impero " and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia , the US is working on a coalition to protect the region 's merchant ships militarily .	-5.2147

India looks to its protectionist economic policies for a better future .	-2.6372
India would actually be predestined to become a " war winner . " Given the punitive tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese producers , foreign producers in the People 's Republic are forced to re-dispose , with financial chiefs of Asian companies considering relocating their production from China to another country , India in a poll conducted by the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives , but this has more than the vagaries of the Chinese-American trade war .	-11.8844
But now India itself has become Trump ’ s focus . From the whiff in the White House to the " Kingdom of Tariffs , " America has withdrawn the trade benefits for 2000 products from the emerging market in early June . The US is accusing India of prohibitively high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods , mobile phones , spirits , motorcycles , and more .	-7.6109
On the world map of the trade wars , India ’ s rides are , however , just a sideshow , and America is also the world ’ s largest democracy , fueling concern about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean through the security glasses . Against this background , a US penal tariff on India is unlikely , with Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who has just assumed a second five-year term of office , likely to weigh in safety .	-11.3750
The problem , however , lies elsewhere : the empirically entrenched thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has a serious standing in the socialist Republic of India ; Modi , too , whose reformist zeal is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has long been implicated in the multi-ethnic state by any entrepreneurial spirit ; firms are now receiving more rapid construction grants for buildings ; they benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure ; and a more casual insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the preconditions to liquidate companies with high debts more quickly .	-10.4377
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings ; from economic optics , India ’ s first five Modi years have seen much for the better , but trade policy has not done so , with little domestic , internationally uncompetitive , firms protecting against foreign suppliers imposing new barriers on the national conservative government .	-9.8764
In the West , Modi the Nimbus of the energetic reformer , who is radically renewing his country economically , is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like . At the heart of the " India First " -Advokat , but never discouraged by a protectionist economic policy , which prevents Indian firms from being forced to rid themselves of anachronistic processes and become part of global competition , thanks to the closure of their industries , are among the tribal electors of Modi 's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and the latent short-sighted politics . . , , , , , , , and , the , , , and , the , , the , the , , , , , the , the , the , , the , the , , , , , , , , , , , , the , the , , , the , the , , , the	-20.6624

" I just wanted to help him , everyone in this situation would have done the same , " said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone , when he was completely unexpectedly drawing the attention of the assembled journalists to himself .	-6.5124
He did this in the evening with emphasis - and much more intensely than he would have thought , because this heroism will remain in memory , because Zumal Dabo even gave his competitors Busby the lead in the goal and voluntarily took the last place - well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega , who had won this race , did not use it at the end of the day , because the goal was reached only with a lot of help by the coach , which was therefore disqualified at the end of the World Cup .	-18.1716

For online retailers , many repackaged packages are lost goods , while some 20 million returns end up in rubbish , but there is an alternative .	-6.6382
The finance ministry has shown online traders like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate back skillful products instead of destroying them .	-4.8387
While the company cannot be relieved of the value-added tax on donated goods , the ministry explained a question of the Green Party ’ s daily faction about which the newspaper of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday , traders might consider the market value of unsold returns so low that they would have to pay little or no value-added tax .	-11.1697
According to a study by the University of Bamberg , Germany ’ s citizens send back six packets of orders on the Internet , with around four per cent of goods – some 20 million products – ending up in rubbish , costing them extra money after the current legal situation , because the financial authorities assess contributions such as sales , which then amount to VAT .	-11.8835

Brexit debate is like a " walk in the park "	-2.4865
The fierce verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament , according to his top adviser , do not contribute to a climate of hatred . Compared to the pre-Brexit 2016 election campaign , the current controversy is a " walk in the park , " Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation . " We will enjoy , we will out of the EU , and we will win . "	-6.6816
Johnson had attacked Brexiteers in Parliament in the last few days , accusing them , among other things , of " betrayal " of the people , accusing them of putting MEPs at risk because they could become the targets of death threats , he did as a " humbug . "	-7.4892
Cummings said that the only way to restore calm was to let MEPs finally respect the British decision to leave the EU ; it is not surprising that people were upset that , three years after the referendum , Britain had still not left the EU .	-6.0450

The protesters in Cairo are demanding the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi .	-2.7732
In response to the protests in Egypt today , the government is reacting harshly : it is using harsh ammunition to shoot the population , socialize with more than 2,000 people in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in prison , yet Egypt has never been harmless . But , since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013 , the state apparatus is doing everything to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring .	-13.3389
But one of the triggers of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation , poverty , lack of prospects , and the sense of being stifled by one ’ s own government , driving millions onto the streets , and that is a problem that Sisi ’ s regime , no matter how hard it gets to grips with adversaries , has actually worsened .	-11.0326
Today , every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line , and since 2016 , the currency has lost more than half of its value , with the inflation rate at 10 % .

After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football Election , further accusations were made of the Fifa . Egypt was not – on a . , . .	-15.6119
Much of the Fifa has been proven to be deceitful in recent years : the World Cup awards , dubious plans of its president , Gianni Infantino , the generalized behavior of various corrupt officials . But the Fifa World Football Election has not yet been suspected of running neatly - if one refrains from believing that the voting national trainers and national team captains of member associations often vote for sympathy rather than objective judgment .	-13.2823
But , having complained to Nicaragua ’ s captain , he did not vote at all , further inconsistencies have emerged : Egypt complains that the voices of National trainer Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account . Indeed , they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview .	-5.8682
The Fifa apologizes that " the signatures on the electoral forms were in uppercase and therefore not valid " .	-7.1286

In the case of Egypt , the Sudanese Association admits that trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally traded : with Lionel Messi in place one , Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three .

Nicaragua ’ s captain , Juan Barrera , also had allegations : “ Don ’ t vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards . All the information on my vote is wrong , thank you , ” he wrote .	-7.0325
On Friday , the announcement came from the Association : ' Vote , but of course there was no intention ' .

Ukraine-affairs : Ranghohe Republicans are in favor of official investigation .	-4.0581
Two senior Republicans have openly advocated an official investigation against US President Donald Trump , and I think the investigation is important , " said the Republican governor of the state of Vermont , Phil Scott . " Where that leads from here , the facts will be determined , " he wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken .	-11.5993
Scott said that he was not surprised by the revelations , which showed that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine , according to Scott , " since years . "	-5.4992
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the whistle-blower affair , but few have discerned unease , so Scotts ’ remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party , with Trump ’ s moderate governor of Virginia repeatedly opposing Trump ’ s policies , such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules .	-8.0293
He also spoke to Charlie Baker , Governor of Massachusetts , for the investigation . " It is a deeply disturbing situation , " he said . " The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom . "	-7.2381
Scott and Baker , as governor of US states , have formally no say in the proceedings against Trump that will be decided in Congress , so what you have said is above all symbolic , but first senators of the Republicans have also been critical of the situation . Mitt Romney , for example , who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament , said that the case is " extremely disturbing , deeply disturbing " . US media also report that the Republicans are beginning to revolt internally .	-9.9890
The affair could culminate in the inauguration of an impeachment procedure against Trump , which Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced to investigate , accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political gain .	-6.5068
For the impeachment process , there is no precise timetable ; with its majority in the House of Representatives , Democrats could make a so-called “ impeachment . ” The decision to remove a real term but in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority , so the prospects for such a process ’ s success are slim .	-13.3368

Three men have been arrested in Sicily and are said to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps .	-3.0369
The German captain Carola Rackete ( 31 ) was arrested in June after being fired on board the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 Libyan refugees .	-4.6079
According to new serious allegations against Rackete , three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the " Sea-Watch 3 . " The suspects were arrested in camp in Messina ( Sicily ) after migrants had recognized their tormentin Italy . " We cannot rule this , but we ourselves no reliable information , " said " Sea Watch " corresponnewly-rebof the German press agency .	-9.0061
It was said by the police in mid-September that the suspects were raped , tortured , and even murdered in the North African country ; it was Mohammed C.

" The migrants were systematically harassed and atrocities subjected - repeated and permanent physical violence , " it was said at the time in the communication .	-6.4898

Musk seeks extradition records with Tesla	-3.0135
Tesla CEO Elon Musk gave a powerful boost to the stock market with the prospect of new record figures to his electric car company .	-5.3784
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries , " Musk wrote in an e-mail published by the industry blog " Electrek " to Tesla staff .	-3.7522
The demand was strong , so that Tesla could buy 110,000 , Musk ’ s newsletters continued to say that the challenge was to get cars to the clientele as quickly as possible , and that Tesla should offer as many resources as possible to the quarters .	-10.1736
In the second quarter , Tesla delivered 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous record .	-10.4031
In order to achieve its high goals , Musk wants to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars in 2019 , but in the current and coming quarter of the year , six numbers are required , especially the cheapest Tesla model 3 , but here the profit margins are low , despite the boom there were losses .	-11.2431
US Budgeting : Renews only a bridge-financing .	-4.6952
The new budget year will start on 1 October in the United States without a proper budget , with the Senate following Thursday 's House of Representatives and deciding on transitional financing by 21 November .	-5.1501
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed to raise spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years in August , the United States will face a new fiscal year , starting on October 1 , with no more spending plans , followed by a transitional financing ( Continuing Resolution , CR ) by November 21 , followed by a resolution on Monday at midnight on a shutdown that would close the federal administration .	-8.6620
Shutdown Depends	-2.5570
For the time being , the federal administration is being financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 to come at the end of Monday , because Congress did not agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate funds to the various departments and authorities , and therefore the federal administration cannot benefit from the new budget year of 1.3 Bios on $ 1.4 .	-9.3496
The Democrats in the House of Representatives , where they have the majority , have completed ten of the twelve laws , but the spending laws reflect Democrats ’ priorities , which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate .	-4.6592
In the Senate , the Republicans seem to be trying to force $ 12 billion for the Mauerbau , one of Trump ’ s big priorities . The Democrats are bothering with the wall plans and their financing , which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects .	-8.2517
The Ghosts of Mauerbau	-2.8914
At the moment , it is unclear how the parties will approach this issue , and probably as an agreement on all 12 spending laws in the next seven weeks , extending the transitional financing beyond 21 November is also a shutdown , given that it is not excluded .	-8.3085
Against the backdrop of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time , and the danger of a shutdown , ideas are gaining ground to automate the process of popularity . Template 1877 to avoid Shutdown would automatically reduce federal administration funding to the previous year ’ s level , prevent parliamentarians ’ travel , and hold back their wages until the new annual spending plans .	-7.9058
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles	-2.3600
In France , the artificial insemination of women and lesbians who live in the future is to be revealed : the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a bill from the government , according to which all women can avail themselves of in-vitro insemination , thereby considerably increasing demand for anonymous sperm donation .	-8.7225
In the three-day emotional debate , critics in the right camp warned that in the future many " children without father " could grow up .	-5.8126
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law , which Secretary of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as an " opportunity " for society .	-6.0675
Restoration with sperm from dead husband further prohibited	-4.0534
By a narrow majority , the National Assembly rejected an amendment designed to give widows artificial fertilization access to the sperm of their dead man . In Belgium , Spain , and the United Kingdom , artificial fertilization of " post-mortem " is permitted .	-6.4845
Many members of the governing party La République en Marche ( The Republic in Movement , LREM ) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition opposed the artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased , arguing that a widow would be " a double trauma " if her husband 's death also filled her child 's wish .	-8.4494
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that , although a widow may in future be infertile with the semen of an unknown , it cannot be infertile with that of her own partner .	-7.3118
So far , artificial fertilization in France has only allowed heterosexual couples who cannot witness children ; they must be married or live together for at least two years ; Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be banned .	-6.2429
In Germany , artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples .	-4.5271

The debate on a climate tax on flights from universities and universities , which was postponed before the summer recess , is reviving , and , having reacted skeptically to a corresponding push from the Green Black coalition , plans are now receiving support from universities and , in a joint declaration , the PhD students of six universities in Baden-Württemberg and a pedagogical college are arguing for a compensation of service flights , which is a first step that is urgently needed , while at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights , in other words , in their opinion , which was originally in in July , because the CDU has still .	-18.0901

The US government wants to reduce the already-historically low limit on the admission of new refugees , with the US now running from October 2019 to September 2020 , leaving at most 18,000 people in the country , as the US State Department has said .	-7.6689
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has slashed the appetite for protection from all over the world in recent years . Under Barack Obama ’ s previous administration , far higher caps were golden .	-5.9157
The estimated ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee program in 1980 , while the State Department described the US as " the most impoverished and generous nation in history , " a phrase strongly reminiscent of the language used by the incumbent US president .	-6.1074
A " responsible handling " of refugees aims to ensure that refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild them , Trump explained .	-17.6937
One big contentious point is the border with Mexico , which Trump wants to seal off . To finance the construction of a border wall , Trump had imposed the National Emergency Board . Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear . Trump is currently under threat of impeachment because of the Selenskyj affair and possibly an impending impeachment .	-7.5203

Iranian President Hassan Ruhani , on his return from the UN General Assembly , spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions . The United States , in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership , had offered an end to all sanctions , declared Ruhani on its official website .	-5.7946
US President Donald Trump , however , contradicted Iran 's counterpart on Twitter : " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there is a meeting .	-8.8770
Roughly speaking , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , British Prime Minister Boris Johnson , and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and would have insisted that a meeting should take place , " and America says I am lifting the sanctions , " supplemented Ruhani .

Inspired by Franz Kafka ’ s famous narrative , “ The Transformation ” , the UK ’ s successful author , Ian McEwan ( 71 ) , has written a book about Brexit chaos in the UK .	-4.8267
The novel " Die Kakerlake " ( Original : " The Cockroach " ) will be published on November 27 in German , Diogenes Verlag ( Zurich ) informed the relatives of a man called " Jim Sams " , who was ignored or hated in his previous life , but who is once the most powerful man in the United Kingdom .	-6.3056
McEwan was quoted as saying : ' If Parliament is closed , so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment , if ministers are lying shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once , if Brexiteers are in high positions to cause the catastrophe of a no-deal , then a writer has to ask what he can do , there is only one answer to that : . McEwan was published in the spring of the novel " Macharts intelligence " .	-8.8596
Kafka 's first published narrative in 1915 is written by Gregor Samsa , who wakes up one morning and sees himself " transformed into an immense nephew " , and is excluded from the family and society , and finally perished .

Stocking Brexit Negotiations : The Danger of a No-Deals remains acute	-6.9809
In fact , Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly set out : he will not be allowed a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations , but what accounts for the eternal duration of Britain ’ s polarizing Britons . The UK ’ s recent Supreme Court judgment a sword of Damocles over the blond , his suspension of parliament to carry out his Brexit course until the exit date , was annulled at earlier this week , a bill passed by Parliament to force Johnson to negotiate with the EU until 31 October .	-10.8365
Boris Johnson still thinks Deal is possible .	-3.0584
But the pressure does not seem to pass Johnson either : he has made it clear during a visit to a hospital that , if he fails to agree by the end of October , he will support prolonging negotiations :	-7.6642

And the time for Brexit negotiators in Brussels is beginning to run out , with the EU and the British negotiators having some six weeks to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement , but the recent talks have failed again . An agreement by the end of October seems more difficult to envisage . British Prime Minister Bricht ’ s law does not imply a renewed postponement of the exit date , but the opposition does not fear that Johnson might somehow prevail in the case of a no-deal than Brexit .	-10.9288

On September 20 , protesters gathered around Tahrir Square .	-2.7731
On the one hand , an open protest had not occurred in Egypt for years ; according to the Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , nearly 2000 people have been arrested since last week , many of whom have been arbitrarily arrested - only because they were " at the wrong time in the wrong place " , according to the appeal to lawyers in Festgenommener .	-9.7637

Teure Spaghetti in Rome : Tourists paid for noodles 430 euros	-2.7649
430 euros for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome : this seemed to two Japanese tourists too much .	-5.0268
" Such cases damage the reputation of Rome , we call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud , " a spokesman of Federagit , the leader of the travel agency in Rome , according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero ( Friday edition ) .	-7.5609

A call in Ukraine , and everything is broken ? US President Donald Trump may indeed face impeachment after the turbulent revelations of the past few days that Democrats want to examine with their inquiry into the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is a matter of weeks until a decision would .	-7.0641
At the beginning of the scandal , the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is supposedly on the verge of whistleblowers , who have raised concerns about national security and about US democracy with his complaint to the public : the president has abused the power of his office to exploit the government of another country to influence the 2020 election , using Ukraine ’ s dependence on the press , thereby forcing it to actively oppose a political opponent .	-10.1847
The core of this project is also to be seen in the interview with Selenskyj , which has now been published , even though it does not reflect the full text . The phone on on July 25 is just an episode of a much larger story , at the center of which is Trump , above all , his personal lawyer : Rudy Giuliani .	-9.0634
The story is from the point of view of the public in May 2019 , when the New York Times reports from Rudy Giuliani 's travel plans to Ukraine ; he wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj , and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are tricky . ' We are not interfering in an election , we are interfering in an investigation to what we have the right to say , he says the newspaper .	-8.4738
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixed on Trump ’ s opponent in the 2016 election : Hillary Clinton has colluded with actors in Ukraine , and critics have said that he has never been serious about investigating the US .	-6.8518
The Giulianis and the president ’ s version reads : The former vice-president and now aspiring candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy , Joe Biden , has been relegated to the dismissal of Ukraine ’ s then-General Prosecutor Viktor Schokin as a Ukraine-Beauftragter of the Obama administration ’ s Obama administration , in order to stop the gas-company investigation that his son Hunter Biden did .	-10.3657
In fact , the process was somewhat different ; when Joe Biden called for Ukraine ’ s Attorney General to go , the investigations against the gas company had already been completed , Hunter Biden had never been directly affected , and even deeply corrupt charges leveled by the US government were far from being the only Western partner pushing for his release . Moreover , the Obama administration explicitly supported the investigations against the company .	-8.6223

Will the British government circumvent Brexit ?	-3.0167
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is wondering whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the last law passed by Parliament against an unbridled Brexit . On a related issue , he said on Friday to journalists that his government would be complying with the law .	-8.0196
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the exit date , should not reach an agreement with the EU by mid-October , as Johnson criticizes this as a ' surrender law ' that creates negotiations with the EU .	-6.7920
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political bullying " to circumvent the law ; Johnson could use a procedural trick that shifted the law 's entry into force to the EU after leaving .	-6.0855
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union , " We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October , and the best way is to reach an agreement . "	-4.2324
Iran appears to be receiving uranium enrichment at a high level .	-4.1804
Iran 's President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on Europe 's contractual partners in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement , " Unfortunately , European states are incapable or unwilling to take concrete action , " said Rouhani on Thursday at a press conference on the fringes of the UN General Assembly in New York .	-7.2188
Against this background , the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb that , in exchange for Tehran ’ s promise to normalize economic relations , the US rose from the deal alone in 2018 to force Iran to “ maximize pressure ” to change course in the Middle East policy , which the administration of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new deal with tougher conditionality , and is now relying on tough sanctions against Tehran . Iran recently responded with a revival of the limited uranium enrichment treaty .	-9.9916
The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using uranium to install centrifuges at the beginning of September , or at least has prepared for use , and , according , Iran more than 300 .	-5.0846
Perhaps Europeans are not prepared to bear their share of the deal , so the Iranians left alone with the costs and burden of crushing US sanctions , Rouhani presumed , but there will be further talks , hopefully a solution .	-7.1163
Rouhani continues to engage Iran in attacks in Saudi Arabia	-1.7144
But the carnage has changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September : Germany , France , and the United Kingdom followed on Monday ’ s US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack . Originally , Iran-backed Huthi rebels had committed themselves to Yemen ’ s attack , but what the US saw as a false commitment . ” We have nothing to , ” RouRouon on Wednesday .	-8.4041
" Those who make such accusations must provide evidence , " Rouhani said . European leaders would not have skillfully engaged in talks with him during the UN General Debate ; instead , they would have merely invoked the rebels in Yemen to launch an attack like this , but Rouhani had met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , French President Emmanuel Macron , and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days .	-7.5976
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump , the US administration ’ s far-reaching sanctions would have to be lifted , Rohani demanded that the Washington administration switch to a " dialogue and reason " policy .	-6.1808
Comet crossed by other star solar system	-3.6953
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the deep depths of the outer space , which was only once successful .	-7.3726
What initially was only a conjecture is now confirmed : an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system .	-10.7089
The largest comet was discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory on the Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter .	-5.0960
2I / Borisov is after 1I / ' Oumuamua of 2017 only the second interstellar object that was sighted at a passage of our solar system .	-4.4245
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close insights into a strange solar system before it disappears on Nimmerwiedersehen .	-6.2624
The comet , according to the analyses , travels on a so-called hyperbole which leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin , as the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) communicated ; it is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies ; in honour of its , the interstellar swe, first below the number C / 2019 Q4 , the designation of , the first part of the name indicates that is the second object that in our system .	-9.6718
In contrast to 1I / ' Oumuamua , 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in the first half of the year , leaving the researchers for many months to study . ' The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will be visible by April 2020 with large telescopes , " Farnocchia explained , " after which it will be open until October 2020 only with larger , professional telescopes .	-9.4095
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor , so a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii , who had already redirected the characterization of 1I / ' Oumuamua , in a first survey conducted the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometers .	-6.9273
Researchers from the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands ( IAC ) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum of interstellar welders , which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition . " The spectrum of this object resembles that of comets of our solar system , and this indicates that its composition must be similar " , reported IAC researcher Julia de León .	-6.8999
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within only two years suggests , according to the IAU , that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems .	-5.6180

Uproar in Washington : Trump wants anonymous tippers in Ukraine-affairs .	-3.2861
In the Ukraine affair about the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump , Trump wants to open up possible leaks in the White House .	-5.7478
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information , " Trump said on Thursday before staff of the U.S. Mission at the United Nations in New York .	-4.4463
The event was not actually public , but several US media broadcasted audio cuts of the speech on Friday , with Democrats reacting indignant to the president ’ s statement .	-8.1992
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced on Tuesday preparations for an impeachment procedure against Trump , based mainly on a written complaint by an anonymous intelligence worker , who levies heavy charges against Trump and his administration headquarters .	-12.6143
In his work , Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government officials that the US president " uses the power of his office " to achieve a different country to meddle in his favor in the 2020 US election .	-5.2675
At the heart of the accusations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July , in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate the political rivals Joe Biden , who are dealing with former shops by Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his brother from Ukraine ’ s judiciary .	-6.7844
The whistleblowers accused the White House of using the Ukrainian telephone at the same time as cover-up : senior government officials would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the blanket , as is customary for an electronic word record to be made , according to the conversation on instructions from lawyers from the White House but usually from a database removed and stored in a specially protected system instead .	-20.6780
" The New York Times " reported that it should be a member of the CIA 's foreign secret service .	-5.8477
In a series of tweets on the theme , the president wrote , among other things , that the “ whistleblower ” had disseminated second-hand information that would have turned out to be inaccurate , so perhaps there would be no tippers or spies .	-7.8978
As Trump said in New York about those who have received the whistleblower information , outrage aroused , but US House Chair Nancy Pelosi reacted alarmingly and lamented Trump ’ s assertion that the government ’ s integrity was once again undermined .	-7.7892
In the House of Representatives , various committees have been investigating Trump and his environment for months now . With the accusations of Ukraine , Democrats are now proceeding to investigate new anger to launch a possible impeachment against Trump .	-7.1617
" The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation , " said the Chief Intelligence Committee in the House of Representatives , Adam Schiff . Trump attacked ship sharply , accused him of misrepresenting things , and called again for the resignation of the committee chairman .	-8.0703
More than 300 former US government officials from the security and foreign-policy spheres , most of them under democratic , but also under Republican presidents , presented themselves in a Friday statement behind the Democratic inquiry for a possible impeachment process . If the allegations were true , it would be " an unscrupulous abuse of power " by Trump .	-8.2156
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure ; with its majority in the House of Representatives , Democrats could start a so-called “ impeachment process . ” The decision on effective impeachment , but in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority , so the prospects for success in such a process are slim .	-12.6376
VW works council : Jobs are " creeping " dismantled .	-3.3591
The VW brand ’ s plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe , a concern that drives the car ’ s works council to cut annual factory costs from € 10 billion to € 2023 billion by € 2 billion , saving € 500 million this year .	-7.3160
A key to this is staffing costs , and the " Future Pact " negotiated between companies and works councils foresees a reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020 .	-6.9677
However , as our newspaper now learns from working councils , jobs are being lost in production , which is not actually going to be dislocated , ' creeping ' across another path - that is , passing the official course - so that vacant regular posts are often not filled again .	-10.5427

2I / Borisov : Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers on the Crimea	-2.1331
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer called Gennadi Borissow on the Crimea .	-4.5270
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get a glimpse of a strange solar system from close quarters .	-7.8222
Komet was already sighted in front of Anflug - and can be observed several months .	-4.4810
But before it is so far , astronomers can observe it in detail , because unlike its predecessor , 2I / Borisov has already been spotted in its first glimpse , meaning that it can be examined for many months from Earth . " The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and will be seen by April 2020 with medium sized telescopes , " says Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa .

She was particularly encouraged by the fact that her brother , Jo Cox , mentioned that a pro-EU House of Commons who had been murdered a few days before the 2016 Leave referendum by a neo-Nazi , was best placed to honor her memory by going through Brexit , and Boris Johnson , in the House of Commons , said , " It is very distasteful to refer to an MEP who was murdered by someone who called Britain first , " now criticized Johnson 's sister .

An actor and Youtuber sets Egyptians ruler : for the time being , Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad .	-5.0377
The two men who have an influence on whether blood is flowing back on Egypt 's streets last week spent both abroad , one from both floating back at Cairo airport on Friday . President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly . The ex-general who resigned in 2013 from the Muslim Brotherhood of Mohammed Mursi , the first freely elected leader of the country , canceled a pleasant time in New York : US President Donald Trump had spurned Sisi 's actions against political Islam , and had no silos about human rights violations on Nile - a week ago , in Egypt 's security forces , hundreds of people arrested because they had not dared to marry the President of Egypt .	-12.0814
In the mistaken - which , according to the President of the other man who is currently driving the streets - Mohamed Ali was , of course , abroad , deprived of access to the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil .	-9.6817
He goes directly to the head of state and in a very rustic language , and while the people are starving , the President is floating in luxury and allowing themselves to build magnificent new palaces , that is to say , because the army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule accuses Ali corruption and enrichment , because in his second profession as a builder he spent for 15 years with these very masters , he seems to know quite well what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians , as the exploding clicks show .	-11.6314
After Sisi ’ s grip on power demonstrated thousands against his rule last week , and nearly 2000 citizens , including prominent figures from civil society , human rights lawyers , and opposition politicians , were arrested , Ali called for a “ Millionenmarsh ” on this Friday , so that so many people would really dare to march on the streets , but there were small protests , for example in Giseh near Kairo , and in the city of Kina near Luxor , videos in social media that protested against Al Sisi ’ s corruption , calling for his exit . These protests also left the police with teargas and rubber shots .	-11.8385
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta , where protesters rallied last week with the president 's portrait in pieces , a massive police presence was reported on Friday . Security forces rallied checkpoints in the city and on the streets of the exterior . In Cairo , several underground stations in the city center were closed for " maintenance work " , most roads around the Tahrir Square , the heart of the 2011 revolution , were blocked , and on Rabaa Square , where followers of the ousted Muslim Brotherhood Morsi disappeared until the army took fire and killed up to 800 people , a different measure was intended to prevent disaffection : Sisi ’ s Future Party Party was supposed to rally for the president .	-16.2000
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactic : " Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square , " Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera . " Let us not join forces with police officers . " But he not : " Egypt is the Tahrir Square . "	-7.8715
If Provider promises Too much Performance	-2.9101
If the Internet connection is always much slower than the provider advertises , there are different test possibilities .	-6.0449
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not need to have blind faith in the speed specifications of the providers , and customers can check for themselves when they find themselves , how much of this is actually being achieved .	-9.2749

First Obligatory Republicans for Investigation	-4.0528
As the first senior Republican , Governor of Vermont has called for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump .

Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine , because Trump has been observing the " years " .	-4.4251
Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the whistle-blower affair ; few have discerned unease , so Scotts ’ remarks are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party . Scott , a moderate Republican , has already turned several times against Trump ’ s policies , for example , against relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules .	-7.5269
