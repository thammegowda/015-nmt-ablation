Removing French Chemical Plant Brand
The fire in a chemical plant in the town of Rouen in northern France was extinguished, and the Normandy prefecture was informed on Friday.
Halting the Fire
The factory is part of the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU Seveso Directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemical factory had already made headlines in the past, for example, when a leak leaked the gas from methanthiol in 2013 and the surrounding area went far into bad eggs. In 2015, after an industrial accident, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil went into the city ’ s wastewater system.
She announces her job to search 57 days for her missing bitch.
For two months a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and announced her job.
She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went for dinner, and when they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared, looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder ’ s Dog Panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception.
"I never gave up hope," said Carole King to the Daily Inter Lake, who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.

"When King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared, and suddenly her bitch stood under a tree.
Loss in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without trace.
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine guns.
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has lost 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and almost 20,000 shot munitions.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one arms section and 3474 shot munitions have reappeared.
The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundeswehr) has announced that the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundeswehr) has signed an agreement with the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundeswehr).
Oil tanker Stena Impero left Iranian Port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas this Friday.
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian Government on Monday, but initially it remained in Iranian waters.
The "Stena Impero" was charged on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz with violating security rules, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker before the British-owned Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the world ’ s most important shipping routes, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean, and shipping much of the world ’ s oil exports through the straits. Tensions in the region have intensified enormously over the past few months, and merchant shipping has been dragged into the US-Iran conflict, with several incidents involving tankers and drones.

Musk Waits for Delivery Record
Tesla ’ s quarter may be holding a record; despite the delivery boom, losses in the electric car group have been reported.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
Tesla has a strong demand for 110000 orders, according to Musk ’ s newsletter.
In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 950,000 cars, reaching its previous peak.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals, and in 2019 he plans to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars, with six-figure figures in the current and next quarter, especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3, but here the profit margins are low.
Solving puzzles: That ’ s why we cannot tickle ourselves.
A kind of brake in the brain prevents people from ticking themselves, as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening, with progress being made on why children are so fiercely opposed to tickling, only to demand more.
After all, it has also been shown why only the sewing of a tickling hand causes laughter before touching, lying on a deep layer in the hive, which causes laughter when waiting for the tickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are kicked by humans.
Laughter is suppressed while Self-Contact
The researchers of Berlin have now found in the experiments on the rats that the laughter and the activity of the area of the brain ring are suppressed during a self-touch, even if living creatures are plastering themselves.
However, if self-touch and contact through others at the same time is also suppressed, this indicates that the rat's brain cannot distinguish between self-touch and contact by others.
In addition, the rats had been trained to tickle themselves, and so in the experiment they sometimes broke off this initiation, showing escape behaviour or scaremongering.
Removing catastrophe: Removing large-scale French chemical plant
AFP ’ s news agency, AFP, announced today that it has announced that it will be launching a new campaign to address the issue.
According to official data, no hazardous substances should have been released, and the samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning, when no one was; the fire was with about.
Schools and nurseries were closed
Local residents were asked not to leave their homes, buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

The factory is part of the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU Seveso Directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.

Brexit: Johnson ’ s Own Sister
The prime minister ’ s sister commented on Boris Johnson ’ s speech in Parliament ’ s first session after the forced break on Wednesday evening, when the prime minister threatens to lead the country from the EU without an agreement on October 31 if Brussels does not agree to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement, but how he will achieve that is unclear.
Through Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: 'The best way to honour Jo Cox's memory and unite that country would be to leave the EU'. Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Remembering the Oslo and Utoya attacks
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya, with 77 dead, a memorial in honour of the victims will be unveiled on Saturday in Norway.
The project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled in the same place - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims.
On 22 July 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first fired a car bomb in the government district of Oslo, and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the Social Democratic Workers Party ’ s Youth Organization on the island of Utoya, killing 77 people in the attacks.
Iran Frees British Tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict, but now there is less of a problem, and the Iranian-held British oil tanker "Stena Impero" could once again be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Rouhani's peace plan. the were. were,, and. were.,, and.
Stena Impero, a British oil tanker held in the Strait of Hormus in Iran in mid-July, is back in international waters.
The crew of the "Stena Impero" left Bandar Abbas's port and now, among other things, are going to Dubai for medical investigations, said Reedereisef Erik Hånell.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a Friday communication.
According to Hånell, seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September, and the remaining 16 crew members were doing well in accordance with the circumstances.
The British Government suspected a similar incident in Gibraltar following the establishment of the Stena Impero: at the beginning of July a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, had been set in the chain, and the delivery, according to the authorities, failed to comply with EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria.
In the mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released, and London vehemently rejected allegations that it was a bargain to free the "Stena Impero".
The Strait of Hormus is one of the world ’ s most important shipping routes, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean, and shipping much of the world ’ s oil exports through the straits. Tensions in the region have intensified enormously in recent months, and merchant shipping has been dragged into the US-Iran conflict, with several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries, with the Americans accusing Iran ’ s leaders of wanting to build nuclear weapons, which Iran rejects. The US had unilaterally withdrawn from the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which was supposed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pressuring Iran ’ s leaders into imposing massive economic sanctions to impose a tougher and more extended agreement on other areas.
Due to the dispute over the Stena Impero and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
In view of the punitive tariffs imposed on Chinese manufacturers by America's President Donald Trump, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reassess, with Asian leaders considering moving their production from China to another country, India appears to be one of the preferred alternatives in a survey by UBS, but this has nothing to do with the vagaries of the Sino-American trade war, with a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers creating India as a way to play a more important role in the globally wide production chain.
But now India has become Trump ’ s focus, with the White House hoarding as the “Kingdom of Tariffs, ” America removed the emerging-market country ’ s trade preferences for 2000 products in early June, with the US accusing India of prohibitively high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, however, friction with India is nothing but a sideshow, and America also views the world ’ s largest democracy through its security glasses. Delhi and Washington share concerns about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvage of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely, and India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just assumed a second term in office for five years, is likely to prevail.
But the problem lies elsewhere: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development is a difficult one in the Socialist Republic of India, and in Modi, too, its reform zeal is aimed mainly at the bureaucratic madness that has stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long; firms are now receiving faster construction permits for buildings; they benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure; and a more griffy insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for liquidating seemingly dead companies with high levels of debt.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings, but much of has changed for the better in India over five modes.
In the West, Modi hangs on the nimbus of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what Western managers ’ vocabulary is. At its core, however, the India First Advokat never depended on protectionist economic policies, preventing Indian firms from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus fit for global competition, while businessmen who survive thanks to the closure of their industries are among the tribal constituencies of Modi ’ s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and lament this short-sighted policy.
Insertion of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac is to be buried in Paris next week, and the former Head of State will be buried at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital on Monday, according to the AFP news agency, referring to the Chirac family, with the funeral being in the close family.
Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships.
In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to waver dangerously, barely standing on his legs 300 meters before the goal, ran into an unhealthy attitude when Braima Suncar Dabo, from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau, suddenly stopped him and propelled him to the last half stage round.
"I just wanted to help him, and everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he drew the attention of the assembled journalists, shying away first, didn't want to talk about his heroism at all, after all he wanted to set up his personal best time, and when he realized that this would be difficult, he just wanted to help a loved one, and anyway he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited by the World Cup, and in normal circumstances he should not even have started., ",, I,,, and.
In the end, Dabo was disqualified by the World Athletics Association, just five minutes after the Ethiopians Selemion Barega, who won the race.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, had come to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha.
Millions of Migrants: Egyptians are preparing for Wild Protest Day.
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible anti-government protests.
In the last few days, the police had stepped up their road controls, and pedestrians' mobile phones were partially searched for news and photos related to the protests, hundreds of which were arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, hundreds of people protested against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who accused critics of corruption and mismanagement.
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) reported more than 1,570 arrests until Friday.
Arbitrary arrests
HRW has been accused of being "arbitrarily arrested", "just because they were" in the wrong place at the wrong time ", and has been accused of detention on the basis of lawyers.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, so the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealers: Mailing Dealers Should Donate Returns Easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods, leaving around 20 million returns to waste, but there is an alternative.
The Treasury has shown online traders like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products rather than destroy them.
Although companies could not be exempt from the VAT on material donations, the ministry raised a question from the Green Party group, which was reported by the radio media group newspapers on Friday, but traders could set the market value of unsold returns so low that they would have to pay no or little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens would return every sixth package of Internet orders, with around four per cent of the goods - around 20 million products - then dumped, and donating it would cost companies additional money under current law, because the financial authorities rate contributions like a turnover on which sales tax would then accrue.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called for Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear by a decree that companies can evaluate non-saleable products and donate them to non-profit organisations free of charge.
Banksy Art for Auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting.
The well-known work of Streetart-star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to be auctioned off soon.
For Branczik, Banksy ’ s work emphasizes the “reconstitution of the world ’ s oldest parliamentary democracy into the animal and tribal attitudes ”.
The work was first exhibited in the Museum of Bristol in the south-west of the United Kingdom, where Banksy lives.
The image could change the owner for a million euros.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at his first meeting in the House of Commons on Wednesday following the repeal of Johnson ’ s forced recess by the Supreme Court, came up with a crackdown with the opposition, and Johnson wants to see Brexit, already postponed twice on October 31, without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in the south-east of England, he painted a picture representing a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a knife, seeing thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom every day.
The Brexit Debate is like a Park Walk
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’ s violent verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy it, we will leave (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament hard in recent days, accusing them of, among other things, "treason," on the people, making accusations that it could put MEPs at risk because they could, for example, become targets for death threats, a "humbug."
Cummings said that the only way to restore calm was if MEPs finally respected Britain ’ s decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that the UK had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
On Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint in the face of the convoluted mood. 'We should talk with respect', a statement said.,, and,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Khan Calls for Uno Intervention in Kashmir
In an emotional appeal, Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If that is going badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst," The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir, and both nuclear powers control part of Kashmir, another part of which belongs to China. In early August, India had stripped the region of Indian Kashmir of its autonomous status, dramatically increasing tensions with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo are demanding the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government ’ s response to the current protests in Egypt is a tough one, with heavy ammunition firing on the population, more than 2000 detainees joining the 60,000 political prisoners already in prison, and protests in Egypt have never been safe. But, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything it can to avoid a scenario like the one in the Arab Spring.
But one of the causes of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation: poverty, lack of prospects, and the sense of being stifled by one ’ s own government drove millions to the streets, and that is a problem that El-Sisi ’ s regime, no matter how tough it is against adversaries, has even deteriorated.
Today, one in three people in Egypt lives below the poverty line; since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is at 10%; if you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide whom to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola, or the military, which is not only responsible for repression, but is also the biggest economic actor. The military is building roads, houses, football stadiums, food production, and a to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tv-checks at the terminal: BER boss: No more "showstoppers" for the main city airport.
The operator is satisfied with the course, but the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
After large-scale Tüv checks at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year, as was certain, said Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control panel.
Airport Chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there are still deficiencies to be dealt with in the terminal.
However, there are indications that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large, and the notification of construction completion will now be submitted to the construction authority during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of electrical cables have yet to be remedied; the Tüv wants to examine them by February.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is a question of missing proof, less of new cables, and that there is still no clearance for nononozzles on which the cable lines hang.
In addition, the fire protection at the crossing to the station under the terminal has not yet worked satisfactorily, and the problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago, this time about smoke burns that go down like a screen in a fire, so that the smoke does not spread out, so that 36 engines will have to be replaced, so that at the beginning of the year there will be new tests with hot gas smoke.
The airport was originally scheduled to be operational in 2011, and costs increased from two billion euros to approximately 6.5 billion euros in the opening of next year since the start.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those in charge are planning to expand the airport, which is what the Chairman of the Supervisory Board announced at a special meeting on 18 October.
The airport company is now looking for two new Managing Directors: Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster moves to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Head of Human Resources Manfred Bobke-von Camen retires next year, as Bretschneider said, and thanked F.
Chemnitz: Automates for Drugs Sharped - Police Takes Man
He needed money for drugs - and hunted several vending machines into the air in the city of Chemnitz!
Over the past two years, the number of blown cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply, causing millions of euro damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police struck a 33-year-old German at Bu rgerstraße and on the further street in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation of the explosion of explosives in the unit of the crime with a particularly severe case of theft carried out by the Chemnitzer criminal police, this suspicion was not only confirmed against the 33-year-old".
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer has now committed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesperson: "The bomber seems to have been used to finance its antidote dependence." The bomber had blown up parking between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage incurred is at least EUR 60 000!
The automatic bomber is now in custody, and police investigations against him are continuing.
He was also responsible for other vending machines in Chemnitz and neighbouring counties.
AUA takes over Eurowing flights from Vienna
In the middle of the price struggle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA "takes over the commercial control of all Eurowing flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday a press officer of Austrian Airlines with respect to APA.
The Lufthansa Lufthansa airline Eurowing will be operating in Vienna from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowing personnel.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA turnstile and network planning, the speaker explained.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "Production Company" for the Group's sister AUA.
In the summer of 2006, the airline announced that it would be able to fly four Ryanair aircraft including crews to Vienna, also known as "Wetlease", which the union criticized as a circumvention construction for the collective agreement.
On Friday, Michael O'Leary's challenge that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, Andreas Otto, CEO of the AUA, said: "We will remain number one at the site in five, six or ten years' time". the will the.

Study of Heart Disease
There are risks to cardiovascular diseases, but what really causes a heart weakness or an infarction?
Through the analysis of the genetic material of 9000 people, hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, announced by the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday.
Although obesity, smoking, and unhealthy nutrition are among the major determinants of the risk of cardiovascular disease, genetic factors contribute to the risk.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the roughly 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-causing changes in DNA – so-called mutations – called the clinic.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. data,, and, as,,, and,, and.

The first gene sequence in the world, the results of which were published in 2001, cost hundreds of millions of euros.
Nigeria ’ s Police frees hundreds of ill-treated boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school, and, following indications from local residents, security forces went through school in the north Nigerian Kadand discovered the victims, some of whom were, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The were and were,,, and. were,,,,,,,,,,,,
The young had been detained on the pretext of being taught and 'improved' in the Koran.
According to the data, the Koran school had existed for about ten years, and residents would have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the establishment, and the parents would have shown themselves to be shocked when they were informed of the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said, they had not been aware of the suffering of their children, and the operator and six staff were arrested by the police.
There are many private Koran schools in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, replacing the often deficient state institutions, with the region ’ s people suffering from frequent attacks by armed gangs, which, according to the UN Refugee Agency, has led to more than 40,000 people crossing the border to Niger.

World Football Battle: Further charges of Messis and Klops Kür
Football "Signature Not Valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded the prize.
With a gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year.
After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he had never voted in the World Cup election, charges have been levelled at Fifa from other countries, and Egypt has not been rated on a strange grounds.
In recent years, much of Fifa ’ s work has proved to be deceitful: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its President, Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials.
But, having already complained that Nicaragua ’ s captain had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are emerging: Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account; indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The Fifa apologises in the sense that "the signatures on the electoral forms were written in uppercase and therefore not valid".
Sudan ’ s Trainer
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election, and while the situation in Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Association states that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally judged: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three.
Nicaragua's captain, Juan Barrera, had also been accused of not voting for the # TheBest2019 Awards.
On Friday, the Association announced that it was right, but of course there was no intention: the completed electoral documents were "mistakenly" marked with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, as stated in a communication from the Association, but in fact the second captain, Manuel Rosas, was elected, "We take responsibility for the administrative error," as stated in, but both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte voted for Messi, "all the way in the official FIFA list".
The other cases are now being examined by Fifa in an investigation, but it is emphasised that the electoral process has been externally supervised by the consultancy PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world election - and Jürgen Klopp the world coach of the year.
Ukraine ’ s Affair: Senior Republicans advocate official investigation
"I think the investigation is important," says Republican Governor Vermont Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, according to Scott, "for years."
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump over the Whistleblower affair, and few have been uneasy about it. Scott ’ s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party, with the moderate governor of Virginia having repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration rules.
"It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and the responsibility for Congress is now to investigate and get to the bottom of the matter."
Scott and Baker, as Governor of US states, have no formal say in the case of Trump being decided in Congress, so their statements are mostly symbolic, but Republican senators have also been critical of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also reported that the Republicans were making initial internal fissures.
The affair could lead to the impeachment of Trump, with House Democrats announcing an investigation, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment; with a majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment, but the decision on actual impeachment would be in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have a majority, so there is little chance that such a process will succeed; so far, no US president has been impeached by an impeachment procedure. in. in, in, in, in,,,,,,,
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily and raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after having illegally managed the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board.
"We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any secure information about it," said "Sea Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
In mid-September, the police said that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured, and even murdered: Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," the communication said.

Musk Waits for Tesla ’ s Extradition Record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk gave his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures.
"We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," wrote Musk in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
Tesla is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world.
In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars, reaching its previous level.
Musk needs records in order to achieve its high goals, and in 2019 he plans to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars, with six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter of the year.
US budget dispute: Bridge-financing
The new financial year will start in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget; the Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, the United States once again has no spending plans before the new fiscal year begins on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (continuation resolution, CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have occurred on Monday at midnight, a partial shutdown of the federal administration.
Absent Shutdown
For the time being, the Federal Government is to be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019, which will end on Monday, because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities, so the Federal Government cannot, for the time being, benefit from the extended spending framework for the new financial year from $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion.
In the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, the Democrats have completed ten of the 12 laws, but the spending laws reflect Democrats ’ priorities, which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate, and the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the 12 spending plans that are barely capable of majority voting.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion to build the Wall, one of President Trump ’ s major priorities. The Democrats are bothered by the Wall building plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects.
Ghosts Break at the Wall
At the moment, it is unclear how the parties will move forward on this issue; more likely than agreement on all 12 spending laws over the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond November 21, and a shutdown is not ruled out.
In the light of the Congress ’ s persistent inability to agree on the 12 spending laws in good time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas about automating the process are gaining popularity.
France Allows Artificial Fertility for Lesbians and Singles
In France, artificial insemination will in future also be open to women and lesbians living alone: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a bill by the government that allows all women to benefit from in vitro fertilization, which should significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
In the three days of emotional debate, critics on the right warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Minister of Health, Agnès Buzyn, defended as an "opportunity" for society, portraying the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents.
Prohibition of sperm from dead husbands
By a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their dead man for artificial insemination; in Belgium, Spain, and the United Kingdom artificial insemination is permitted 'post-mortem'; in Germany, there have been cases in the past where women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased man; in Paris, opponents of the offense argued that such a certified child would carry a 'particularly serious fate'.
Many members of the governing party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had called for artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be given a "double mourning" if her husband's death left her wish to have children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the amendment that has now failed consider it unfair that in future a widow can be tainted with the semen of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
In France, artificial insemination is permitted only to heterosexual couples who cannot bear children, who must be married or live together for at least two years.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate Compensation: Calls for a flight levy for universities are rising louder.
There is a lot of flying at universities, which is why the country wants a climate tax to be imposed there too, and the rectors say that they have no money for it, but now they are under internal pressure.
The universities should also restrict themselves to flying.
The debate on a climate levy on flights from universities and universities, which was postponed before the summer recess, is getting under way again, and after the conference was skeptical, the plans will now receive support from universities.
Russia Retreats North Korean Fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the detainees have been illegally fished in Russian waters, and 10 days earlier, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested, at which time there was a change of fire between the border guards and the crew of the boat, injuring three Russians and a North Korean, who later suffered serious injuries, but this time there were no injured, it was said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, so North Korean fishermen were on the way to Russian territorial waters, where, according to their own data, Russia ’ s coastguard patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 octopus seized
During the re-inspection, 30,000 octopus were discovered and confiscated on the boats, and three fishing and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia ’ s fisheries authorities had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after appeals from local entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been detained there for a while this year, according to the media.
The head of the union of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently complained of the high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who were fishing with synthetic nets banned in Russia, which would also take small creatures out of the sea, and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be dismantled.
In the future, only 18,000: the US is lowering the asylum ceiling.
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The world ’ s richest country is closed to asylum-seekers: as Washington ’ s State Department confirms, the ceiling on the legal influx of refugees will be lowered further, with, in the future, mainly threatened believers and Iraqis being granted asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low threshold for receiving new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year that runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, the US State Department declared that the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has slashed acceptance for guardians from around the world in recent years. Under Barack Obama ’ s previous administration, far higher reception limits had been set.
The proposed ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was launched in 1980, but the State Department still called the US "the most merciless and generous nation in history," a phrase that strongly resembles the language used by the incumbent US president.
A "responsible handling" of refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild them, Trump declared.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to shut down. Trump has imposed the National Emergency to finance the construction of a border wall. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear.
According to the Foreign Office, the US government intends to focus on receiving two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and who are in danger as a result of this, as stated in the State Department statement, while Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to receive a maximum of 1 500 refugees.
The United States wants to see people from this' northern triangle 'of Central America, in particular, seeking asylum in other countries, and it is against this background that the United States concluded migration agreements with Guatemala, and now with El Salvador and Honduras, in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.

Nike Benefits from New Online Marketing Strategy
The U.S. sports goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profit despite the trade dispute with China, with net profit rising to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (just under $1.3 billion), 25 percent more than in the prior-year period, as announced by the Group on Tuesday, mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
The company ’ s sales increased to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August, with the largest increase in Nike sales in China, up 22%, and thus benefited from Beaverton ’ s approach to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People ’ s Republic.
Financial chief Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to advance the "digital transformation" of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments, thereby increasing its competitive advantage.

Conflict between Iran and the US: Rouhani talks about the end of sanctions - Trump Disagrees
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, on his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of a supposed US offer to lift sanctions. The United States, in exchange for talks with Tehran ’ s leaders, had promised to end all sanctions, said Rouhani on its official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted his Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him for a meeting.
Rouhani describes what happened: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting take place. "And America says I am raising the sanctions," Rouhani added.
But Rouhani criticized this move not in an acceptable way, and no one could predict the outcome of negotiations, given the sanctions in force and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure."
Earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York, with Europeans hoping to save the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated with Russia and China, which would prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France ’ s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Rouhani would meet US President Donald Trump on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes struck Western Turkey in a very short space of time, the fear of a disaster is growing, with 34 people injured in Tuesday ’ s earthquake, with almost 200 aftershocks since the earthquake last day, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday, raising concerns about a disaster.
On Thursday, the earthquake of 5.8 hit the Marmarese region of Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropolises, and now the government wants to a commission to better, Octa.
In the last 20 years Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
City planners such as the famous architect Múcella Yapiti have warned for years that large open spaces, which have been registered as a refuge in the centre, have long since been built.
The epicenter of Thursday ’ s earthquake was in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometres depth, as the Afad Civil Protection Agency reported.
On Twitter, the mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, announced that injured people or damage had not been reported at first, and were,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Istanbul is considered to be the most vulnerable to earthquakes, and under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian earth plates.
It is not clear when the earthquake will occur, but the western part of the country and Istanbul will again be affected by the earthquake on Thursday.
Companies are designing emergency plans, private individuals have completed their so-called 'go bags' with all necessary items next to front doors, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes.
In the summer of 2006, the city of Istanbul hosted the International Congress of the People's Republic of Turkey, the International Congress of the People's Republic of Turkey and the International Congress of the People's Republic of Turkey.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users reported panic; buildings were shaky; schools and hospitals were evacuated; telephone lines were interrupted; it was more violent than Tuesday ’ s, writes a user.
The date of the quake is officially indicated at 1.59 p.m. (local time).
On Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a serious earthquake.
Researchers assume that, sooner or later, a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high - scientists believe that it will eventually unload - and cause massive damage.
Ersoy says that the earthquake is now a warning, and that it has become more likely to be CNN Türk.
A few weeks ago, there was an incident - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul - and there was also a violent earthquake in Albania just a few days ago - there were 68 people injured, and the earth was also blown up on Lake Constance this year.

The Kakerlake: Inspired by Kafka, Ian McEwan writes the Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit mess? He writes a book about, and his protagonist is...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inspired by Franz Kafka ’ s famous “The Transformation, ” the UK ’ s successful author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The book "Die Kakerlake" (The Cockroach) will be published in German on 27 November, and will be published by Diogenes Verlag (Zurich), which deals with the transformation of a man named "Jim Sam", who was ignored or hated in his previous life but is now suddenly the most powerful man of Britain.,, and,,,,,, and,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and.,,,, and.,,, and
McEwan was quoted as saying: 'When Parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers in high positions are crying out for the disaster of a no-deal, a writer has to ask what he can do; there is only one answer: write.' McEwan only appeared in the spring of the novel 'Machines like me' on artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first novel, published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into an immense misfortune", is gradually excluded from family and society, and finally perishes. "Ian McEwan bows before Kafka to describe a world that stands head," said Diogenes Verlag.

Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until 31 October.
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all trips until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application.
The company is also involved in bookings made by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or fully paid.
Thomas Cook, in Germany, was in the midst of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed an insolvency application on Wednesday.
Insurers Will Transfer Hotels
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad that currently host Thomas-Cook holidaymakers will receive money from Zurich insurance.
On the basis of the booking information and without the presentation of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50% of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich speaker of the German Press Agency said.
The German Tourist Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres (Bundesverband der Verband der Umweltzentrale) strongly criticised this.
The first day of the event was held in Zurich.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the announcement that Zurich insurance payments to hotels will only help the traveller who is still on the way, and it looks bad for Thomas-Cook customers who still want to fly on holiday.
The company opened its doors as of November 1, 2019, in accordance with the insolvency insurance scheme, it said that the further procedure will be examined.
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. clients to the Kaand to their claims on the Kawebsite. to the.

Stocking Brexit Negotiations: The Risk of No Deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made it clear that he will not guarantee a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but what has been said about the polarizing British is perpetual. The Supreme Court ’ s recent ruling in Britain hovers like a sword of Damocles over the Blonjahr. His suspension of the parliament in order to be stubbornly able to carry out his bit ’ s course until the exit date was annulled earlier this week, and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral talks until 31 October in the event of failed negotiations with the EU.
Boris Johnson Believes Deal Still
But the pressure does not seem to pass him noticeably either, and in the meantime, when he visited a hospital, he suggested that if he did not, he would support an extension of negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal, I am cautiously optimistic that will.
And time is gradually running out of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels, with the EU and the British negotiators having some six weeks left to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But the recent talks have again failed to achieve a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October now seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not bring the law into force, the withdrawal date will be postponed again, but the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister ’ s words, fearing that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.

Fear of New Protests in Egypt Grows
The video of Mohammed Ali has been divided into online networks millions of times, calling for a "People's Revolution" by the Spanish developer and actor, calling for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, accusing critics of corruption and mismanagement.
In addition, there are also a number of police stations that have been closed, and streets around Tahrir Square have been closed.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
The human rights organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that nearly 2000 people have been arrested since last week, many of whom have been arbitrarily arrested simply because they were "at the wrong place at the wrong time", and reported that HRW has been accused of committing crimes against them.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country, according to which the government in Cairo blocks Web sites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after toppling democratically elected Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of government, bloggers, and activists have been imprisoned and partly convicted in recent years.
Ocean Change: Arved Fuchs of Greenland Expedition back
The Arctic explorer Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, said the Polarscientist, who waited years for the young generation to speak, and we have known for decades that the earth is warming, yet many acted as if there were a planet B.
He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the depletion of the seas.
"For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony.

A phone call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually face impeachment proceedings after the tumultuous revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to check this with their House inquiry as soon as possible - we are talking about weeks before a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj is supposedly the telephone call. The charge of the whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation out of concern for national security and for US democracy with his complaint, is monstrous: the president used the power of his office to orchestrate another country ’ s government for influencing the 2020 election, using Ukraine ’ s dependence to blackmail and force it to act against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be found in the now-published caption of the conversation with Selenckyj, though it does not reflect the full text. But July 25 ’ s phone call is only an episode of a much larger story, centered on Trump ’ s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
History begins from the public's point of view in May 2019, when Rudy Giuliani's New York Times reports travel plans to Ukraine; he wants to meet in Kiev with just elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We are not interfering in an election, we are interfering in an investigation into what we have the right to do," he says the newspaper, "it may be inappropriate, but" there is nothing illegal about it, "Giuliani wants to be prosecuted in Ukraine for which there is little basis -" because this information will be very helpful, very helpful for my clients and could prove helpful for my government. "
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiratorial fantasies fixated on Trump ’ s opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton has conspired with Ukrainian actors, critics said at the time to construct grounds for the US investigation into Russia, but that charge was never serious.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk about so prominently on the phone in July with Selenskyj. The version of Giulianis and the president is that the former vice president and currently promising candidate for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as Obama ’ s Ukrainian envoy, urged the dismissal of the then Ukrainian public prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, to stop the gas company ’ s investigation, in which his son, Hunter Biden, worked on his board, to blackmail Ukraine financially to cover up his family ’ s corrupt machinations.
Indeed, when Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian Attorney-General to go, the investigation of the gas company had already been completed, and Hunter Biden was never directly affected, and Shokin was also accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the US government was far from being the only Western partner to press for his release, and the Obama administration even explicitly investigations.

Four Dead Elephants in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday, 'We suspect were poisoned'.
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous Sigiriya rock fortress, visited by many tourists.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year, and the perpetrators are often farmers whose land the animals had previously been harmed, while around 50 elephants are killed each year, most of them when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
Sri Lanka is estimated to have only about 7,000 elephants, and their killing is theoretically punishable by death.

Does Britain ’ s government want to circumvent Brexit law?
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been obsessed about whether he is seeking ways to circumvent the law against an unregulated Brexit recently enacted by Parliament, and, on a Friday ’ s question, merely told journalists that his government would abide by the law.
The Act requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal deadline if no agreement with the EU was reached by mid-October, Johnson criticizing it as a "surrender law" that made negotiations with the EU more difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, and Johnson could use a trial trick to postpone the law's entry into force until after the EU leaves.
Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union. 'We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October and the best way forward is by agreement'.
Iran appears to be hovering on uranium enrichment
Iran's president, Hassan Rowhani, has increased pressure on Europe's partners in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states show incompetence or unwillingness to take concrete action," said Rowhani at a press conference on Thursday at the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York.
The US withdrew from the deal in 2018 to force Iran to change course in what is considered to be an aggressive Middle East policy, with President Donald Trump ’ s administration seeking to negotiate a new deal with tougher conditions, and has now returned to tough sanctions against Tehran with a resumption of the treaty ’ s limited uranium enrichment.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used, or at least prepared for use, the uranium centrifuges installed at the beginning of September, and, according to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps Europeans are not prepared to bear their share of the deal, and so left the Iranians alone with the costs and burdens of stifling US sanctions, alleged Rowhani, but there will still be further talks that we hope will resolve.
Rowhani continues to deny Iran ’ s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
But the conflagration changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France, and the United Kingdom followed Monday ’ s US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Initially, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had committed to the attack, which the US viewed as a false commitment.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence," said Rowhani, but European leaders would not have been able to do so in talks with him during the UN General Debate; instead, they would simply have called for the rebels in Yemen not to launch an attack like this. Rowhanhad in in with Chancellor in in with with. in, in. in, in,
Before talking to US President Trump, Rouhani called for the US administration to reverse its far-reaching sanctions, calling for a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet of Another Star Cruises Solar System
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space, which was first successful, and the comet allows conclusions about other solar systems.
What was initially only an assumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system.
The farthest comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea with a self-built telescope of 65 cm diameter.
2I / Borisov, after 1I / 'Oumuamua of 2017, is only the second interstellar object that was spotted during a flight through our solar system.
"The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is far above the typical speeds of objects circling the sun," said Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa in a communication.
According to the analysis, the comet is on the way to a so-called hyperbolic orbit that takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I / 'Oumuamua 2I / Borisov has already been spotted, leaving many months for researchers to investigate.
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor, including a team around Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already guided the characterization of 1I / 'Oumuamua, in a first investigation, determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers of the Canary Islands astrophysical institute (IAC) have already obtained a first spectrum of interstellar welders that provides a kind of fingerprint of their chemical composition.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to research certain processes in other solar systems.
According to Esa-Science Director Günther Hasinger, the agency wants to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth.
Beijing ’ s New Mega-Airport Daxing First Landing
Just in time for the 70th anniversary of the People ’ s Republic, the time has come: at the new Mega Airport in the south of China ’ s capital, a first passenger aircraft from China United Airlines landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project.
The complex has four runways to be extended to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system.
During the construction process, the Chinese had already announced on several occasions that Berlin could learn from Beijing.
New supersonic aircraft is expected to fly from London to Sydney in four and a half hours ’ time.
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - this is the dream of the UK Space Agency, a special supersonic engine (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) developed by the US company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the CNN quoted the agency.
In the early 1990s, Concorde was the first airline to fly to New York City, and the first airline to fly to Australia.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transportation," writes Reaction Engines on its homepage, among other things.
Wanting in Washington: Trump wants to find anonymous tippers in the Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of US President power, Donald Trump wants to find possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave Whistleblower the information," Trump said Thursday to staff of the United Nations Mission in New York. the person concerned was almost "a spy," and they have "a bit different" in the past than they are today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate whistleblowers, but several US media reported on Friday ’ s speech, and Democrats reacted outrageously to the president ’ s statement.
On Tuesday, US House Democrats announced preparations for an impeachment trial against Trump, based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence worker making serious charges against Trump and his headquarters. on public pressure the statement on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants information from several government officials that the US president "uses the power of his office" to get another country to interfere in the US election in his favor in 2020.
At the center of the charges is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukraine ’ s President Volodymyr Selenskyy in late July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that might harm his political rival, Joe Biden, about former deals by Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his spin-off from Ukrainian justice. Biden is ahead of the race for the Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to Ukraine ’ s telephone call: senior government officials have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling.
The New York Times reported that it should be a member of the CIA.
On Friday, Trump again questioned the credibility of the source; in a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the “whistleblower ” has distributed second-hand information that would have proved to be inaccurate, so there may be no typing or spies at all.
As Trump said in New York about the information that the whistleblower was supposed to have received, he ignited outrage. US House Chairman Nancy Pelosi was alarmed and lamented that Trump ’ s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations have been underway against Trump and his environment for months in various committees, and, in the face of Ukraine ’ s charges, the Democrats are now launching an investigation with renewed vigour to initiate a possible impeachment of Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a road map for our investigation," said the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff.
More than 300 former US security and foreign policy officials, most of whom were democratic but also Republican presidents, backed the Democratic inquiry launched on Friday for a possible impeachment. If the allegations were true, Trump said it would be "an unscrupulous abuse of power."
With a majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could pursue an impeachment process, but the decision to actually impeach him would be taken in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans hold the majority, so there is little chance that such a process will succeed.
Works Council: Jobs are being 'silenced'.
The Volkswagen brand ’ s plans to reduce production costs further could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe, a concern that drives the works council of the car manufacturer to reduce its annual factory costs of EUR 10 billion by EUR 2 billion by 2023, of which EUR 500 million is to be saved this year.
The "Future Pact", which was negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016, already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from business board circles, jobs in production that are not actually available are being "stealthed" through a different route - that is, bypassing the official course, often leaving vacant regular jobs unfilled.
In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing the re-establishment of the company; meanwhile, many jobs are lacking, the work compression is increasing, the worries about the gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants are increasing, so there is also a growing fear that vehicle production might gradually be diverted from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world.
The Volkswagen brand aims to further standardize production worldwide and centrally control new projects.
For example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year.
20 hours.
For Wolfsburg, the parent company Wolfsburg is the only factory in which vehicles are produced.
As Tostmann, the head of production, announced last year, in Wolfsburg, a million cars will be rolling from the band in terms of prospects.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg, but sales of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined, so expectations are now resting on the Golf 8.
Forced to Prostitute by Voodoo
Young women from Nigeria have been gagged, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six alleged traffickers have been imprisoned for doing so.
On Friday in Bochum, six alleged human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to custodial and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months.
The victims were between the ages of 17 and 22, and were brought to slumber boats across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers, but the dream of a better future was not fulfilled.
The defendants - four men and two women - admitted the infiltration and subsequent distribution of young Nigerians on brothels in the trial.
The sentences refer to commercial and band-based infiltration of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo Calls for Negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm Permanent Dispute with the Lufthansa Group has once again threatened the cabin crew union Ufo with strikes.
Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to engage in collective bargaining with the UFO for months, including whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
"I think it is unlikely that a second court will see the matter in a completely different light," said UFO CEO Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application to the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court to have the Ufo trade union status reviewed by the court, arguing that the union had for months no and was unable to its role as a collective partner.
The UFO had already begun a preliminary vote on strikes by cabin crew at Eurowing at the end of July due to doubts about its leadership.
Easier Immigration: Saudi Arabia announces a new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is now to change, and the country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa requirements.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the President of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
This article is a stub relating to realworld information.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones hit two of the country ’ s most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country ’ s largest Abkaik oil refinery and the Churai oil field, with national oil production plummeting, oil price shocks soaring, and it is likely to take several weeks to restore the Kingdom ’ s oil production to its old level.

Half of Europe ’ s species are threatened with extinction.
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging, and urban growth are the causes of the threat, reported the World Natural Protection Union IUCN on Friday in Brussels, which examined the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe, 265 of which are not present on any other continent, of which 58% are threatened, and 66 would already be at the highest level of threat and therefore of extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from 'potentially endangered' to 'endangered', 'highly endangered', 'endangered', 'endangered' and 'extinct' to 'extinct'.
Eberesche and Wild Rossabarie
According to one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency, Eberechian (Sorbus) is particularly threatened in Germany.
IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnut trees (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe on less than 10,000 copies.
Straubarate and Moose
The IUCN scientists also created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrubs are under threat, as the IUCN says, mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, species trapped, agricultural practices and climate change.
'This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet, 'said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau.' We must limit the impact of human beings on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority '.
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured
34 people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey and, according to the figures, there were no deaths; dozens of people had to leave their homes; 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for safety reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.

Cook Fail: Hotels Get Money from Insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to pay dearly for the tour operator Thomas Cook ’ s default, with high write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans, including Credit Suisse, writes the Financial Times in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse would probably have to carry out write-downs totaling up to £1.8 billion (about €2 billion) on their books, as the report suggests.
The bonds ’ creditors would have to accept write-downs of £900 million to £1 billion and lenders from £550 to £825 million, while the actual write-offs would be more likely to be at the top of the bandwidths, one expert told the story.

The United States Warning Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the federal government against trusting Huawei, China ’ s network equipment supplier.
We believe that the risks are too great, "said Pai to the" Handelsblatt "with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" requiring any company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to comply with instructions from the security agencies.
Current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, "said the FCC CEO, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of trustworthiness" from suppliers.
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "Handelsblatt" reports on the basis of its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible.
It is the software that is important to keep the devices up to date, a software that consists of billions,,,,, etc.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," said the FCC CEO.
He accuses the Chinese Huawei of close contact with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque; the company that supposedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government, "Pai told the" Handelsblatt ".
The US would find that government officials were placed within the company, and Pai recently advocated talks in Berlin to promote the US position.
Chemical factory in northern France: closed schools
During the night, local residents hear explosions, and a gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky over a North French chemical factory.
After a fire at a chemical factory in the town of Rouen in northern France on Thursday, schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
The Ministry of the Interior had asked citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not be exposed to smoke, and farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop harvesting for the time being.
According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 policemen and gendarmes were deployed at the fire station.
French media reported huge flames and explosions at the Lubrizol plant, which produces oil additives, which is located a few kilometres from the city centre.
The Normandy factory, according to the authorities, belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites that are particularly monitored.
The city is located in the north of France, on the banks of the river Seine.
Rouen is a regional metropolis on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: 'Germany Must Invest Now'
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany needs to invest, and the sooner the better, "Le Maire said on Thursday evening when he presented the French budget for next year.
The eurozone economy was weaker, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to take the necessary decisions'.
Action should be taken by those states that have budgetary room for more investment, Le Maire said with a view, among other things, to Germany.
France did not have these margins, added the minister, and pointed to its country's high public debt, which is more than 98% of GDP.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy, while German politicians have repeatedly called on France to manage its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government is responding, among other things, to the protests of the Gelbwesten movement, with new debt expected to fall to 2.2% this year, according to 3.1.
Is he trying to trickle down? Johnson evades the question of Brexit tactics.
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "capitulation law" passed by Parliament.
The House is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a Chaos Rexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson might use another loophole, but the Tory politician evades this possibility.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been obsessed with pushing for an unregulated Brexit – despite the law recently passed by parliament, which is precisely to prevent it. On a question, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by the law.
The Act requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal deadline if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October, Johnson criticizing it as a "capitulation law" that made negotiations with the EU more difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested that Johnson could try to use 'political harassment' to circumvent the law, and that the prime minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the law's entry into force until after the EU's exit. Johnson said that he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. 'We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October and the best way forward is with an agreement'.
Johnson ’ s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has said that he feels the political battles over Brexit as a “walk in the park, ” and has been confident that the EU ’ s exit will come:“ We enjoy it, we will win, we will leave (Note.
Cummings, who led the “Vote Leave ” campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now the chief strategist in Downing Street, the UK ’ s headquarters, behind the hard-line policy that has put the prime minister in an almost hopeless situation.

'We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran '
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from neighbouring countries, despite US sanctions imposed on Iran, and Turkish President Recep TayErdogan said in interview published on Friday that Turkey could not oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy natural gas from there, "Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "withdrawn because of US threats".
Nevertheless, "especially on this issue and on many other issues, Turkey will continue our relations with Iran," said the Turkish President, who has repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran ’ s oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf have intensified considerably in recent months.
The US government ’ s Retention of Refugees
The US government wants to slash the admission of refugees, with the US State Department declaring on Thursday that the annual ceiling for a resettlement program should be lowered from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees now, a cut of 40%.
The State Department declared that, while the US remains committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on receiving two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and who are in danger as a result of this, as stated in the State Department's statement, while Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to receive a maximum of 1 500 refugees.
The 1980 program will select refugees from UN camps around the world and resettle them in the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program ’ s history. Already, the current ceiling of 30,000 is low. When US President Donald Trump ’ s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was close to 85,000.
"This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, who would further damage its leadership role in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to limit immigration to the US – both legally and illegally – with the US government claiming that 350,000 applications for asylum will be received for the coming budget year, which is separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Come Close to a Spider"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage in the Whistleblower affair. Whoever has given the whistleblowers the whistleblowers to the whistleblower who reproaches him for abusing power, "comes close to a spike," said Trump, according to a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday, which several US media reported in agreement.
So, when asked about the person who informed Whistleblower about controversial White House operations, Trump replied, "This comes close to a spike," then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were clever?
The Democrats sharply criticized Trump ’ s statements, accusing him of intimidating witnesses, and attempting to obstruct a Congressional inquiry into a possible impeachment of him, wrote House Chairmen of the Foreign, Intelligence, and Supervision Committees.
The Whistleblower accuses the president of abusing his office to seek another country ’ s interference in the 2020 US election, including his controversial telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyy in the summer. In the conversation, Trump suggested that he investigate his potential democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, in Ukraine.
As the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower is an analyst of the CIA.
Skilled Refugee Boat: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean.
Over and over again, people are trying to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece, where the boats, often too small, are regularly capsized, and seven migrants – including five children – have died as a result of the sinking of a tubing boat.
According to the Greek coast guard, four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.

Leasing Suddenly: WeWork Treats Real Estate Markets
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork has grown from a small startup to a driving force in the world ’ s most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis, with landlords fearing billions in revenue.
WeWork ’ s crisis threatens to upset the balance in the world ’ s largest real estate markets, with a few days ago, when founder Adam Neumann resigned as head of the company, postponed the planned listing, and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as private jet for executives to gain financial room for the coming weeks and months.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it to members in some small units, such as freelancers, small startups, or entire departments of large corporations.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded rental contracts of up to 15 years, with commitments of more than $40 billion, which could pose a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire property markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the world ’ s most expensive real estate markets, has rented nearly 300,000 square meters of office space over the past 24 months. WeWorks ’ new contracts alone have ensured that demand for offices in New York was larger than the space that was in.
In the UK ’ s capital, too, the balance in the housing market could shift significantly without further expansion of aggressive startups, including the prime tenant, WeWork, in an office house bought last year by the Sparkassen fund provider Deka for nearly €100 million at the heart of the financial metropolis.
If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would have to write off some of the billions of dollars in revenues they had hoped for.
Russia once again captured many North Korean fishermen
The Russian coastguard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen, and a total of 262 poachers who have fished illegally in the waters have been arrested in recent days, according to the Interfax agency, according to the Russian Federal Intelligence Service, on Friday.
Just ten days ago, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested, and before that the border guards had been fired and three of them injured.
North Korean fishermen were thus on their way to Russian territorial waters, where, according to their own data, Russia ’ s coastguard patrols to protect their marine biological resources; 30,000 squirrels were discovered during the re-inspection; three fishing boats and two motorboats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok; according to Ria Nowosti, the Coast Guard identified more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
The Russian Fisheries Agency did not issue fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korean fishermen were already temporarily arrested there in 2019, according to the media.
The head of the union of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently complained of the high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who used synthetic nets, which were banned in Russia, which would take small living creatures out of the sea, and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea where they needed 200 years to be dismantled, and the ships themselves would not comply with hygienic and technical rules.
According to Moscow, three members of Russia ’ s coastguard had been injured during the arrests last week, and one equally wounded North Korean died later, according to the FSB, of his injuries. On September, 17, Russian border guards first a vessel, and a second, after the opened.
The US imposes an entry ban on former President Castro
The United States has imposed visa bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, and the US State Department, in a communication on Thursday, justified this with Castro's participation in 'gross human rights violations'.
"The Cuban regime's disregard for human rights and use of force to prop up the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," tweeted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump, among others, banned entry on Wednesday against members of the Venezuelan government and the military.

New Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands and thousands of people are now again trying to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world, starting with the shift in the time of New Zealand and Australia before the protests across Europe to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Canadian Montreal, as well as in the White House in Washington.
"Last Friday, more than four million people attacked for the climate," she wrote on Twitter.
This time, according to a list of the movements, demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
In August 2018, at the age of 15, Thunberg stood before the Swedish parliament to call on her country ’ s politicians to make a greater effort to protect the climate, and the Fridays-for-Future movement soon emerged.
Together, they demand more ambition from policymakers in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate disaster. Above all, under the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be contained to below 1.5 degrees relative to pre-industrial times.
On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the world ’ s leaders in Stockholm, where she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize at the Right Livelihood Foundation for her commitment to climate protection.
Russia forbids Smoking on the Balcony
The people of Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony, which provides for a change in fire protection.
If you want to smoke, you can expect a fine of 3.000 rubles (42.46 euros).
Shoot against Cybercriminals - Investigators Lifting Servers
In the fight against cybercrime, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
A total of 13 culprits are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as the operator of a data centre in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, via which internationally operating criminals operated their activities.
This was announced by the Attorney General in Koblenz, and seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening at a major action.
According to the Attorney General, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the cyberbunker.
It was said that such a hoster had been outsourced in Germany for the first time.
During the access campaign with the support of special units such as the GGG9, searches were conducted in Germany and in neighbouring countries, resulting from nearly five years of investigation, and at lunchtime the investigators wanted to provide further details.

Climate protests  Who are actually Thunberg's backmen?
In the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that are warming the climate, justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st.
It is not historically the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to attract a crowd of children and young people.
In addition, Greta Thunberg has also published a book that has sold extensively, thanks to a daughter in the spotlight.
It is also true that certain groups of people are working together with stock-market brokers during the rescue operation.
Comet discovers: Interstellar Guest Crossed by our Solar System
A foreign comet currently crosses our solar system.
Astronomers ’ suspicions have been confirmed: a foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment.
2I / Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea.
The body in question was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea, who looked into the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion.
The great opportunity for astronomers is to get a close insight into a strange solar system.
Comet was spotted before flight - and can be observed for several months.
"The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and will be seen by mid-sized telescopes by April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
Initial findings on Komet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science.
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter, and at the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of welding is similar to ours.
The observation goes beyond individual knowledge, however.
A giant asteroid recently crossed the Earth and came perilously close to it.
'Absolutely reprehensible ': Rachel Johnson appalled at Brother
His brother leaves the cabinet, and now, in clear terms, his sister castigates the prime minister ’ s belligerent language as “distasteful. ” It is not the brother she knows.
'capitulation ',' fraud ',' treaty ': Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly equipping - at least verbally - with massive opposition outrage at Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, and more critics have now spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister, Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, longed, divided, divided, divided, divided, divided, and riveted," which they consider to be most reprehensible. She did no,, Rachel Johnson said, who in the elections for the party. were,, and,, and,, and.
In particular, she came up with the reference by her brother, Jo Cox, to an EU-friendly lower house member murdered by a neo-Nazi just a few days before the 2016 Leave referendum, whose memory can best be honoured by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the lower house. "It is very distasteful to refer to a member of parliament murdered by someone who called" Britain first, "criticizing Johnson's sister, who apparently came from the far-right camp that felt" supported by this kind of language. "
"It makes me sick if Jos's name is used in this way," he tweeted.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson ’ s younger brother, Jo, resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory MP. "I was torn between loyalty to the family and the national interest in recent months - it is an unsolvable tension," explained Jo Johnson.
As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England are critical of the language 'unworthy of this country', and in a joint statement they said: 'In recent days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable; we should speak with respect'.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear on the Super Bowl.
In the year of its 100-year existence, the NFL is sending out a strong signal: In the midtime show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latin roots are appearing, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latena Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the midtime show at the upcoming finale of the U.S. Football League NFL, announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honoured and humiliated to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, which has an incredible strength in the USA," said Shakira in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will be celebrating its 100th anniversary next year, will take place in Miami on February 2.
"I love the Super Bowl this time bringing two women on stage - and two Latinas," Lopez said, sending an important message to all Americans and the world, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico, in the 2000s she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish.
Shakira was known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer.
The announcement of mid-term guests is eagerly awaited in the US every time, and this year, many see the selection as a political gesture, given that the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump ’ s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sporting event and a gigantic advertising spectacle, with musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones as a rule watching more than 100 million viewers at the NFL final, which is also very popular in Germany.
In the early 1990s, the band began to perform in the United States, where they played in the United States.
An actor and Youtube attributes Egypt ’ s ruler: for the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have an influence over whether blood will flow on Egypt ’ s streets have both been abroad last week, and one of them was back at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 removed the Muslim Brotherhood Mohammed Morsi, the country ’ s first freely elected leader, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi ’ s actions against political Islam and not lost a syllable about human rights violations on the Nile – a week in which Egypt ’ s security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president.
Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, evading the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil.
He goes to the head of state directly and in a very rustic language; while the people are hungry, the president is hovering in luxury and are building magnificent new palaces, he says; the army, on Sisi, accusof corruption and enrichment;, because in in as,,,,,, and, and.
After the first thousands of demonstrators against his rule last week since Sisi's grip on power, and almost 2000 citizens, including prominent figures in civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "Million March" this Friday.
On Friday, a massive police presence was reported from the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators demolished banners with the presidential portrait last week; security checkin the city and; in Cairo several subway stations were closed for "maintenance"; most around Tahr,, the heart in; in in; in in; in in,,,, and;,,,,,,,,,,,,,; and,;,,,,;,,,,,,,,,,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and..,,

When Provider Promises Too Much Performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities.
If you sign an Internet contract, you do not need to trust the speed data of the providers blindly; customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved if there is something to show.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, says the Consumer Centre of Bavaria.
If the connection always appears to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different ways of checking, for example, the measuring tools of the Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to the supplier specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively", says the Consumer Centre of Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days for the supplier to produce the promised service.
If this does not apply even after several requests, customers may cancel and may also claim damages.
Republican First Ranking for Investigation
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it goes from here is determined by the facts that will be found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action - an impeachment can lead to the removal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy in a phone call to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, for Trump has been watching Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far withstood criticism of Trump over the Whistleblower affair, with few showing unease. Scott ’ s statements are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already opposed Trump ’ s policies on several occasions, such as the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration rules.
Spider-Man Stay in the MCU: More Marvel Film
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August, it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future, so Tom Hollands Spider-Man would no longer be part of the Avengers universe.
The movie was released in the United States on July 16, 2021.
"Screenhant" magazine quotes Marvel Boos Kevin Feige: "I am pleased that Spidey's way is being continued in the MCU.
The company is also the only company in the United States to offer a wide range of products and services.
Herzogin Meghan and Prince Harry are appearing in the Suits Finale.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has reached the big final in the United States, with many happy endings and just as many cameo appearances, as well as the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who has been involved in the series for many years, receiving a charming tribute.

Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accidents
A baby and four other children drowned while capping a refugee boat in the Aegean, and seven people died as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland, saving four children, three women and five men.
At the moment, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, where, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed last year.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wanted to find out in Turkey 'what the situation is like about the refugee situation', said Seehofer on Friday, and then in Athens he wanted to learn more about the 'administrative problems of the Greeks' in order to help them cope.
On Friday, a spokeswoman of the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip by Seehofer with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avaramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an extraordinary number of migrants continue to arrive from Turkey, and on Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, as the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increased figures recently cast doubt on the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016, which allows the EU to send back all refugees and migrants who illegally enter the Greek islands via Turkey, in exchange for receiving a Syrian refugee from Turkey for any deported Syrians.
Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, have a population of almost 29 400, the worst of which is the situation in Lesbos: there are currently 5200 migrations in a 650 population camp.
Never since the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact entered into force in March 2016 have there been so many, the state radio reported.
Climate Change: heat leads to more heart attacks.
According to medical experts, climate change will test the health system in the future, and climate change is "quite certain" one of the biggest challenges facing the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeier, President of the German Society for Cardiology.
Green politician Must Response for Painful Photo Pane
The Canadian Green leader, Elizabeth May, campaigned - was rigged for that reason?
The Canadian Grünen boss holds a reusable hand in a photo, but now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - It has not been noticed for quite a long time - and has finally come to light.
Green bosses must answer for photo pans
The National Post then accused May of manipulation, and that the Party produces fake news in order to be more credible on the issue of environmental protection, in the midst of an election campaign for the House of Commons, in which Trudeau has become increasingly difficult because of a corruption scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and raised the discussion about fake news.
May was shocked, and said on her blog that she didn ’ t know anything about this action, but to, she the,,,,,,,,, and., and,,,,,,,,, and,,,,,,,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian, and at the same time asks herself of her over-committed team: "If they want to work on an image again, could they not do something with my face, so I look younger?"
Even the German Greens have been advised because of their use of disposable plastic or air travel in Shitstorms - but their pictures were not spotted.
Influencecerin wants to upgrade free of charge: a life-long flight ban at Cathay..
Jaqueline Ng was reportedly promised an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly again with Cathay Pacific.
Once you are upgraded to Business Class, many passengers dream of it, sometimes they are lucky, and the check-in staff offer a free Economy Class change.
This case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influenza cerin has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade.
Jaqueline ’ s staff refused to upgrade on their way to the airport, despite the fact that they had sent a mail telling them that they were planning an upgrade to Cathay Pacific.
This time Jaqueline was reported to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number.
The airline staff at the airport cancels Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific.
In her case, the Influencercerin turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket back.
Jaqueline ’ s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight, which Jaqueline does not want to settle for - and is now hiring a lawyer.
Oil Prices After Report on Armistice in Yemen
The U.S. dollar is the highest in the world, and the U.S. dollar is the lowest in the world.
The coup was triggered by a Wall Street Journal report on a cease-fire in Yemen, with Saudi Arabia reportedly agreeing to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil facilities had halted five per cent of global oil production. The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had claimed the attacks; Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran; a ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region.
If an agreement is reached, it can focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Commodity Strategy Department at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices are continuing its downward trend in recent days, with a barrel of WTI oil costing almost $59 a week ago, Brent costing almost $65.
Most recently, according to Insider, Bloomberg reported that oil repair work in Saudi Arabia was progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September, so that production had returned to a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back to the original quantity.
Most recently, there have been press releases calling on insiders to report rapid progress in repair work by the Saudi Aramco state-owned oil company, but raw materials experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is planning a stock exchange and is trying to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some sense of relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker 'Stena Impero' is on the way to leaving the port more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recent release of the vessel, which is now preparing the departure while the ship is still on the dock, the shipping arm Erik Hånell informed Swedish radio on Friday morning in an SMS message.
But the US announced that it would move defense missiles and soldiers to Iran ’ s arch-enemy, Saudi Arabia. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom at times pushed up oil prices sharply in recent weeks.
Recriminating Trump
In the case of US President Donald Trump ’ s possible abuse of power, allegations of cover-up have been made against the White House. Several senior officials would have worked hard to prevent access to the talk ’ s text after a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenkkyy at the end of July, as an anonymous whistleblower explained.
North Korea ’ s Third Trump and Kim Summits
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon take place on the nuclear issue. The sense and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of a lack of progress in implementing first-summit agreements in Singapore, said senior diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA agency.
The US has not yet done anything to implement last year ’ s summit decisions, said the North Korean Foreign Ministry ’ s adviser, and has criticized tougher US sanctions and joint military exercises by the US and South Korea, but he hopes for a “wise ” and“ bold ” decision by Trump to bring the rapprochement back.
On Monday, Trump said that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he declared himself ready. Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second Trump and Kim summit in Hanoi in February, and both met in June in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states, agreeing to revive the talks, but with little success.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers are to help mine clearance.
The British Prince Harry, dressed with a blue splinter vest, symbolically lit and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola, near a camp of the British Halo Trust at Dirico, the detonator exploded at a safe distance, and later, with a view to getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he called for TV cameras to be launched: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons but which have not helped to clear the way".
Pound Under Pressure - Reduction in Interest
British Pound under Pressure
With interest rates cut soon, the pound will lose value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculated that the Bank of England (BoE) would soon cut interest rates on the pound sterling.
The sales triggered statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who called for a cut in interest rates even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, because uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future, a statement that is surprising, given that Saunders is regarded as a champion of restrictive monetary policy, as Brokerhaus ActiveTrades analyst Ricardo Evangelista said.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy caused by the Brexit hack, without sending a direct signal of a cut in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take his country out of the EU by 31 October, even without a divorce agreement.
Moreover, with his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but he could pay off, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian Manipulation
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, the former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and the current Chief of Integrity of the World Athletics Association.
In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed, and the Wada had banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this period, Russian athletes were not banned from the world stage altogether. The International Olympic Committee, after an individual test at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, had some 270 athletes of the country compete under a neutral flag, while at the Winter Games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were on the start, and they were in in the World Cup, in Russia in in. in, in,,,, and.,,,,,,, and,,,,,
Positive findings are missing.
In the following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the specimens in question.
"Yes, we received the data nine months ago and we should check that the task force has received the correct data," said David Howman in Friday's "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" interview.
Not affected by the World Cup
This is confirmed by the position of the IAAF: The athletics association is the only organisation to hold the flag of Russia, with 30 Russian athletes flying a neutral flag at the World Cup in Doha, having to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already thrown up manipulations and asked Russia to respond within three weeks to the accusations, and Russia is now threatening to freeze the Rusada again and, in the worst case, to exclude the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
