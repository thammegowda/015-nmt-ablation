Treysa faces vandalism and treason .	-5.8558
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired .	-6.1562
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are being sought , but solutions are hardly emerging .	-3.1414
Scherben , Zigarettenkippen , Müll und Unrat , demolierte Mülleimer und mittlerweile demontierte Hinweisschilder - so präsentiert sich seit Längerem der Einstieg mit Sitzgruppe zum Radweg auf dem Haaße-Hügel in Treysa .	-2.8758
For the foreground project Bahnradweg in Rotkäppchenland a more than impersonal sight .	-6.3831
The topic is occupied by members of the ADFC district group Schwalmstadt , but others have been working for a long time , according to the Radverkehrsbeauftragte of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen .	-7.5298
The problem has already been raised in the Committee on Transport and Tourism .	-3.3063
There has been no solution .	-5.2597
The proposals range from the transfer of the group of seats to the regular discharge of waste containers and the cleaning of the areas at the entry point .	-6.2509
" I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities " , says Wüstenhagen .	-4.1757
Guido Hahn ( ADFC ) reports that the topic has also been included in the local council .	-6.8298
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrations at weekends .	-4.8205
Not only is this often the case , but also the gels are destroyed : posts are ripped out of the earth , dustbin demolished , shields are crossed , seat furniture is crushed .	-10.4933
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often , told ADFC member Susanne Klippert .	-3.7293
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean .	-2.9990
You are annoyed that the Rastplatz on the cycle path is a meeting place for sauna storage .	-7.3547
" Along the entire cycle path there is a clear focus on the Haaße hill , " the Radverkehrsbeauftragte confirms , who now also cares about the new Radstätte in Ziegenhain , which is now open .	-13.3976
" It makes the same fate easier , it becomes quite expensive " .	-5.6456
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill : " Perhaps the threshold is significantly higher to attack the common good .	-5.7825
That would require , however , that a police strike be carried out promptly .	-5.2634
In principle , Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill .	-6.8243
It must be made more attractive .	-1.3500
After all , the frequency of the cycle path is very satisfactory .	-7.5023
The touristic marketing is still possible .	-4.5134
Our cycling path is very high quality compared to others in Germany , according to the ADFC members .	-5.0826
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa to be extremely critical .	-3.7882
There is no abbey trail on the Haaße hill .	-4.3473
In the case of heavy traffic , cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of the road , " she explains .	-5.2551
This is not a problem for sporty drivers , but for the elderly and especially for children .	-4.1359

An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann .	-2.9529
Another musician can record a song : Ihmig with his help drummer , who impressed Franke especially with his musicality , and the " Lummerland-Rudel " : " a very beautiful performance " with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon , Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle .	-5.0985
Like everyone , the children went on to the final again - and even sounded ' right ' without electronic support , as Franke said .	-7.5666
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality , reference to Hiltrup , intimacy of the melody and recognition value .	-4.7319
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music , Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven , Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive .	-3.9662
The city ’ s participation offensive was the occasion of its ten-year existence .	-7.0204
They valued the event as a full success .	-3.4101
All are " very satisfied " and " the atmosphere was good " in the soon very full cultural station .	-3.3257
The word game : " Decrypto " in the game .	-2.9190
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other .	-3.3489
For each page there is a screen , in it four cards with keywords that can only be deciphered - the old trick with the red slide - if you have inserted them .	-6.5453
This ensures that the other side can read nothing by mistake .	-5.2473
On the cards , for example , you can read from left to right : " 1 Renaissance .	-4.4094
2 . Window .	-1.0720
3 .	-1.4125
4 . Fest ' .	-1.4087
These are the terms that need to be encrypted continuously .	-5.2893
It is not the terms that should be guessed , but the codes .	-5.1732
A player per team is the encryption .	-3.9843
He gets a code card which may be " 3.4.2 " .	-4.1967
In " Decrypto " it is not the terms behind the secret film , but their encryption codes .	-5.4371
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms " cubes " , " feast " and " windows " - in such a way that his own team will recognize the correct order and the opposing team as not possible ; because that wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code .	-7.2564
In other words , the encryption notifies and reads loudly : " Werfen " for the cube , " Lose " as opposed to feast ; here , of course , something like " party " would be possible and " Prague " because he was in school and knows the window engraving there .	-8.1254
This is the way round for round , team for team .	-4.9058
You don 't know the terms of the other side - but you can get a better understanding of them with any reference that the encoder gives there .	-8.3433
It may be mysterious , but not turned off , so the enrolments should be , otherwise it is unnecessarily difficult to make his team .	-7.8664
The most cryptic to " Decrypto " is unfortunately the rule book .	-4.0066
The players must probably study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play .	-5.6991
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the net makes it easier .	-2.7053
But once you get rid of it , you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game .	-11.0905
Overall , however , " Decrypto " is not as conclusive as predecessors and Genre Primus " codenames " , which is also an agent science to play less words , but much better to play in small groups .	-6.5503
And who is only about rats and not winning points , who can easily find a version for two .	-5.6871
Kulmbach : Mann shows police Hitler 's castle and harassed guests in the pub .	-3.8243
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspectorate twice on Sunday night .	-4.7042
It was only in the Upper City that he showed the Hitlergruß in a police battle passing by , and later in the Upper City he also fell in a pub when he harassed other guests .	-9.5575
After he was clearly alcoholised by the police , he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell .	-6.9449
In a sober state , he must also be criminally responsible for the use of labels of unconstitutional organisations .	-5.6144
Pressig factory was home to Schublok 's factory .	-7.7409
The railway company in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades .	-4.1720

" When buffers were knocking on buffers , they heard it in Pressig , " remembers Georg Dinkel , who archived the history of the place and the station .	-6.5461
That did not inspire anyone .	-3.3831
As quietetes also hit the brakes and squattered the wagons .	-6.4229
That was pure rail .	-3.2972
Statements that make sense for Dinkels ’ home Pressig .	-4.4458
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway .	-3.5775
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-Bergstrecke to the north , which after an increase of about 220 meters has its peak in Steinbach am Wald .	-6.2032
In order to cope with this , train and Schubloks were needed , who had their home in Pressig .	-6.3120
In 1901 , the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station with 21 locomotives , apprenticeship workshop , steering and railway factory .	-5.9637
" At the heart was the turntable , which had a diameter of 18 meters after a rebuilding in 1899 , " says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid , railway historians and 47 years of professional railway companies .	-5.8930
Pressig ( BW ) Pressig , which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968 , also operated locomotives for the side routes Pressig - Tettau , Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten , Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben .	-6.3594
On 15 July 1950 , the " Volksblatt " reported about a staff stock of 160 men ; 13 steam and eight elliocs were stationed in Pressig .	-5.0783
Electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for train and Schubloks .	-4.3463
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains .	-3.3556
By 1991 , at least 10 000 walls were still in place .	-5.1682
In 1982 , parts of the plant were broken down in 1991 .	-4.2967
Heidrich : " It is regrettable that we did not envisage better use of the site , including in terms of freight transport " .	-4.7620
At Pfingsten 1989 , the Nuremberg Railway Director celebrated a pompous Bahnhofsfest in Pressig on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the electrification of Nuremberg - Saalfeld .	-5.8816
" There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here , " remembers Georg Dinkel .	-2.9024
Little later , the end .	-4.2401
On June 1 , 1991 , the last 30 men were withdrawn , the Pressig Rangier Station was history .	-6.0674
" The ranking and inhibitor learned the most difficult work in train traffic , " Dinkel recalls .	-5.0313
Any failure would have had fatal consequences .	-2.5476

With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer , he placed his task in proven , young hands with good prospects for the future .	-3.9745
Both have played an active role in the selection of artists in the past and have helped to create flyers .	-5.5834
This year again , a 70-cent special stamp , designed by them , is available at every art station .	-7.5908
This year 's poster " Betzn " , designed by Volker Hahn , can also be purchased for eight euros .	-4.6394

1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement .	-2.4091
At that time , the Albachtener also made air of their displeasure .	-6.1132
At least five of them .	-1.0077
They did not want partout to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir " Cäcilia " there should be no more sangesleben in the district .	-5.0103

On her marriage to Hans von Borsody : Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband .	-2.5316
Heide Keller became a star on the " Traumschiff " .	-2.2512
Now she talks openly that the series could have had a joint guilt with Hans von Borsody on her marriage .	-5.9691
Heide Keller ( 76 ) made her famous role as chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the " Traumschiff " , but on January 1 , 2018 she went on board forever .	-4.7292
The series that made it the star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody ( 1929 - 2013 ) , with whom she was married for ten years .	-3.8211
" That could also have been a reason .	-2.6404
For I was awakened with this work , traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues took me true on eye level , " says Keller in conversation with the " picture on Sunday " .	-5.1164
First of all , she was only " the wife of Hans von Borsody " , but that changed with the " dream ship " .	-5.0389

" I don 't know if he liked it so well " .	-4.3230
She thinks it is possible that her former husband could have been envious , but " like many men Hans also shy about problems and feelings " .	-5.8087
Keller always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to know my fears , my weaknesses .	-4.5201
That means in good English : I have adjusted myself ' , as she says .	-6.5558
She always felt " not good enough for him .	-2.4568
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I was never in truth , even though I sometimes appeared frenzy and brave on stage .	-5.6358
I wanted our love to be forever " .	-2.5486
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner , Keller once again said yes , " although I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time . "	-7.4746
On the day before the official ceremony I sat in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything .	-4.7747
The marriage to Borsody also failed .	-2.4237
Why never dressed with men ?	-3.4103
Because I wanted too much .	-1.0796
Keller presented the love at the time " as in the film .	-4.2939
Unfortunately , this vision is not everyday .	-2.4531

The night fold , which regularly explores the city 's nightlife in the NZZ resort of Zurich , has dared to join the ZFF opening party this time .	-6.6536
Our wrinkle is not a moth , but a bit shy .	-4.2674
And the sheer glamour in which a green carpet is baptized on the six-fenced square blends it over fee .	-7.6285

The price for the best drink is not compelling .	-4.7313
And George Clooney , who has been promoting this brand for years , is not here in the evening either .	-3.1492
However , there is a face passing between local romance , cashier and kitchen articles , which is known to the observer : Peter Farrelly , director of the opening film .	-6.5480
His main character should not be far away .	-5.3553
And really : straight Viggo walks Mortensen , with soon sixty almost like a choir boy acting through the crowd .	-3.8737

Swen Bieletzki , Coach of the Handball Association Guides ASV Senden , could hardly grasp it : " So a bitter defeat " .	-6.1334
As in Steinhagen , such as Hüllhorst , you did not play badly over long periods , the senders .	-4.8120
Only the initial phase " we have completely slept " , the ASV trainer annoyed .	-5.3433
The landlords quickly did not start with 8 : 1 , including the early days that Bieletzki had taken .	-7.2126
" But then suddenly a ruck went through the team , " Bieletzki summarized the second quarter of an hour .	-4.7249
For the break , the backlog was only two goals .	-4.6047
In particular , Senden ’ s best , Marius Hintze , met another time at the stage .	-4.3552

And then ?	-0.6404
Griff the impartial into action .	-5.0085
Bieletzki is usually wary of seeking guilt among others .	-4.1245
But : The 120-Sekunden-Zeitstrafe , which Steffen Mühlhoff collected , " was a joke " .	-4.3591
LIT had laughed well and met four times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack .	-4.3463
The guys have fought great , stood up against seven men in the back and threw them into the empty gate .	-9.8282

The Coach had to change the system after 26 minutes .	-3.3175
After the injury of Nico Frerichs ( muscular problems ) - for him Luca Rehberg - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly over into a 4-2-3-1 , in which Niklas Thewes waited in front of the balls .	-5.4306

Westhues " Ding with the right snake struck at the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1 : 0 ( 71 ) .	-8.8620
20 minutes , which should be damned long .	-3.7005

Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift ( 79 ) .	-3.0542

The Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in Eveking ’ s Church of Peace .	-4.0566
There around 150 bikers met on Sunday to commit anything but ordinary worship .	-5.2988
From 10 a.m. , the Boliden were ready before the church entrance portal .	-7.1383
At first , the biker lobster was on the program and it was possible to grow with coffee and cake or even with a defiant curry sausage .	-8.6819
In addition to the MoGo-Team , the Holy Riders , a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach , were also present .	-3.6846
During the Biker service , the priest , Dirk Grzegorek , held the preaching .	-5.1760
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided for the musical undertone .	-4.7085
" Although the bikers prefer blues rock , Valerie Lill prefers poetical-quiet tones " , says parish Frank Schröder .	-5.6753
This , too , was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle services yesterday .	-5.3917
Follow-orfer Heimatverein celebrates big festival : After the apple comes the milk comes milk .	-5.5610
Borisch was also active during the actual day of action .	-3.5239
She served her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes .	-2.7760
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest .	-2.8104
He had his apple press in his luggage and showed his astonishing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice .	-4.1292
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel .	-3.7056
With a little muscle force , a finely crushed mass has been removed from the apples .	-4.6703
Not many of the children could yet imagine how this should become a tasty drink .	-4.8913
But they were also able to look at this important step at this late Friday afternoon .	-4.6374
In forms packed and wrapped by nets , Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces that look a bit like a hardness box for layer on top of each other .	-9.2995
Thanks to some technical support , the last step in the work was no longer so difficult .	-4.7353
The freshly pressed juice went on and down into a large vessel .	-5.4527
But the farmer had already completed his specialties .	-4.1468
He opened his treasure chest and presented the latest feather white to older visitors .	-4.3840
The demand for the good drop " Made in Füchtorf " was correspondingly large .	-3.2059
In a cosy atmosphere , the parents came into contact , while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press , but also discover the built up refuge for themselves .	-7.3130
Also active members of the former soldier ’ s adolescent comrade committed themselves in the festivities and invited to short matches at some stations .	-10.0957
The Heimatverein will also offer an action day next year .	-4.4558
But then , as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized , the home will not be in the heart of the thrill of the scene .	-5.5681
Instead , a farm will be visited .	-1.4593
That is also obvious because of the subject : after all , milk will then be around .	-5.3011
1 : 4 versus Frankfurt : Hanover with fourth season bankruptcy : " Beschissene Situation "	-7.4572
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat successively coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointing professionals from Hannover 96 to meet and spoke to them courage .	-5.1416
There were a lot of positive things before 1 : 4 ( 0 : 2 ) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt , however , .	-5.4559
" It 's a lazy situation , but you have to go out as a team , " said 96-soccer professional Pirmin Schwegler and shouted : " This is of course disappointing , because you always take a lot off " .	-7.3959
The more victorious Lower Saxony , for which only Florent Muslija ( 86th ) met , is at the bottom of two meters and is a descent candidate in its current constitution .	-7.2255
On the other hand , Frankfurt celebrated the first season home victory by the superior Ante Rebic .	-5.3399
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute , Rebic ( 45th + 1 ) , Jonathan de Guzmán ( 59th ) and Luka Jovic ( 89th ) reached the goals for the DFB Cup winner after the successful rehearsal for the European League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table .	-4.7415
Croatia ’ s Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hessen and never got to grips with Hanover ’ s defenses .	-11.4127
The long troubled storms following the World Cup showed with its speed and assertiveness why it is so valuable for harmony .	-6.3600
In addition to Rebic , Brazilians borrowed from the FC Liverpool stood Allan for the first time in the initial formation of Frankfurt , which began to swear .	-6.4864
For the first time , a headball of Lucas Torró ( 17 ) on the network of counterfeit scooters was in danger .	-9.0156
Six minutes later , Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense against Brazil ’ s Felipe , who replaced Kevin Wimmer ( Rücken ) in the short term .	-9.4730
The leadership for the budget leaders was almost inevitable and entirely deserved .	-5.3658
Filip Kostic hob raised the ball after a defensive corner in the penalty room , Haller prolonged by head to the gate where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot .	-6.4753
It was the first Bundesliga meeting for the defensive players won by the French branch league AJ Auxerre in the summer .	-5.6925
And Frankfurt continued before the break .	-2.6965
This time , Haller went to his Sturmpartner Rebic , who was skillfully danced and left 96-Torwart Michael Esser with no chance .	-8.6368
In the half-time , Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak idea of his elf and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt .	-7.4414
The Lower Saxons now played a little bolder forward , but ignited ideas remained in place until the end , when the connection buffer was still successful .	-8.3739
The Hessen were much more efficient .	-3.0286
After a short hour , Rebic started a solo and then put right on De Guzmán , who had to push the ball into the empty gate .	-6.7637
The rest was only a show run for the Frankfurt guests , even Jovic met one minute before the end .	-5.3589
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile .	-2.1528
The room was very clean and comfortable .	-6.9773

Geisingen : Geisinger Christians celebrate Heilig-Kreuz-Fest	-2.6914
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross feast on September 14 or on Sunday afterwards .	-3.7807
The festival service takes place in the city church , then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the closing ceremony .	-5.9371
The Holy Cross Church houses the shielded Christ , who comes from the Thirty Years ’ War and shot on which the legend is shot after a Swedish soldier .	-7.6901
Blood flowed out of the rubble .	-5.2921
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shrine of Christ , which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church .	-5.3177
This is still unfinished , only the old building is standing , the lack of a long house is indicated by the trees .	-7.5688
In his preaching , parish Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope , comfort and life .	-3.4392
The divine service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geisinger parish .	-4.7584
After the divine service the procession took place to the Holy Cross Church and with the final blessing ended the church part of the Crucifixion .	-13.2391
For many years , the Catholic Church choir has been inviting the Catholic parish home to the secular part of the festival .	-6.4503
The members of the choir provided the visitors with hearty food and a wide range of cakes and weather adapted , farm eggs .	-5.7787
In the afternoon , the parish still offered guided tours around the town church , Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish of the parish about the damage to façade , roof , sandstone works and windows , as well as the upcoming building work that will be dragging on until next year .	-6.8853
After the rumour has been around for some time , the damage could be identified more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more specifically .	-6.6846
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned , because the damage already done a few years ago has increased , but more has also been found , which has only been made possible by the use of scaffolding .	-7.6666
The Sockelverputzarbeiten have been completed , before the winter it is planned to start work on the natural stone and it is hoped to complete almost half of this work this year .	-9.5204
Inauguration : New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße .	-3.4393
The Donau-Iller Life Aid opens a new home for disabled people in the Münsterblickstraße .	-4.6488
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße a very special house is now being handed over to his determination - all of those present were in agreement on the inauguration date .	-9.5375
After all , the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in Donau-Iller ’ s home for some time now need the special architecture of the new building .	-5.2097
Wide corridors , corridors and doors , larger rooms and accessibility access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept .	-3.6984
The first plans began about eight years ago , when the former US Army officer building was put to the test for the residents with Handycap : " The house had come into the years and no longer in the equipment , " Bader explained retrospectively .	-7.2337
In 2016 , the excavators moved to the house .	-3.6127
The new building should be made as friendly and light as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it , according to the architect .	-5.4831
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new home for the .	-4.1530
Around EUR 4.6 million invested life aid in new construction .	-4.0950
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million , the district of Schwaben EUR 450000 .	-3.7409
According to architect Bader , the construction works have remained within the planned framework , both in terms of time and in terms of financial .	-5.9596
He was also thanked by the managing director of life aid , Jürgen Heinz .	-4.0148
The splitting between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy .	-5.1089
However , the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many presets that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without help .	-7.2554
Similarly , the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben , Gertrud Kreutmayer , said : " The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants , who need tools to be mobile " .	-5.6625
At the same time the housing and functionality had been well combined , Kreutmayer said .	-5.2903
And again : " The plot in this situation is a real happiness because it is no longer available in today 's situation " .	-5.4685
Overall , the new residential home in the Münsterblickstraße offers space for almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities divided into three residential groups .	-6.0945
We are proud to be Managing Director Heinz at the eleven full-time workers , all of whom are employed at a tariff .	-7.5299
Germany : Schwesig laments differences between East and West	-2.4153
Berlin - Before the day of unity , the Deputy SPD Federal President Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to be deprived of East Germany .	-4.6528
There are differences that hurt unity after almost 30 years .	-2.3052
With these differences , we cannot be satisfied , " the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern said , " Day mirrors on Sunday " .	-4.7624
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country .	-2.4488
It is unacceptable that East Germany , on average , worked longer than the people of West Germany , but received 15 % less salary .	-3.8263
" I can 't explain this almost 30 years after German unity , " said Schwesig .	-3.9407
North Korea : Does this shameful dog stop the Korean conflict ?	-3.8877
The one-year Pungsan-Jagdhund is meant to smooth the waves between the two Koreas .	-4.7733
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul , Pyongyang has given a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs .	-4.0137
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday , the two dogs , about a year old , reached their destination on Thursday .	-4.5328
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom , together with three kilograms of dog feed , in order to ' facilitate animal reconciliation ' .	-8.9904
The dogs with the thick white coat , pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent .	-2.9364
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .	-8.1542
The North ’ s friendships were announced this year at the third summit between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September .	-4.4149
Both countries also agreed to join forces in international sporting competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and jointly apply for the 2032 Olympic Games to be held .	-5.3774
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile engines in the course of mutual rapprochement .	-4.1865
Austria ’ s Moveable History in the Mirror of 99 Documents	-2.5949
What is Austria ?	-0.5187
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic , which has been celebrated in this commemoration year for almost ten months , numerous new books have been published , most of which answer this question in retrospect to the past hundred years .	-5.7161
Wolfgang Maderthaner , historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive , will present a very different presentation in the magnificent " Bilderbuch " Austria , which will be published on October 1 .	-7.5104
New Week , New Opportunity for the Government	-1.8424
Back to substantive work - that is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition that is beginning today .	-5.0603
Hardly an interview , hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU , SPD and also from the CSU recently did not mention the " return to the work of substance " mantraartig .	-7.5935
This may have led some craftsmen , doctors , cashiers and other working-class citizens in that country to the legitimate question of what the difference is between work and work , but be it .	-9.1529
If the federal government is now ready to devote itself to its task - governance - it should not now be stopped by debating terms .	-7.1229
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks may already show Monday .	-5.6823
In the evening , the leaders of the governing parties come together to form the coalition committee .	-3.6542
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early ; a lesson from all the quarrel .	-4.0848
First of all , however , there are conflict-prone issues on the agenda with diesel equipment and the specialist immigration law .	-6.4591
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get off the ground with exchange-rate premiums , SPD and CDU see manufacturers in a duty to retrofit older diesel .	-6.4909
While a rapprochement has been recorded in the diesel crisis over the weekend , the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned specialist immigration law .	-6.3063
The SPD is calling for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers working or training .	-4.1911
The Union is strongly opposed to the ' change of track ' from the asylum system to the labour market .	-3.4529
So there will again be quarrels among coalition partners - and how should it be different ?	-6.4321
Not equals and equals have joined forces with GroKo , but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities .	-6.1613
Dispute is good .	-2.3112
Without controversy , a society characterized by so diverse , sometimes contradictory , interests will not move forward .	-5.6028
In order to be constructive , however , disputes must not be re-examined for partisan reasons about being or not being .	-9.6414
This is still about politics , not theatre .	-2.8645
The Union and the SPD should argue , but always have a view of the reality of people 's lives .	-5.8765
What is feasible and useful to many ?	-2.1248
This is a key issue that can be addressed pragmatically - and thus regain confidence - both the diesel issue and the Spurwechsel issue .	-8.1727
That is why the parties must now fight .	-4.5650
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger .	-2.3276
Minister in Visier	-2.3721
Does the Minister of Labour violate the law in force ?	-3.8595
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this .	-2.6340
" Really day and night " their legalists had worked on social security reform , reported an oversized social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago .	-6.0863
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger , the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein ( FPÖ ) comes as a surprise - it now brings the matter to Parliament via request .	-5.3229
She assumes that " the Minister only expresses her enthusiasm for the use of her team and in no way wanted to declare violations of the law of service in front of running cameras " .	-8.2621
Nevertheless , they now have questions to be able to free Har ­ tinger from any suspicion ' .	-5.2094
Police are riding a street in search of women 's careers .	-4.7736
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this .	-3.2279
There is now confirmation .	-1.8161
Since early Saturday morning , the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug .	-4.0234
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday .	-3.3031
It was anticipated that the investigators had previously set up an archaeologist .	-4.7074
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones , together with his guide , was able to limit the relevant place to a few meters in the multi-time use .	-7.8394
In addition , a ground anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said road piece .	-6.1259
For more than a year now prosecutors and criminal prosecutors have been working on the missing case .	-5.3320
A cycle path has been locked at Marxgrün and investigated with sonars , because investigators suspect that Heike ’ s body could have been stunned in the course of the rebuilding of the state road 30 years ago .	-7.7073
Colouring powder and eggs : riots in Barcelona before Catalonia ’ s anniversary	-3.7802
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial referendum on independence in Catalonia .	-2.6110
But there are already riots .	-3.9656
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation in the autumn of 2017 . , , is .	-4.2910
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017 , clashes between separatists and the police have taken place in the centre of Barcelona .	-3.9339
Catalan security forces were attacked , among other things , by advocates of independence , with colour powders , when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard .	-6.0236
Some 3 000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honour their colleagues with a rally that last year was in operation in the polling stations as an illegal referendum .	-7.2932
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting , violence was also at the time .	-4.8983
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and the central security forces separate , reported Spanish media .	-3.8615
Some of the around 6000 separatists would then have tried to break through the police chain by force , and , among other things , the officials were using colour bags and eggs .	-7.4868
Six people have been arrested , 24 others have been slightly injured , and the authorities have been called upon to do so .	-5.4238
Monday marks the first anniversary of the referendum on independence .	-2.5699
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the affluent region of Spain , the central government in Madrid in Catalonia in the autumn of 2017 had been forced to manage .	-6.0011
The then regional president , Carles Puigdemont , fled to exile in Belgium .	-2.5659
Other politicians were also abroad .	-3.5139
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody .	-3.5732
New elections were held in the region in December .	-1.6088
After the arrival of the new Catalan government in May , the forced administration ended .	-4.4413
But the new regional president , Quim Torra , also insists on the ' right to self-determination ' of Catalans .	-2.9695
Fußball : Oberliga Westfalen : Versammelte Ratlosigkeit : FC Gütersloh und RW Ahlen trennen sich torlos .	-2.1718
Red and white Ahlen continues on the spot .	-4.2861
In the FC Gütersloh , too , there was only one 0 : 0 decision .	-5.9728
The closing lights and the third last puppets turned them off before 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as a gathered helplessness .	-7.8449
The first half was manageable from the entertainment factor .	-2.6597
Those who would prefer to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so carefree .	-6.0177
There was no risk of missing a chance because there was virtually no one .	-4.2232
First shot after half an hour	-1.1618
For the first ( harmless ) torch of the entire lot recorded freight sloh Nick Flock in the 28th minute .	-4.8929
The best - and in principle only real - possibility was given by the Ahlener , when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling , after 32 minutes with a shot from the penal border , forced a parade .	-6.1312
The hosts were even more harmless .	-2.1129
Their most effective action was an early change .	-3.0172
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged for injuries , for whom Sinan Aygün came .	-5.0362
After the change , both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom .	-4.3386
At the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel , who was 18 metres short of the housing and after an hour , was also active for the first time .	-8.0315
After a conquest of Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed .	-3.0595
The swiftly presented Konter over Sinan Aygün crowned " Nick Flock ( 62 . ) with a slight shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann .	-5.5863
In addition , with a head ball from Wieckowicz ( 66th ) , they moved to a corner ball from Ex-Ahleners Tim Manstein .	-6.0390
RWA-Interimstrainer Angelo Daut reacted , first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy ( 60 . ) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel ( 70 . ) .	-3.1502
Nothing was done .	-5.4610
More than optical superiority , thanks to its own initiative , the Ahlener did not come about .	-4.6153
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance , but also that did not bring anything .	-4.3082
Angelo Daut endeavoured to highlight the positive : " I like having played to zero " , but unfortunately the zero was also on the front .	-7.1017
" This time we were not as tordangerously as we were against woodworking and although our opponent had no desire to play here " , RW Ahlens Interimstrainer noted .	-7.0265
Offensively " pushed everything so a bit " against a team that only wanted to defend .	-5.0698
In any case , I did not feel that we could get a counter-tor , " Daut says .	-4.7016
But , as a spectator , one did not feel as if his team were shooting a gateway .	-7.3337
The idea was too weak for that .	-3.8498
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt : Fortunately there is enough chalk .	-2.1694
This is what Brigitte Ransmann , Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are looking for from the Reckenfelder Tafelausestelle , for which these donations are intended . , , , and , , , , , , , , , , . , , the are . ,	-10.8189
The volunteers insure : " These donations remain in Reckenfeld " .	-4.8401
At the opening , the sky was shining blue and the place was slightly empty , but that should change over the course of the day .	-7.4757
For : " Here it is so beautiful sociable , therefore we are here today " , said a visitor .	-5.0231
The organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper prise Humor .	-4.5264
For the couple Brockmann , who should actually be weighed up against food , Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term .	-3.8776
Verena ( daughter of Ferdi Kreimer ) has become ill .	-1.6667
But there is enough chalk .	-1.8592
And the " replacement " didn 't let it take to entertain more and more people in between .	-8.3224
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a late hour .	-4.9308
" Just great " , Marcel Kreimer joked .	-3.7060
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to present the opening date this time in his schedule .	-3.0748
He is pleased about the many active players with their stands , including mostly clubs .	-7.1417
" Actually there should not be something like a cube at all " , he thanked for the action of the male choir .	-5.1222
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivities held in September and the " Clean up " action .	-6.2291
Our garden town has a colorful look - this is what is going on .	-5.8995
Then the Maikranz was taken off by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klitem with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarters .	-5.6558
A lot of stalls have been worked for the good .	-8.6291
From sweetness to heart everything was to have .	-3.1028
Stefan Hagemeyer , who lives in Reckenfeld only a year ago , was creative in his decoration rooms .	-3.9329
He had a lot more to offer for furniers , for beer lids with reckenfelder motives and .	-8.1567
A speciality was offered by three Reckenfelder Imker : " Reckenfelder Honig " , brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka , Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschsch.	-3.4364
The latter has one more specialty .	-4.0870
Honey cake in the glass , naturally with honey from my own production .	-2.5234
The little elsa had to access again and again , so well tasted the cakes .	-5.9702
The conviviality is that the visitors were not allowed to linger for a long time until the evening hours , even without a stage program .	-8.4886
Schmierereien mit lokalpolitischer Botschaft : Keine gelungene Werbung für Skateanlage .	-3.5079
In Lengerich , unknown people hardly promoted the construction of a skatepark .	-7.9228
In several places there are corresponding lubricants , says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN .	-5.2954
In at least one case , criminal charges have been brought against the police for material damage .	-5.2809
In large letters , the three words " Skatepark für Lengerich ! " are denounced on signs , among other things , at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Town . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.8476
Michael Rottmann , manager of the hall , reports that an appropriate font was discovered at the staircase of the Gempt-Bistro after the professional election fair on 19 September .	-6.8486
As the short message was apparently " only " left with an Edding , they could easily be removed .	-6.1030
" Only a few days later this was again there , this time sprayed up " , says Rottmann .	-6.5721
It assumes that the corresponding advertisement must be replaced .	-4.0645
A special note is given in this case by the fact that several large companies are also called Lengerich .	-8.8781
If the skatepark is built , it is also to be made possible by sponsors .	-5.8389
Promises have already been made , as Jörg Hesselmann explains , without name , from the school , sport and culture .	-5.1916
However , it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the molded table .	-5.7360
Local politics and administration have been working on the subject of skatepark for years .	-4.9123
After the old LWL clinic had been dismantled , the search for an alternative location began .	-4.7158
After all , the majority of the Council was in favour of the fire-fighting parking lot .	-5.9866
However , this was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against building at this point .	-5.7071
At the end of June , a U-turn followed .	-2.5862
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area .	-3.8221
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning .	-3.9823
The last word , then , is the City Council .	-3.8515

Impaired air traffic control is getting worse .	-5.0776
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer , the German air traffic controllers will not see any signs of improvement next year .	-4.2291
" This year we had wind , 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm , " said the chief of the air traffic control union , Matthias Maas , the German press agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg .	-4.6190
An important reason for the many delays and flight failures is the long-standing lack of staff in European air traffic control systems , for which there is no quick solution .	-5.9894
" The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year , but the training of new pilots takes four to five years , " said the trade unionist .	-3.5686
Across Europe , the market for ready-trained pilots is empty .	-5.0260
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone , around a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace .	-3.7609
Maas once again criticised the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit .	-2.7812
In the Hanseatic city , representatives of the Federal Government , countries , air traffic control , airlines and airports come together on Friday to address the causes of delays .	-4.6795
" If you want to talk about additional occupational compression and overtime hours , that will not go without us " , the head of the GdF , who has many members in the federal air traffic control system .	-7.3475
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the lottery malaise .	-3.6547
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low .	-3.4741
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings in national air navigation systems have now been fully integrated into the operational business .	-7.3872
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer ( CSU ) to work in Brussels for regulations that do not leave the air even more closed to air safety .	-11.6379
At the moment , the EU ’ s targets would be coordinated by 2024 , and further tightening would be feared .	-5.8649
The EU is under constant pressure from airlines .	-2.0377
" Ryanair chief Michael O 'Leary and his colleagues now harvest exactly what they have sown in recent years , " said Maas .	-4.0345
He hopes that the high delay costs for airlines will lead to a rethink .	-5.6143
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German Air Safety Authority ( DFS ) offers a " coherent training and future pact " , said Maas .	-4.9962
The annual addition of 120 pilotage tubes , announced so far , over the next five years , is precisely sufficient to offset age-related declines .	-7.0681

The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group .	-3.1064
According to the wishes of Thyssenkrupp-Interimschef Guido Kerkhoff , who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday , the crisis group is to be split into two independent companies .	-10.3828
Both companies are to have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange .	-9.8572
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known administrative cuts .	-4.3825

Barcelona : Violence in demos of policemen and Catalan advocates of independence . : . , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.0679
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan defenders of independence in Barcelona have led to violent clashes with many injured .	-8.8827
According to the city council , on Saturday around 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered together , as well as some 6000 independency supporters .	-7.2183
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests apart with a large one .	-4.6392
According to the forces of independence , however , they have repeatedly tried to break the safety barrier .	-6.3703
They would have attacked the officials with paint and sausages .	-4.8217
According to the figures , there were also various protests among the participants .	-5.3706
According to rescue forces , 24 people were injured .	-2.5571
The police said that there were six arrests .	-2.2126
Better salaries and appreciation for colleagues	-2.6938
The policemen , with their demonstration , wanted to pay tribute to those colleagues who , almost exactly a year ago , opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia banned by the Spanish central government .	-6.7513
At the same time , they demanded better salaries .	-1.7279
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve far more than they do .	-4.0154
The demonstrators found it a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona , in particular .	-6.9363
" Why did they come here to protest ? " asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency .	-3.8254
It is only to provoke and celebrate the fact that a year ago they were perverted .	-5.5891
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands , who only wanted to give his name to Daniel , rejected the charge .	-4.1708
" Of course we want to support our comrades who last year only did their duty : defend the law , " he said .	-3.3347
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona , because that is a great European city and there is more echo here .	-3.9542
He and his colleagues were " not come to provoke " , the policeman assured .	-4.2465

Football : Juve-Trainer praises the best game in the world : Ronaldo 's best game .	-5.0562
The Portuguese star player " played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia " , praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3 : 1 ( 1 : 1 ) victory of the record master against the SSC Naples .	-4.3851
For the trainer , the expensive bought star was also the decisive man in the important match against the persecutors without his own gate .	-7.6581
" Ronaldo had lots of fun and makes it good , " said Allegri .	-5.4861
Although we started with tactical mistakes , Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew up .	-3.9006
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo , Juve turned the game after the early lag through the hit of Dries Mertens ( 10th minute ) and suspended the worst persecutor for the time being .	-9.5341
The Torjäger , brought by Real Madrid , first raised the former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic , who took the lead with a double pack ( 26th / 49th ) .	-6.2958
And Ronaldo , after a corner by headball , did the preparatory work for the meeting of the defender , Leonardo Bonucci ( 76th ) , who just had to push in front of the line .	-8.7941
" He gives many templates " , the coach praised .	-2.7380
But , of course , Allegri also wants to see goals of the attacker , who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the Rekord-Torschütze .	-4.8868
" We need to be better at serving him , " the coach asked .	-4.5122
Bester Juve-Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account .	-2.1013
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than € 100 million , Juventus ’ superpower seems to become even more oppressive .	-4.4772
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in series A. At 21 points , the master of the past seven years has already six meters ahead of Naples .	-6.4208
The table second , trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti , was not without chance against Turin .	-5.4173
But no later than after the reference to Mario Rui ( 58 ) , who had already been rejected , the top part was decided .	-6.5727
The Portuguese had to leave the place after a hard entry against Paulo Dybala with yellow red .	-4.9634
" We played well against a good Naples , " commented the Turiner Coach .	-2.0114
Emre Can was also allowed to feel there .	-5.6306
The German national player got his way at Juve .	-4.7118
The professional won by the FC Liverpool was used for all seven league matches .	-5.1152
The midfielder also played in the Champion League match against Valencia , which Allegri said with the " half hour " : Ronaldo was at the 2 : 0 victory of the Turiner flown from the place and is closed for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern .	-7.7090
Kanye West changes its name	-2.0205
Rapper Kanye West made a special appearance at the US TV show " Saturday Night Live " at the weekend .	-4.6986
Among other things , his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water compound caused scratches and question marks among viewers .	-5.7200
In addition , the 41-year-old announced a change in name on time to publish his new album .	-4.1755
So let 's call it " Ye " , the musician says .	-6.4588
" The character , formerly known as Kanye West , " twittered in line with the late singer Prince when he put his artist name .	-7.0169
But the pseudonym is no news .	-2.2926
Already the tenth album was released under this name .	-2.5758
In an interview with the radio station KRRL the artist explained that " Ye " had a religious meaning for him .	-5.1394
" I think " Ye " is the most used word in the Bible and there it means " du " , so the rapper .	-2.7922
Football : Kreisliga A1 Münster : Endlich !	-2.1671

Hoetmars Trainer Averhage made his disappointment no secret .	-3.5682
That was a weak game of ours today .	-2.7753
The opponent was more hands-on , we have put him as good as never before " .	-8.6575
Grade two chances in 90 minutes , so you can only rarely make games positive .	-6.1393
Football league A1 : SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0 : 2 ( 0 : 1 ) photo : Heinz Schwackenberg .	-2.4264
Also the SG had only two possibilities in the first passage , the first but used Maik Krause from a pointed angle to the early lead ( 7 ) .	-5.5027
In the 43rd minute , Steffen Uphus could have increased , but after great preliminary work by Krause he was vacant .	-9.1375
The hosts had only one double option when Moritz Höne failed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper .	-5.4256
After the break , the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities .	-3.4042
But Uphus ( 49th ) , Julian Turl ( 61 , ) and Heinz Linnemann ( 69th ) all gave .	-2.6881
In addition , Niklas Eilmann could not use a trailer - Louis Kortenjann had rescued a trailer with his hand on the line and saw Red for that .	-8.9568
Only when Nils Berheide stoned the ball over the line was the game decided ( 81. ) .	-5.1054
" We had criticised ourselves hard beforehand , that was different today than in the last few weeks , " said Florian Kraus 's .	-8.7172
Sendenhorst : J. Schomacher - Linnemann , Scholz , Eilmann , Mey , Kraus , Krause ( 77th Berheide ) , L. Hartleif , Uphus , Abu Dalal ( 90th Leibig ) , Turl .	-1.7734

Football : Kreisliga A2 Münster : Spektakelfußball in Albachten : GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3 : 4 .	-2.8454
" I don 't know what I think about it , " he said .	-4.5430
" We didn 't get any access to them " , he presumably used to refer to the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger , but also to all the other Green White , who played with collective offensive .	-8.7696
However , he could laugh : " A dreadful victory " , he said , softened and withdrew from dancing players , on the other hand , was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points .	-7.9957
It is worth noting that after a duel of two teams , one of which is Albachten to play the championship and the other , Albersloh , is fighting for the class halt .	-6.3386
With understandably mixed feelings , GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back to the 90 minutes behind him .	-2.3436
" This was by far our best season performance , " he says .	-2.1913
" As we come back after the 0 : 2 , as we oppose one of the league 's top teams throughout the game time , this was really phenomenal " .	-6.4365
This makes it all the more bitter that we now have to go home with empty hands .	-4.6460
Top Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12th season meeting in leadership ( 24 ) .	-5.0020
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal .	-2.5960
The 2 : 0 he placed on the left side mustervalid on Fabian Fröhning ( 39 ) .	-3.7549
We knew that , but that is not the way to get a player completely out of the . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.2759
" This was already madness , what made " , Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent neidlos .	-5.5884
Shortly before the change of the page , his own elf made the balance : McGill ’ s free movement from left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia Torhüter Hinkerohe through the long torque ( 45. ) .	-7.7154
After the change of direction , it was McGill who rebuilt ( 59 ) .	-5.8358
Then it went on and on .	-4.1455
It was a tough , action-packed game .	-2.1389
Nübel shocked Albachten again ( 64. ) , only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann ( 69th ) .	-4.1957
Albersloh was no longer able to repeat the last Concordia meeting ( 80th ) .	-5.6718
We must now concentrate fully on Wednesday .	-2.1542
" The game against Schapdetten , that is what we must win now , " said Lewandowski .	-3.4409

Several media corresponded in the evening to a joint letter from the College of Saxony .	-4.7913
A confirmation of the association was not available at first .	-4.4383
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligisten .	-4.2282

For Christian Wulff , the term was too short : as president , he was not in Tutzings ’ Evangelical Academy .	-4.3695

" Both adults and men were suitable " was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck .	-4.4724
As cabaret dancers , the understanding of the sexes prevailed , not only with humour and warmth of heart for the ( felt ) woman and what else could there be , but also with music .	-7.4699
The mini-guitar set her up and also mastered her violin .	-4.0824
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wings .	-2.6549
One is the male sparring partner , who sometimes comes to the end of the sentence , and another a true pianist : so congenially harmoniously accompanied by sweetener Teubner that some may have wished for a solo .	-7.0777
This was also the case with Beethoven and Chopin , but differently , as was the case with the Red Fades of the evening .	-4.7243
Teubner had put a paradox into play : the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner but does not open the door .	-5.7740
A closed door without partner does not bring any benefits .	-3.2983
The piano soloist now demonstrates the same thing : What would have happened to Mozart 's compositions if " Nannerl " had opened the door unexpectedly ?	-6.9348
So Süverkrüp glides into improvisations , from Bach 's " O Haupt full of blood and wounds " into the " song of death " , and from Mozart 's g-minor symphony into a playful dancehall .	-5.1870

But the angry increased over the many missed opportunities .	-4.8782
The concentration in the end left his team miss this time .	-4.5157
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a backlog , lay behind the break with 11 : 12 and later with 15 : 18 ( 45 . ) .	-6.4739
It was only by the end that the broader bank of the hosts made a decisive difference .	-6.3517

" This was a giant step for a cool season .	-2.0664
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league .	-2.3062
This is what we have now worked out , " says coach Dominik Münch , after almost impeccable performance of his team at the overthrown table leader .	-8.3161
The guests dominated the first passage almost at will .	-4.8426
Over 4 : 1 , 16 : 10 and 22 : 12 he went to the runner-up of the previous year with 25 : 15 .	-3.5856
Eating was accepted in the duel but did not come into play .	-6.1256
We have done it well .	-2.4900
Our opponent has run a high risk but has also produced a number of tickets .	-5.6999
In the second sentence , the BSV already had 12 : 8 " Essen switched the acceptance to three-gain levels .	-7.2915
We were unable to keep the pressure on the attack .	-4.9381
Food has been swept away , and we have let ourselves be lulled in a bit ' , Münch continued .	-8.1778
At 18 : 17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had the nose ahead .	-4.9636
Although Ostbevern resisted at 19 : 24 , four sentences were still in place , but the fifth attempt was his goal .	-8.1904
" The game was now a class better " , the tutor was at a higher level .	-4.7177
Maike Rüdingloh and last of all Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV applied the sheet in the third section from 14 : 16 to 25 : 21 .	-5.1088
Münch : " Here we have played consistently and quietly " .	-3.3417

The Turkish community in Germany ( TGD ) has criticised the way in which the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the major Ditib mosque in Cologne .	-3.5743
" In the German-Turkish relationship , the mosque opening in Cologne left behind a havoc that can only be summarized with difficulty , " said the chairman of the TGD , Gökay Sofuoglu , the German editorial network .	-7.3711
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance of a common , conciliatory appearance .	-3.8497
" Instead of emphasizing the affiliation of Muslims with Germany side by side with German leaders , Erdogan has used the date for his purposes , " complained Sofuoglu .	-4.7530
The widespread exclusion of the German public has encouraged ' many reservations ' .	-3.5117

From pure fruit production to ecology	-2.9171
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle the 125-year existence of the Kreisverbands für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated .	-3.7937
On September 29 , 1893 , with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus , the last foundation impulse for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach was set , and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening .	-5.9940
However , he was still different at the time : when " Kulmbach City and Land District Association " he was raised from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893 .	-7.5091
Also the purpose of the fruit growing association differed from today 's work - in fact it was just about fruit growing , about flowers and horticulture that nobody thought about .	-7.8869
" At that time , in the Enlightenment era , the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites , " explained county nurse Günter Dippold in his festive presentation .	-4.4917
Fruit trees should be lined up by highways , and schools have created so-called industrial gardens .	-7.2966
Obstanbau is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district , which comprises approximately 7000 members .	-5.9829
But the spectrum is far from exhausted .	-2.1664
Natural horticulture , biological plant protection , village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role , as do communicating knowledge , healthy nutrition and youth work .	-6.1126
The members of the Hutschdorfer Youth Group " Maulwürfe " showed how versatile the tasks of a garden construction association are .	-5.3487
" Youth work is urgently needed , especially in the digital age , " said Günter Reif , Chairman of the circle , and also OB Henry Schramm , emphasizing how important experiences in nature are for life .	-5.9841
The chestnut collection was a huge matter for us children , I doubt that you can collect a lot of fun with Smartphone & Co .	-6.5449
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary .	-2.7214
" Where they are supposed to stand , the district association " , supplemented Landrat Söllner and emphasized the particular importance of the gardens for the villages .	-6.1429
The association stands for ecology , beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village .	-3.1895
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt about district managers and expert Friedhelm Haun .	-5.9381
He led the many visitors with an image presentation through the long history of the association and reported , among other things , the need for self-sufficiency after the war .	-4.8438
In the past everything came from the garden , for the winter it was dosed .	-3.9718
At the end of the 1950s , however , the garden turned into a ornamental and residential garden .	-4.6412
" Nature has endured , it was there before us and we have to follow it " , the expert argued for fruit and nut trees .	-5.8736
For this reason , for the gardening associations , there is an incentive not to let our homeland remain beautiful and worth living .	-7.8237
It is also to be welcomed by the new citizens in our clubs that the President of the Bavarian State Association , Wolfram Vaitl , added .	-4.5875
" We must stop the blatant decline in insects , we owe our children and grandchildren " , Günter Reif concluded the successful festival , which was solemnly surrounded by the tower shops of the music association Thurnau .	-5.7550

Under the title " Ele não " ( in German : " Der nicht " ) , women 's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military .	-3.4218
In the social networks , too , the associations against Bolsonaros mobilized racist and fraud-despising statements .	-5.9374
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo .	-2.5548
In Brazil ’ s capital , protests were mixed with a rally by the Brazilian Workers ’ Party ’ s presidential candidate , Fernando Haddad .	-3.4782
He was replaced by ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva , who was sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore cannot stand for election .	-4.3604
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7 .	-2.4411
As an ex-mayor of São Paulo ’ s Millionenstadt , Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in surveys .	-5.3329
While the " Trump of Brazil " has long interfered in politics , it has recently become an anti-system leader .	-9.4491

After the release of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as solo artist .	-3.1656
He sold about three million records in Denmark .	-2.2359

Rocknacht in the shoe factory : volume at pressure hammer level .	-4.2308
The band names of " Here We Stand " , " Tiger Bonesaw " and " The Ignition " are the only ones that make this rocky live band live on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik .	-8.8142
After the sound check and shortly before the concert start , the musicians even take time for a group photo .	-4.4528
There is no trace of lamp fever .	-4.6896
After that the rock protagonists from Ahlen and surroundings - all in association with the Booking Agency " Mosquito " from Oelde - with their bands lautstark the approximately 120 visitors of the " Mint Mosquito " -Rocknacht visibly excite .	-14.9919
Already the quartet " Tiger Bonesaw " with Frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to start the concert with the latest unknown pieces from his own pen and the forthcoming CD .	-5.5353
In front of the stage , the band is danced to the voice and impressing interaction .	-7.6950
Although " addition " calls are not to be heard , " Tiger Bonesaw " then left the stage to the Trio " Here We Stand " .	-5.6064
Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock , demonstrating guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn , Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds , sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s .	-4.7725
After the " High Energy Rock " of the " Tigers " a synthesizer is used for " Here We Stand " in addition to the guitar .	-4.2538
Not only the longing , almost ball-like " Take Me Home " impresses with the change of melodic passages to the gitarrenic rock riffs of the multi-layered songs .	-7.2496
The quartet " The Ignition " from Tönnishäuschen has , however , gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005 .	-5.3364
The band will be presenting their hardrock on Saturday .	-9.4598
The fact that " The Ignition " with her performances to a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis on the tour in China in 2017 - has special stage experience is obvious and incomprehensible .	-5.1694
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann , together with the band , also sets his own accents in the single covered song of the evening , " Word Up " by Cameo from the 80s .	-5.8163
The sound is even more sophisticated than before , with guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivering a cheerful solo while running through the audience .	-9.3603
A certain volume is genrebedingt bei ei ­ nem solchen Hardrock-Konzert selbstverständlich dazu : Bei der " Mint Mosquito " - Rocknacht liegt die laut Auskunft des Mischpult-Teams beim Dreier-Konzert von " Here We Stand " , " Tiger Bonesaw " und " The Ignition " bei etwa 98 Dezibel .	-3.3424
This is due , for example , to the pressure hammer level , but it is still well below the " Wacken-Fesitvals " controls , to which " The Ignition " refers on their website .	-7.6203
The Ahlener audience doesn ’ t need to eat this rocknacht , however , as 120 in , in , in , in , . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.8725
After almost four hours , the three bands of the tougher , rocky Gangart have long convinced with their sovereign , virtuosic game and their own compositions .	-4.7714
" Here we stand , have taken the bone saws and bred a concert table with the power of a tiger " , all three groups can say at the end , however , in the transferable sense .	-6.7188

Trump blames Kim : " And then we fell in love "	-3.2564
The fact that US President North Korea ’ s rulers are well disposed toward Kim despite the nuclear crisis is no secret .	-3.7616
But Trump has now made a real declaration of love to his colleague .	-3.8640
This also has to do with kims " beautiful letters " .	-3.8737
At the tender age of 72 , the married US president has become a new flame .	-3.2910
The tragedy : it is a remote relationship .	-3.0102

Prior to West Virginia supporters , Trump found almost zärtliche Worte für den halb so alten Spross der Herrscherdynastie aus Pjöngjang , obwohl der sich im Ringen um Nordkoreas atomare Abrüstung als recht zäher Brocken erweist .	-3.9382
" I was scarce , he was also , and between us it went forth and forth , " Trump reported .	-5.3398
And then we fell in love .	-1.3752
Okay ?	-0.7372
No , really .	-1.2586
Not only did the talks with Kim have brought his heart to melt .	-3.3615
He wrote beautiful letters to me , it was great letters .	-2.9495
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit : Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim , even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service behind it .	-9.0083
That the affection for the notorious " Rocket Man " - Trump 's nickname for Kim - is not likely to be yours for everyone seemed to the US president .	-9.6656
In any case , he immediately accepted the expected criticism of his appearance in a large sports hall in Wheeling City : " Donald Trump says they have fallen in love " .	-5.5107
How terrible , how terrible is that ?	-2.2169
That is so unpresidential .	-3.3066
But he cares little about that , told Trump , and then put his finger on the crowd : " I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential " .	-6.5918
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there in this stubbornly filled arena , but we would only have 200 people out there .	-5.7528

Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey	-2.8294
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet ( CDU ) has , in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , called for the rule of law in Turkey according .	-3.5631
The two countries ' relations are currently overshadowed , " said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport .	-3.6009
This concerns , above all , waves of arrests , freedom of the press and freedom of religion .	-4.0172
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future , if economic relations are to be deepened , the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this .	-4.8790
According to his own data , Laschet also mentioned the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey .	-4.1220
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected .	-2.5863
As a result , Erdogan reiterated the independence of Turkey ’ s judiciary .	-3.8571
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was moved to a building in the short term for the airworthiness of the Federal Defence Ministry at Cologne Airport .	-6.9748
Originally it was supposed to take place at Wahn Castle - but this was rejected by the party owners out of political conviction against Erdogan .	-5.6102
Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib-Mosque in Cologne after the conversation .	-4.0274
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building .	-2.9130

Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a deal from Washington .	-3.4782
North Korea ’ s Foreign Minister , Ri Yong Ho , accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula in the UN General Debate , with its continued sanctions .	-4.2754
" The recent stalemate is that the US is building on coercive measures that are lethal to confidence-building , " said Ri in New York .	-3.9126
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances .	-2.0795
" Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security and , under such circumstances , there is no way we disarm ourselves first , " the North Korean chief diplomat said .	-4.8523
The fact that sanctions could force North Korea to " knee " is a dream of people who do not know us .	-4.9083
But to build trust , his country stopped nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility , highlighted Ri .	-4.7832
On the US side , however , there have been no ' corresponding reactions ' , the minister criticised .	-4.9573
Because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program , last year alone , the UN Security Council adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country .	-3.3372

The institution was financed by donations from the community , for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food .	-5.7833
The start with the new facility was not easy , as Henriette Westbuer , the head of the HoT , remembers .	-4.8167
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day .	-4.2038
But then , on the first day after the summer break , the bad surprise came : a power failure had overturned the huge , two-part refrigerator , which was spoiled and had to be disposed of .	-6.4960
" Now we had to start from scratch again : although we received a great deal of support from friends and neighbours , the children and young people wanted to do it alone " , says Westbuer .	-5.0308
And so they all wrapped up .	-3.1199
The result could be seen , the guests were enthusiastic .	-3.2468

Pleite at Hertha : picked up from reality : Bavaria against Ajax demanded .	-5.5529
The predicate is unbeatable : the defeat in Berlin does not want to let FC Bayern " fall .	-6.9125
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate fazit for Niko Kovac ’ s term of office .	-3.9263
The first small performance models under the new Coach Niko Kovac are not intended to increase for the Munich population at any rate to the greater .	-6.5728
" A week ago we still had the impression that we were invincible .	-4.2010
Now we got a bit of reality " , said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0 : 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions-League-Duell with Ajax Amsterdam .	-5.2063
Who knows us , who knows , knows that we are really annoyed and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday .	-6.4286
For the first time in more than a year , no gate has been shot out of its own , as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory , the spreadsheet in the Football League for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund .	-7.7704
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017 , the record master must be warned .	-4.3825
The FC Augsburg at 1 : 1 with its run-intensive Mann-gegen-Mann-Taktik and the Berliner by their playful needle stiche over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days , as the last overpowering Bavarian are to be cracked .	-12.8581
" Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don 't like this and we will do everything we can to get back to success , " said Kovac .	-6.2497
But , with his losers in his birthplace , he was surprisingly gentler , and defeated his first defeat as Munich coach only on the again flawed handling of opportunities .	-9.1593
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless be a positive step ahead of the country break - otherwise the tone will probably get worse .	-5.7717
So Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second premier class performance of this season after the 2 : 0 at Benfica Lisbon .	-5.9352
After the free day on Sunday begins as planned the short preparation for the second round against Ajax , which had also been sovereign to launch AEK Athens with 3 : 0 .	-5.9948
" Now we have caught up in two games , but we will also make our goals again " , announced national team chapter Manuel Neuer .	-5.5259
As already after the lost Cup finals against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place , Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly .	-4.6246
The legal defender appeared in the role of Mahner .	-4.8357
" I do not believe that this is all bad luck , we have to work out it again , because we do not make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes " , stressed the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic Stadium .	-6.9985
On the seventh day of the previous season the Bavarians even had five meters behind Dortmund , which has now taken the lead with one point .	-7.6330
And so , with a wink , Kimmich valued at least positively that the public debate about supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now ended .	-6.6122
" Yes , that 's already good , " said the national player .	-3.9258
For the league it is already good .	-3.3344

They have excluded them from this society because they let themselves be photographed with me in England , " Erdogan said on Saturday in the Domstadt .	-5.7140
Frankly , as its president , I could not digest it that our two young men , who have risen to the German national team , have been excluded .	-5.2463

That someone says : if I win , I am German when I lose , I am Migrant - that is not possible .	-4.2014

We should have defended Mesut more , as I have always said .	-2.6565
But he does not see a basis for Özil ’ s return to the national team .	-4.1733
In addition to the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic , who have family roots in Cameroon , an additional integration commissioner is to be appointed as a follow-up .	-5.1793
" If , without a migrant background , there is a clear impact on society and football and says : " The issue is important , we have to take care of it " , which would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration must work , " said Grindel .	-7.2749
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair , he wants to run again for the post as DFB president next year .	-5.9037
" I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes , " said Grindel .	-2.8692

Polare Kaltluft brings new snow to the west on the mountains .	-4.1830
Mrs Holle shakes her beds in the West for the first time next week : Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg , Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday .	-4.2174
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics ( ZAMG ) , the snow limit decreases to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in close valleys it could cut down to about 1,000 meters in strong intensity .	-6.7865
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern it is possible to expect between 20 and 40 centimetres of snow above 2,000 metres .	-4.8974
On higher pass roads ( Arlbergpass , Timmelsjoch , Bieler Höhe , Brennerpass , Gerlospass , Felbertauern , Großglockner Hochalpenstraße ) , road conditions are therefore wintry .	-3.7092

The " green ramparts " , unique in Germany , have shaped the landscape of the Federal Forest for some 200 years .	-5.9262
The up to five meters wide tree and rock walls are " forest replacement " and for many animals and plants the last retreats .	-6.5581
Knicks , as a corridor , scattered habitats through which the exchange of organisms can still work , as the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Society ( NABU ) in Schleswig-Holstein , Ingo Ludwichowski , said .	-5.3999
Knicks are living fences .	-0.8907
The Knicks were founded by a command of the Danish king Christian VI. in 1766 , who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein .	-4.6621
The " living fences " were not only field limiting and fencing , they also supplied firewood and beams to the farmers for their workshops .	-5.9139
From that time his name " Knick " also came from : by " reopening " the branches could develop the dense , interwoven boundaries .	-8.2051
Today , about 45 000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the picture of a large , varied and structured landscape .	-6.8899
According to the NABU , they are now used as a replacement habitat by around 7000 species .	-5.3569
In one kilometre of Knick , up to 1800 different species could live and brew up to 30 bird pairs .	-3.6195
However , the Knick can only fulfil its ecological important function if it is properly maintained in winter .	-5.6517
Otherwise , he becomes a light series of trees that , in addition to biodiversity , also loses the wind protection effect , said Ludwichowski .	-6.9914
According to the Ministry of Agriculture , the sticking service can only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March .	-5.5107
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesians talks about SItuation on site .	-3.3002
The local radica Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami in the interview with the German ( RND ) editorial network :	-4.7593
Have you been there during the tsunami ?	-3.3961
No , I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java .	-2.1564
When the earthquakes were , my wife called me , she was in Palu .	-1.7217
When I learned of the tsunami , I immediately went back to Sulawesi .	-3.1432
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport was closed on Palu at the time .	-4.2366
What is the situation on the island now ?	-1.6278
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be used .	-4.1452
When I arrived , I saw the houses on the coast , which are all completely destroyed .	-2.8528
Our office of " World Vision " is also destroyed , but we have set up something provisionally where we have also accommodated other people .	-4.9847
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now ?	-2.8896
Many are eager to see the surrounding hills , where they still endure fear of another tsunami and earthquake , and where they have no access to water and food .	-9.3438
Some people stay in front of their homes , there are still aftershocks .	-4.3897
Because many grocery stores and the petrol stations are completely closed , people are looking for some food and petrol .	-5.2129
The public service has been completely shut down , and the national government is helping .	-3.2449
A prison has also been destroyed , the prisoners are partly free and the search for them is difficult .	-3.6606
There are still many corpses around , many people have not been found and are missing .	-6.1434
How does communication and information on the island run ?	-3.3972
At the moment we have Handyempfang , but before that it did not work and we only got information over the radio .	-5.6850
Many people are still looking for their children , neighbours and other people , from whom they do not know whether they live and where they are , because people were not at home during the earthquakes , but , for example , on work .	-5.5516
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly .	-1.8247
Do you have any information about this ?	-1.9453
We do not know the reasons for this , but when the warning came , many thought " okay , no tsunami " - and then he came .	-3.6842
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami , there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they are known to the surrounding mountains .	-4.0171
Is an island like Sulawesi , located on the Pacific Firering , not prepared for earthquakes ?	-2.7137
But , there are earthquakes every day , but this was the worst .	-2.6312
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuation .	-2.3293
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed , and the earthquake has hit many people .	-3.2736
Muscle injuries against Werder : VfB must waive Aogo and Donis for a long time .	-3.3651

At Donis , doctors diagnosed a muscle strap in the thighs .	-4.5012
Both players are definitely not an option against Hanover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss the game after the following country break .	-7.2851
The VfB Stuttgart did not give up a forecast of the downtime .	-4.2362
A muscle bundle crack usually heals within six to eight weeks , a muscle fibre crane usually heals a little faster .	-5.4013

With a rescue boat , the fire brigade could encircle the animal and push it back to the country , where it was then put into a transport box by a fireman after almost an hour with a brave handle .	-7.5617
The duck injured at the breast was then brought to the LMU 's pet clinic to Oberschleißheim .	-5.0239
But , after the first assessments , their chances of survival are rather small .	-4.0215

A medal was the goal , I was in top shape , but it simply did not want to be .	-3.3723
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missing precious metals in the new season : " The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution .	-6.7111
Sometime you have to complain .	-4.3705
The WM-Loipe in Östersund ( SWE ) is Eberhard : " The track I 've already closed into my heart " , he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup race in the single race last year .	-11.0811

Brett Kavanaugh : FBI investigation in Turbotempo	-1.7674
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited .	-3.1419
With a FBI investigation in the Turbotempo , the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the haughty majority for the judge candidate , Brett Kavanaugh , who has been contested for allegations of nullity .	-7.8703
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline of Friday to clarify the alleged incidents over 30 years ago .	-4.5139
The recent turn in the drama surrounding the occupation of Kavanaugh , accompanied by a cultural struggle , was triggered on on Friday .	-4.6080
Following an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor , Christine Blasey Ford , during which the lawyer ’ s angry tirade opposed opposition democrats , the Senate ’ s Justice Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the Supreme US Supreme Court ’ s arch-conservative judge .	-7.9417
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared , contrary to his initial announcement , that he would agree , but demand a FBI investigation .	-4.2971
After tumultuous scenes , his party friends agreed .	-3.4521
President Trump , who had described Thursday 's serious conversations as a ' Commissioner ' , initially contained further attacks against women and , on the contrary , spoke of ' happiness in the accident ' .	-6.9888
In this way , last doubt could be resolved , he said .	-3.8819
Later , in an election rally , Trump rallied the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh : " They try to block and destroy " .	-4.8911
Trump orders FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case	-5.3496
The White House also has extremely limited the powers of investigators .	-3.2427
One will specifically investigate the known accusations of two women , not more , said a government representative to the " Wall Street Journal " : " They do not go on a fishing trip " .	-6.3655

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz : The fear has been felt .	-3.7617
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz .	-2.0410
The relief on Schalke is large after the first season victory .	-3.8737
However , against Mainz , time also played a role .	-4.1332
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches .	-3.8721
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05 .	-2.9600
" I 've seen every ball inside .	-4.3395
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room , " said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathe .	-3.2752
After all , the king ’ s blue was still able to bring the scarce 1 : 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first season victory under the roof .	-7.5503
In fact , this could have happened differently .	-3.8786
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of chief coach Domenico Tedesco security had given Tedesco : " In sum , the first half was good , both playfully and from the pressing her " , with increasing the head .	-7.0539
Really no headball-monster	-4.2425
" The last ten minutes have felt like two hours " , Heidel said : " If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bank , I can understand this " .	-4.0190
The guys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore moved on .	-6.3117
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz .	-2.3088
To save the first three meters of the season .	-1.7258
" We all liked a huge stone from the heart , " said Schöpf , who had no important part with his headball-match : " I am actually the worst headballer player in the team " .	-7.6715
But in the end , only victory counts .	-2.9612
The relief was felt throughout the arena , including , of course , Tedesco .	-4.5346
" We wanted to start in the early stages and make a firework out of it " , said Schalke 's chief coach .	-5.4079
The victory was important .	-1.3937
Finally we can look forward to a couple of hours .	-3.6810
I am very , very happy for the team and the fans .	-1.6232
We have played intelligently , quietly and courageously , so we have to tackle lots over 90 minutes .	-4.2985
Perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon : Royal blue missed it to worry more about clearer conditions .	-5.3901
The possibilities were finally there , for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka , who twice met the Latte 59th / 72 or Amine Harit 62 .	-4.9173
" Then it would not have become a quote victory " , Tedesco said : " You have felt the fear a bit " .	-5.4536
I am therefore pleased that we have won .	-2.0378
He was not the only Schalker .	-3.4563
Fischbachau : Smoking column visible in the Leitzachtal 2 km .	-8.0503
The noise was not overlooked .	-3.4825

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration : A discussion on equal terms .	-2.9624
Before them is the author , Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani .	-2.3128
He has again followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild .	-3.1211
" I have made it my job to bring interesting people to Greven for many years , " explains the founder and chairman of the " Reckenfelder Treffs " - that association which cooperates with the " Kulturpolitik " alliance in the evening .	-6.0459
El-Mafaalani rises very loosely in the reading , describes the writing process of the book , talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject intelligently .	-6.8272
With a lot of gestures , solid figures and one or two jokes , he brings one of the most conflicting themes closer to listeners : migration and integration .	-5.5036
Why , despite successful integration , are there increasing conflicts ?	-3.7409
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question .	-3.2602
At one table , German society , at the cat table , sits the first generation migrants .	-4.1577
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table .	-2.9813
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany , they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate .	-4.3282
That leads to conflict .	-1.4968
It is not , therefore , crucial whether one is politically right or left-wing , but : ' Do I stand for or against an open society ? ' , he stresses .	-7.3805
Initially rather behave , then the discussion round is always going on .	-6.6572
And there is a need for speech .	-2.4083
From his perspective , an Afghan refugee tells two teachers how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students .	-4.0791
El-Mafaalani is standing , not on stage , a symbol of the discussion : she is on an equal footing .	-4.6635
The sociology professor does not push his mind , emphasizes that he speaks of the average , not of individual fates .	-4.3128
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject , because ' only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions ' , says El-Mafaalani .	-3.5843
During the ensuing signing session , he was still open to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer , during prepared Kurdish specialities , and discussed intensively .	-8.4109

The mayor Roland Frick shares this .	-8.4681
In addition , the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality on more favourable conditions or prices is completed , similar to the previous one .	-7.6790

According to the Plieninger mayor , the aim is to have the candidates ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council .	-6.2407
Subsequently , the allocation could take place .	-3.8762
In total , 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the area in the south of Landsham , as well as four plots for multi-family houses with probably eight residential units each .	-6.7676
The development is now almost complete , the roads and roads are to be paved in the near future .	-5.2622
A single plot as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person , the rest of the municipality of Pliening .	-4.8504

The opening is scheduled for September 2019 , at the start of the next nursery year .	-3.8125
In this way , Schalkes Naldo " big sport " also succeeds on the bank .	-5.6929
For the third time in a row , Naldo thanked Domenico Tedesco , a Schalke coach .	-5.7702
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat for the third time in succession not in the Schalker Startelf , but on the exchange-rate , understanding among many people would have been great if the almost two meters big Brazilian had rightly spoken the frustration of the soul .	-6.9952
But when the Schalker players gathered after the 1 : 0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle and chief coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals , the 36-year-old , who call all the simplest half of Naldo , turned up and said ; " We have to thank trainers ! "	-14.0444
" This was very emotional , that was great sport , " Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain , who , despite his renewed reserve existence , did not have any resentment .	-7.8658
Problích knows Naldo , who was celebrated as the best songwriter in the past season , that he has not , in fact , been sidelined by his coach - but has been given a break for good reasons .	-8.9073
One reason called " load control " .	-2.5669
It was not easy to tell him that .	-1.7494
" It was not easy to tell him this , I tell you quite honestly , " Tedesco reported from the moment when he told Naldo that he was not in the starting eleven .	-5.0590
He is an important player , he is an important person .	-2.0979
But it is always about the thing , it is about the association " , founded Tedesco the step .	-4.9628
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bavaria and Porto .	-1.3774
It is 36 years old .	-1.0778
It is important that at the moment everyone can sneak through . , , , , , , , , , . , ,	-7.3750
And that we all keep in the boat , " Tedesco explained the rotation , which last also caught Naldo .	-3.6476
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age : also by acting as an exemplary team player on the bank .	-5.8715
In August , the mood in Austria ’ s industry continued to accelerate its decline relative to the eurozone .	-4.2534
The PMI Shopping Manager Index was 46.7 points on a 37-month low .	-5.3899
Despite this , Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands , the Markit Institute announced on Monday its survey of 3,000 companies .	-5.9007
Unlike Austria , the euro zone ’ s PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 , yet the index is still below the 50 counter mark for the 13th month consecutive .	-6.3267

A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight : export orders in the eurozone have fallen as much as they have since November 2011 .	-4.5882
The companies therefore completed the seventh month in succession .	-7.0532
In China , too , industrial production fell stronger than initially thought in August .	-7.0174
The voting barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points .	-1.8889
