The historical maps of the Bavarian Atlas digital Bayern-Atlas , an offer of the Geoportals of the State Government , are far from the moment - but it is very revealing .	-6.6333
Especially if you compare them with current online maps .	-2.4439
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the region of the Munich-based Merkur have changed since the 19th century .	-4.9739
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be recognized as such .	-3.6414
The large overview map has been used for cities and municipalities of more detailed maps , so-called opposition sheets .	-6.7467
This was due to the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and was the first surveying of Bayerns .	-5.3190
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.0178
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalitions War with Austria .	-3.7514
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical recording of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes .	-4.6539
Even if French troops were finally withdrawn with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 : it was today 's neighbours who created the idea of a universal Bayern-Karte .	-6.4259
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project , founded the " Topographische Bureau " - and thus the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung .	-5.6448
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .	-4.8508
Compared to the former / Today , the state capital is the most impressive .	-8.2001
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.0359
An example of this is subsendling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-4.5839
Sendling was 21 years after the creation of the card , i.e. 1877 , when Munich district was established .	-7.5591
Today , Untersendling is located in the heart of the city .	-3.5174
The houses Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today ’ s Plinganserstraße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser , a leader of the insurrection of Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705 .	-4.8771
Where the West Park is today , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : when you zoom in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten corridors from the so-called " Uraufnahme " , which was derived from the base tax .	-9.7196
Small parcels are no longer farmers here today - but small gardeners of the ' land in sun ' .	-5.9682
A large green area is north of Untersendling .	-2.4669

Citizens ' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-4.0820
The National Association to promote color color has issued a warning for colorful people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State to Missouri .	-4.9731
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri , which will enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for African-American travelers , visitors and Missourians to travel through the state , and to take extreme caution , since a series of dubious race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state , and this is stated in the opinion of the group .	-10.1695
A recent law of Missouri , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that disproportionately targeted minorities , led the group said NAACP .	-6.3478
" They have violations of civil rights that people pass .	-3.9641
They are beaten or killed because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-4.0174
" We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard . "	-2.8290
It is the first such warning that the organization issued to a state in the US .	-3.5824
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-1.9095
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline and was taken by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of being accused .	-9.6635
The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General Public Prosecutor of Missouri , which shows that black drivers will be kept 75 % more frequently than white .	-5.4065
" The recommendation is that people are aware of and their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri said Chapel .	-3.3078
" People must be prepared to know whether there is money or leave the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-6.2788
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI report , which classifies the state in terms of the number of such breaches to the country ’ s 16th rank .	-6.6610
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-6.7551
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , having adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigrant offences , which , in the opinion of ACLU will contribute to further racial profiling .	-5.7483
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently lobbies have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-4.0630
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary .	-1.3644
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.5020
The CDU parliament , Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on the ground .	-5.0305
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-placards together with mayors Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-5.2530
Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into its operation , in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , as well as many young animals and five apartments holiday guests . , , , .	-7.3189
The " Black Forest milk " is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwendemann .	-4.7690
On the table of the holiday guests is exclusively regional .	-3.6462
Since he is also known as BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach , he described the Weidezaunprojekt as " elementar important " .	-4.2842
I cannot run into such steep areas .	-4.3877
Green land care for a lot of work , much needs to be done with the engine sense .	-5.1215
" We are dealing with the conditions and with topography " , emphasized Schwendemann .	-4.2933
In 2003 he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead to a bio-operation .	-6.4933
For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : " The Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunproject project and is glad about the Leader-promoting " .	-6.3071
At the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .	-3.7736
It is hoped that the reforestation of land could still be extended .	-5.8121
" The biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operation " , stressed the mayor .	-5.8074
Farmers are often criticised for promoting criticism .	-2.7737
In 2013 , 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced .	-3.7045
The open area is 40 hectares , which must not be explored until at least 2023 .	-5.7478
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half over Leader , a quarter of the municipality of Fischerbach .	-4.5079
Thus , farmers spend 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of Weidezaun .	-4.1444
" The great advantage is the longevity of the fences " , explained Schwendemann .	-2.7574
Kordula Kovac emphasized : " She does a good job , without farmers and rural women are not ' .	-5.4827
For Peter Weiß stand firm : " Here the best food is produced " .	-4.3401
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg allows state support for Weidezäunen .	-3.8881
The aim is to open the Black Forest .	-2.6793
The precondition is the existence of a conveyor by the LPR .	-5.8148
In addition , the area must not be tradable ( hemisphere over 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-6.2193
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the request of eight participants with 24 parcels , which would like to build up just 16 kilometres of fence .	-6.4267
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-5.4586
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.1438
Now the White House of Trump ’ s Freedom Statue	-4.1584
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues .	-2.9472
The Americans appreciate them as well as any other , so carefully staged overthrow Saddam Hussein ’ s place in Baghdad in 2003 .	-11.5346
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , knew what he did when he did a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President ’ s proposals to drastic restrictions on legal immigration .	-4.2688
To stay fair , Miller did not use the statue itself .	-2.7279
A horde of boat owners and liberty-beekeepers would have lied him if he had done it .	-4.0994
But he attacked their meaning , and in particular the importance that was attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the memor.	-6.3708
When Miller Acosta , " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the statue is a symbol of American freedom that the world enlightened .	-6.2497
The poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original freedom statue . '	-4.6843
Miller is correct , but as he himself said , it is not really about history .	-3.9752
It is about contemporary resonance on the winding words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not just invite any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mosquito , your poor , / your poor , / your crowded masses , who yearn to breathe , / elding waste of your rich coasts . '	-9.0707
There was never a time when the " elende waste " on our screens .	-2.8350
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-3.4419
This conflict because of the importance of statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-3.8057
Lazarus - and their friends who set themselves to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they carried out a highly political act .	-5.2490
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by showing them in a well-used classic visual depiction of freedom .	-6.7569
Lazarus changed this meaning : In her poem , female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice .	-2.9295
And she gives herself another name : mother of the exiles .	-3.4352
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism .	-2.8420
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of statue , people wanted to change from the right wing .	-4.2041
The great horror as Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John of the Baptist for coming from Trump , argued in 2010 that the statue is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservatives that the American flame into the world : " Lady Liberty is progressing .	-6.4192
It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.8987
The torch is not supposed to go down the road to the United States . '	-4.8544
Limbaugh is usually unusual .	-5.6403
The importance of statue is completely and even a question of the position of perception .	-3.9856
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were by the exhausted , elding , but hopeful people after long and often dreadful travel on the deck of ships .	-5.5566
It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-4.3631
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of goodwill they have to hear .	-3.8951
And that is , of course , not the prospect that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge .	-3.9341
Their torch is not to enlighten , but hatred , who is their only source of power .	-5.0358
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black lobt Scottish members of the UK team .	-3.0826
Eilidh Doyle reminds of a time when only two Scots were part of Britain ’ s team .	-3.1861
The UK ’ s performance director of athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-4.8384
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.3677
Black believes that " developing something special in Scotland " and the lightweight athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something .	-5.5985
" We welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find it out , ' said Black .	-2.9613
" I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.8645
The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.0890
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-1.7957
And also with the type of street corner .	-3.0974
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . "	-1.8542
Several of the Scottish athletes are Medaillen-Anwarmter , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who are against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain .	-6.0309
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.3514
Her captain speech was incredible " , says Black .	-2.6132
" A series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-4.3182
The passion and the real feeling that the Eilidh was very natural .	-5.9696
The Commonwealth silver medals , who are in their fifth World Championships at the 400-m-Hürden , says that it is " unbelievable " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-6.2120
Scotland has been the best total number of athletes in the World Cup in 1983 and 2015 .	-4.3704
The medium-haul rider Muir leads on this road and has established five British and two European records last year .	-5.7363
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners .	-3.2006
Chris O 'Hare , who is running 1,500 m , is another Scot , who was looking for a great season that followed the victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games .	-7.7032
Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championships , when the only other Scots in Team Lee McConnell .	-4.3029
Mannschafts-Kapitänin says that they are " enormously proud " of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with medals and finals .	-6.4101
" The special feature of Team-Kapitänin is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was always a great honour , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me , makes it something very special for me " , added it .	-7.7052
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-1.9583
It shows just how far we have come .	-2.2172
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podiums .	-2.7744
As regards my speech as captain ?	-1.9723
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.4973
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home World Cup .	-3.9749
It is therefore really important to put this home support and benefit from the fact that we are again in the Olympiastadion .	-3.9173
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will simply be a great atmosphere outside . '	-4.9977
Blocking critics on Facebook : Do not worry about a public office if you don ’ t have a public office if you don ’ t have to sign up for voters ’ approval .	-9.0281
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-2.1900
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not long until the newspapers took him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .	-5.7328
He shifted in criticism , safe .	-4.8584
But he did not silence his critics .	-1.3645
For in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupid and stupid , we shall be waged as sheep . '	-5.6440
This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.6557
Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .	-4.1515
That is why the American Civil Liberties Union dismissed him early this week .	-4.7441
The staff of the governor left the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.9177
" It is only Facebook " , said many people .	-1.7628
But it is important .	-0.6361
And it is particularly important if it is a type like hogan .	-2.6062
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing popular .	-2.7011
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.7030
Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzkopf .	-1.7049
He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to the principles .	-3.7361
He was also very cleverly to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debut his haarless head to chemotherapy on his side .	-5.6629
That is why blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is called officially and is paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-7.3392
In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse , the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-4.4837
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hatched people online .	-3.1179
The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-2.4136
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a parish , no troll .	-3.5658
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profane .	-2.3770
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans ’ Catholic faith .	-2.9261
Lashmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hasserly filled , but she asked for hate crimes .	-3.4430
" I commented courteous that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary area of the news post " The Post " .	-4.8139
" I do not value this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they will be disregarded by some rather rather than a large group of citizens affected ' .	-6.2500
What the employees of the governor called " concentrated spam attack " , others would probably call " advocacy " .	-5.8512
The Facebook-era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or a negative comment .	-3.6389
It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and arrest newspapers with critical guideline or to silence protesters and silence protesters .	-7.0740
But that is exactly what is happening in digital .	-3.5350
Hogan is not the first public officials criticized for having Facebook and other social media .	-3.3103
President Trump is scaled by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .	-3.1910
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia .	-1.7173
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment , according to US District judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when she appointed a facebooks page .	-5.2375
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.4636
That should not be so difficult .	-1.6513
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet .	-3.6073
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymously letters sworn on his leadership .	-4.5995
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.7801
The people who used pseudonyme like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " , wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .	-3.3023
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty , trade and shipping with Britain , were overwhelmed by the George Washington Project Online Papers .	-5.4168
But he did not silence them .	-2.0648
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourses are part of our nation .	-2.4387
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.6103

" These were two counterparts too much , and we need to be careful in Aue even better , " says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.4612
In the Erzgebirge , the triangle should also be further optimized .	-4.2136
And a gateway after a release , the Fortunes will no longer be imagined .	-7.4393
" For the future , it will be so that no one will stand alongside Michael ( Rensing ) .	-5.5913

" I do not know how we will act in Aue , " says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure that " because we are just in the triangle on the semiposts in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well build " , said Hoffmann .	-6.6096

New results from the Swedish Asylum Recent Test	-4.0332
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the tested persons are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-5.0397
The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine ( Councils ) has started the tests last year .	-4.9759
During the asylum procedure , they should make an assessment of the age of some refugees after the Swedish migration authority ( migratory verket ) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were less years .	-13.0342
Up to now , migration has sent 6.880 cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-4.8121
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were considered 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person " may be 18 years or older " .	-4.0182
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years old .	-2.6350
The tests are carried out only in cases where the person 's age is called into question .	-2.8352
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-3.4093
" We do not see a big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said the magazine The Local . . , . . , . . . . . . .	-6.7843
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied over their age .	-8.0797
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that " proposed that the person investigated was 18 years or older " .	-4.5288
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published , she found that in 243 of these cases the person openly said that she would be 18 years old .	-4.6673
The method of medical age assessment , in which X-ray measurements of Weisheitszähnen and MRT recordings of knees , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-7.1061
A skeptic is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska-Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they were sooner or later than usual by puberty .	-5.4359
" I had reason to think about this , and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.8594
The biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.5118
If we cannot safely say it , we should not pretend that we should not pretend that .	-5.1703
However , Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : " In general you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is incorrect .	-3.5910
The biggest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 % . '	-5.1981

How could the scandal happen ?	-1.1656
How can consumers protect themselves .	-0.7324
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is an interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.2577
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-2.2835
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .	-3.6877
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information about the Eier-Chargen concerned .	-4.5685
Those affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-2.9389
Even if , after all , what we are now aware , there is a health hazard is practically excluded .	-5.5776
Aldi is now taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the educator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?	-6.0000
Food surveillance is the task of the federal countries .	-3.0717
Nevertheless , my house has been swinged and has been in close cooperation with the authorities of the countries concerned .	-7.5097
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.6680
Trade has , just as manufacturers , to ensure that the products sold are safe and healthy .	-6.6325
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded , these are not accessible .	-4.4997
Uncontaminated eggs can be sold and consumed .	-2.6731
This time is not the fault of farms .	-3.0526
Seat production plants and consumers on the same boat ?	-2.9983
According to current knowledge , production companies do not directly blame .	-4.2984
Instead , they must expect economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies .	-3.9456
As always , there is too little inspectors in the event of serious cases .	-4.9398
Is it not only the staff or the consistent competence ?	-7.2279
It was precisely the official controls that have revealed the process .	-4.8796
The truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 % .	-3.0725
It is precisely for this reason that we need a consistent clarification of such events and the transfer of public prosecutors in cases where offences can be found .	-8.1925
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the competent authorities to have a full enlightenment . .	-4.1899
Is the regular alarm in food scandals really necessary ?	-3.0466
Consumers have the right to obtain safe and viable food .	-3.9541
If an insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-3.3631
The proposed means that manufacturers , dealers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .	-5.5407
In principle , it must be clear : the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of food suppliers is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-5.9156
This must be consistent and working on all levels .	-5.2040
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the situation is speedily and unresolved .	-5.5267
How the financial rules of the Football affect Neymars move to Paris ?	-4.6740
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars ’ World Record Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-4.1029
Somewhat consequences will be for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA , because the leading organisation that monitored the European game has monitored the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champions-League tournament .	-6.1760
Financial fair play rules that were launched in 2011 by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without large losses .	-4.9267
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several ten million dollars per year .	-4.6314
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France .	-1.8965
PSG can certainly make the money loosely so that Neymar is signing and bringing it into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the wealthy ruler family of Qatar .	-5.9867
clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must be subject to legitimate revenue sources that enable them to break the Break-Even point in their football .	-6.8188
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.6252
Former French player believed that clubs who had taken huge debts in their pursuit of success , were effectively cheated and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-5.9638
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .	-3.7165
The change meant that the business model , the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter .	-4.8359
During the current three-year FFP publishing period , which runs up to 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .	-3.2967
And , while Platini ’ s presidency fell into disgrace in 2015 , his UEFA ’ s successor Aleksander Ceferin continued to deter excessive spending .	-4.8129
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP , compared to The Associated Press last week .	-7.5733
Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum , it can distribute the amount for the billing over the duration of its contract .	-4.9279
Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the proceeds can be expelled for the next five years to the tune of EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts .	-6.2009
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the PSG , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .	-3.2883
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions-League season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of normal 25 players .	-5.6848
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by making their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .	-5.5896
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not be considered legitimate income .	-4.6140
That was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship of the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-3.7069
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar about payments from the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .	-7.8094
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar WMambassadors will be easy to find out that Neymar WM ambassadors will simply find out .	-5.8886
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.1771
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer , told the people who are familiar with the situation .	-7.0526
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.0865
The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros a profit of more than EUR 10 million .	-4.0023
The accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .	-2.2038
PSG expects Neymars to be a blessing for sponsoring Deals , Merchandising and Trikotsales .	-4.0540
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-3.6108
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.1930
" It is a clear case of ' financial doping ' with the club and the state , " said the President of the La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily newspaper AS regarding Qatar 's eventual ownership of PSG .	-4.8560
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports team , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club .	-3.8425
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.8616
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.1815

This repetition of history is nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 1980s , for the 90-year Grunge era ( when David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch-Komöden " The State " for MTV turned ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd .	-5.3029
As a cultural artifact , it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-3.1375
But as a franchise feels it as if the time was short .	-4.5665

It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillons Unterlippenbart of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old boy .	-4.7096
It is the moments of random madness that this Franchise could fuel like a kind of repeated " Seven Up !

Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , created comedy with Rhys Thomas as director , is a filmed TV series : a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest who for truth , atheism , and the path of Marxismus-Leninism .	-6.4306
The main roles - a hard-pressed Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues of Channing Tatum ( also an executable producer ) and Joseph Gordon Levitt .	-4.0453
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.3285

There are some beautiful gags to the image ( the police spends the time to watch Chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-9.2370
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game ' Find the voice .	-2.7917
But " Comrade Detective " is so much committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan-mask , is involved - that it often plays like one .	-6.2876
In six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-4.6215
" Comrade Detective " , which was applied to a smaller length , could provide its Agitprop-Satire better , since Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who squeezed a bunch of Hamburg .	-7.6082

Slap on Drug Mafia in the Land	-4.5390
The police was a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-2.8344
On Wednesday morning , the Schwarzwald-Baar circle , Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart received numerous objects such as the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office of Konstanz on Friday .	-5.5304
15 accused of suspects were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and have already been issued against them .	-6.6532
In addition , officials ensured larger quantities of Marihuana and cocaine , firearms and several hundred thousand euros were safe .	-4.7952
Two people were arrested in Italy at the same time .	-3.5784
There was a German arrest warrant against the two suspects Italians .	-2.6687
The two are likely to be delivered to Germany .	-2.8988
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.4369
More than 300 police officers were deployed .	-2.3220
The members of the Mafia is accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder and robbery and blackmail .	-4.8850
Since the summer of 2016 , the prosecutor ’ s Office of Constance against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-5.0536
Between prosecutors in Constance and Palermo , there was a reger exchange and investigators of Cripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .	-4.7076
That is why the large-scale deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .	-5.2751
Ins Visier of the investigations were mainly Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian mafia .	-6.1588

In a way , large gaps in the foreign register register .	-7.5835
'Data of citizens who should not appear ' : according to a report , according to a report , the external register in Germany has serious shortcomings .	-7.1370
This leads to some serious misdecisions on asylum procedures .	-3.7196
According to a media report , the Federal Government ’ s refugee management , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to major gaps in the country ’ s central register .	-5.8425
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to serious misjudgments in asylum procedures and deportations ' to some extent serious misdecisions ' , in an analysis that has been made by the Southern German newspaper .	-8.6847
According to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.6688
The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.1270
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality has not been good in parts .	-3.8597
In individual cases , data of 1921 have been found , " by people who have long been no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register ' .	-8.0697
" Error data input can significantly slow return processes , " says the report continues .	-5.9560
The statistics on emigration people are also covered by EU citizens who do not have to travel .	-6.8746
However , such false allocations led to a distorted debate on the handling of exit ' , it is therefore said in the analysis .	-7.3242
Meanwhile , the Federal Government seems to have begun to send refugee families with 16 years old children to Italy when they entered .	-6.6682

Preexpositionsprophylaxe ( PrEP ) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-4.0749
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious risk .	-4.6929

We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.8077
Ian Green , CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country , and that nobody who has a risk to HIV has left .	-5.2149
Now that the PrEP-Testmedizin has been established , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . '	-7.4351
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Health Minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government .	-3.7389
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.5008
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-3.1627
It is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help us to bring about a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society .	-4.8190
The great life live : the intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-4.9077
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced herself from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment .	-3.3320
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-3.1060
" Davor I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room " , says Joanne .	-2.2212
" I searched for something that was comparable to my price .	-2.9811
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.8571
I have been in love and made an offer on this day . '	-4.4107
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overtaken .	-3.7401
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to reach the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauraum and an intermediate floor to make the most generous ceilings .	-7.0050
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.7743
That was my request , " she says .	-3.0947
To this end , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill , which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and creating a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne .	-5.0664
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand .	-4.2742
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-8.4049
" The steel mill is quite complicated , " he explains .	-3.2645
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were sewn together without having to bundle .	-5.5650
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but to put steel in such a way that it had the right height . " " " " " " .	-5.6583
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .	-4.2270
For the intermediate floor , a classic copper light window of Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area .	-4.9479
Blended gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.7801
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.9766
On both ends , a short corridor is mirrored to allow him to work longer .	-4.7838
In the kitchen , mirror is like a window in another room .	-4.9492
At the entrance there are divided units for all cuttings and glasses of Joanne .	-5.3147
By exercising a glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.9165
Closable kitchens are nothing new .	-3.0553
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door door .	-2.9328
" A bit of engineering went there " , explains Erfan of the stahlverstärkten , furnierten MDF door .	-3.6490
" It is counterproductive , so it is very easy to slip the door . "	-5.3763
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.1169
" At the end of the day you will sell the land - or as your property is estimated " , says Erfan .	-3.3451
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate broker will enter a calculation based on the soil size . "	-4.2475
Here they managed to enlarge the floor and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.8820
" The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home " , says Erfan .	-2.7317
" You do not fall into the electric plug in the walls .	-3.8793
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.3447
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square metre number of somewhat standard into something quite astonishing .	-5.6609
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave it .	-2.3853
Brothers are fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire .	-3.4970
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a dispute over one of the biggest real estate empire Victorias worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.5624
The former director of the ' Carlton -Football-club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets should be shared .	-5.5516
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-4.1411
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers had 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood .	-3.8574
The Westco family founded Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.4745
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.6835
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento apartments , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the city .	-8.1420
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - by Paul as the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company 's assets and Paul about one-third .	-5.7444
A court act says that this means that Colin property is worth $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-3.5514
The division of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-3.7132
" The departments proposed by Colin proposed departments have left him with what I thought for the best objects " , he wrote in 2015 in a first monstrous .	-3.7450
Last Friday , after several failed mediations took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court .	-2.8355
The brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled out .	-5.1403
Colin argues that this is not true , but it accuses Paul to administer some of incompetent .	-4.3140
In an early Affidavit that was tabled by Colin , he says he hope to settle the dispute .	-4.0584
" My Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.7437
The costs are rising , with hundreds of pages with monkeys , e-mails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and from both sides .	-4.4439
Mrs De Lutis and her hideous husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought milk bars and delicatesses from the late 1950s , and in the early 1970s . , , . . .	-8.1472
They used the security to buy Collingwood in the first jeans of the family .	-4.9125
Colin says that he began when he started " in my last years of the High School when Paul was a small child ( about 10 years old ) . " " " " .	-5.0266
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to their sons .	-2.8877
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brethren before court " , she wrote .	-2.7147
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Luke Group , claiming that Mark was leaving the company $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars .	-4.6151
Both Lukas and Mark are said , Paul " said about the conditions of their financial separation " .	-4.5262
Colin has withheld a very long time , even though he was a former AFL member of the Board of Directors and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire .	-7.6951
Fairfax Media met Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-2.5387
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I really cannot say much ' because the case is before the courts .	-3.6512
" It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and put our family names through the courts " , he wrote .	-4.1373
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands .	-2.5282
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , " he said and added that he would " still hope for a solution " .	-4.5869
On Friday , this hope seemed to be over .	-2.7630
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.5300
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media .	-6.5396
Others have tried and failed .	-1.0672
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .	-1.4720
If so , he will be the first .	-1.2372
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the head on a more equal course .	-5.3762
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.9868
" When John F. Kelly , the new White House of Staff , met a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , on his first working day with senior officials , he was a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House who wanted to repair bad information that he wanted to repair .	-7.0333
Kelly said to the staff that information should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . '	-4.7872
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tell Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-2.8808
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades - and now when he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.0902
" If Trump ’ s candidacy for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of posts that were persuaded , " former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said in February .	-5.9076
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keep Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media account contains a constant praise . "	-4.6776
Okay .	-0.4080
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit was ever under control is ridiculous .	-1.5701
Perhaps this campaign officials know something that we do not know – that Trump ’ s tweets would not have included more fuel without their intervention .	-5.3435
We will probably never learn about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.5165
If he has managed to keep his colleagues away from him several times , their efforts have been rewarded .	-6.7093
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from provoking controversy .	-2.2484
Part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are constantly trying to move forward their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.8454
Politico - quite deals with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to the President for strategic reasons .	-5.2052
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.9526
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano can respond to negative press cuts , especially those with embarrassing leaks , and that he understands how they come from .	-6.5108
That is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the President malicious a printed copy of a article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocation Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief Staff of Staff Katie Walsh , " the source behind a bunch of leaks " in the White House .	-7.8893
Although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence , or that he has voiced false accusations and has revoked them in the past . .	-6.3714
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh . "	-2.9991
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , " have tried to implement a system to manage and document the Trump receives ' .	-3.9621
How did this clone ?	-2.2753
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-1.5788
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulse Self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-3.4940
These unchangeable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.5776

Travellers are negotiating a grave and return to the ' Millionaire series ' series ' ' .	-5.1012
Some of the wealthiest landowners of the West Midlands have once again negotiated with some determined travellers on war , who have negotiated a field before their mansions .	-7.9851
Travellers have their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull , called the " Millionärs series " .	-5.3447
They have brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May , without having been deterred by the Council in order to prevent their incidents .	-6.2626
The tactical group found a gap in defence systems and pushed their vehicles through a section which remained unhindered to find a way .	-5.2161
Dear residents have pushed the Council of Solihull , who said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.0817
An anonymous resident said : " They went there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley Heath , where they had thrown stones on the passers-by .	-5.8917
The Council must indeed be forced to implement , as it was useless when dealing with the problem .	-4.7984
The travellers were moved there in May , and are now back again .	-3.9163
More came yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-3.4375
It added : ' The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect their parks .	-4.8257
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common tax if the Council cannot even stop this . '	-2.8901

The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . '	-5.9026
A spokesperson in the Council of Solihull said : " We are an unauthorized warehouse on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls .	-5.1494
To support our collection , it is very important that as many people as possible to register anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .	-4.4394
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . '	-3.7417

The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.8300
These are good news for the city .	-1.3837
Because with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH was lost on 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights per year and also revenue from the Kurtaxe .	-7.0083
In the autumn of 2014 , with a dramatic increase in the numbers of refugees arriving in the county office , the hotel building was offered as a collection of controversial discussions .	-8.6578
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.4543
The decision was not uncontroversial at that time .	-3.1480
But , above all Freudenstadt Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald , defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interest at that time .	-5.5135
It should be right .	-1.5308
The Luisenhotels Group , with a business leader Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-6.8659

Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.1322
The Hotel Luise , Luise Park , Luise Park , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-2.9192
At the former Hotel Birkenhof , there has been a construction store for some time now and when you enter the house , it is clear how extensive renovation work is carried out .	-8.8988
The floors were removed , partially removed old bathtubs from the rooms .	-5.4984
The entire hotel building is a single building site .	-2.7924
There is still much to be done by March .	-2.1478

They do not want to be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad , but at an elevated inner city level .	-6.5197
The Waldhotel Luise with about 60 rooms , explains Scherer .	-4.5480
Both individual tourists , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .	-5.2278

Russia affair : US Special Mediator sets Grand Jury a Grand Jury .	-6.0224
In the Russland-affair around US President Donald Trump , special mediator Robert Mueller , a so-called Grand Jury .	-6.4428
In recent weeks , the board has begun work , the Wall Street Journal wrote under appeal to people familiar with the matter .	-7.1895
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified its investigations .	-3.3967
The sender CNN reported that there was already first invitations from the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-4.8024
US intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time in 2016 presidential campaign .	-3.7375
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.7835
The investigation is intended to focus several men who acted in the election campaign as a Republican advisor .	-6.3773
According to reports , Mueller also took more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.1969
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Mediator Trump personally put the spotlight on whether the president might have hampered the judiciary .	-6.1546
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether charges should be levied .	-5.6161
The Grand Jurys are therefore also referred to charges .	-4.0218
Most of them are switched on when they are larger and controversial cases .	-4.9217
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .	-1.6637
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor 's Office in order to invite people to join the European Union .	-7.9366
According to the CNN , submissions have already been issued , which revolve around Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-5.3478
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to say that the report was called upon .	-5.0355
They should also provide documents .	-1.3498
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s adviser and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and his damalier election campaign leader Paul Manafort .	-5.2606
Legal experts said on Thursday evening that Mueller will show that Mueller will not be intimidated in his work and that , if necessary , he wants to act quickly .	-5.7344
However , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end in order to decide on a charge .	-4.9069
Nevertheless , the establishment of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-4.2098
In the midst of the new revelations , President on Thursday evening , a speech in West Virginia , used to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-4.4885
" Russia history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-2.6328
The issue gives democrats a chance to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about .	-4.4435
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.9794
However , they usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-4.8286
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the special intermediary .	-4.5348
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not determined against the president .	-3.6168
There is no reason to believe that something has changed , it was stated in the declaration .	-5.0785
But Mueller was only used after Trump had taxed Comey .	-3.3641
As a result of this smokescreen , accusations against Trump , he has been accused of obstructing the judiciary .	-6.2828
Comey said in June to a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop investigating the investigation of the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-4.9447
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation . . . .	-3.1402
After the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against special intermediaries and his employees .	-4.6392
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to release Mueller .	-2.6509
Unlike an independent special intermediary of Congress , such as Watergate affair , Mueller has resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be taxed by the President of the Justice Department .	-5.9567
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.8781
Two groups of republican and democratic senators put forward laws on Thursday , which the special intermediaries could no longer be made redundant .	-6.4876
Antarctica : Gigantischer Eisberg drives the Antarctica .	-3.2646
In the West Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg has been solved by the Schelfeis of Berlin .	-5.3522
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-2.2082
Over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of coloss treibe now to the north and will probably need two , three years until it is melted .	-7.4212
It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered in the past three decades .	-4.5561
It is not a threat to people .	-3.2964
To what extent climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear .	-3.7857
In total , however , there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice cubes in the region , the US Research Centre for Snow and ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-6.4552
According to many researchers , this can be linked to global warming .	-2.6390
The Koloss now closed was part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-5.5294
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-3.2145
It is thus growing ever further and breaks down regularly .	-5.3658
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.1407
Northern this scourge was disturbed by wax and disrupt a few years ago .	-6.5016
A complete cheek is there , AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen .	-3.7897
The Larsen-C Schelfeis is in danger , because the front edge edge edge edge has never withdrawn as far as .	-6.9924
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and can be broken if at a key point .	-6.3439
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea levels because they swim on the water and ice as much water as it is after melting itself .	-6.6496
However , the loss of the Schelfeise leads to the sea directly into the sea and much faster than before .	-5.7092
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for monitoring Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-5.4550
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is based on AWI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth .	-4.6288
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge of the free ocean .	-5.5280
It breaks down regularly .	-4.2501
" Although it is a natural event and we do not know any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now entering a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary from British Swansea University .	-5.0072
" This is the most far-reaching retreat since the beginning of the records " , he also confirmed .	-4.6167
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will now grow or fall back in the long term , and perhaps his colleague Adrian Luckman and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-7.6017
But that development will take decades .	-1.5945
Although these researchers do not return to climate change this gigantic iceberg has not fallen to climate change in recent decades , many ice cushions of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-5.9897
The Antarctica stretches towards South America .	-4.2982
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.8970
The decline in temperature increases .	-3.4039
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years , counting on the areas where temperature is fastest .	-6.4986
CDU wants Haustarif at the Staff	-4.7669
Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant posts , the CDU calls on the employer ’ s association to become more attractive .	-4.4867
Just before the summer break , the circle day 41 new posts in administration .	-5.0120
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.3808
Now 17 trainees have completed their first day of work .	-3.9778
The teachers seem to be very desirable .	-4.2763
Around 620 applications were recorded for the places this year .	-4.3185
Nevertheless , there is still a lack of staff to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks .	-6.1274
Currently there are still 50 posts at Mettmann .	-4.4342
Among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .	-4.7407
The CDU wants to take the initiative in the circle day with the FDP and the UWG to take the initiative and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .	-6.8501
The administration is intended to develop a concept for personnel development and personnel development ' .	-5.9812
The aim is to cover not only short-term needs for professionals but to counteract the shortage of professionals , it is to be future-oriented .	-7.7941
The overall concept should be based on the inside and outside , concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive , CDU , FDP and UWG .	-6.0925
That is already listening to a good approach .	-3.6615
The circle has to do with personnel problems that were not previously known .	-5.6439
Other cities attract good officials and employees , and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.8631
We are talking about a genuine ' competition of public employers ' .	-4.4272
There is a large number of employees who are sick or elderly from the service .	-6.2527
So it is time to act so that no more jobs remain unsettled .	-6.9001
But Klaus-Dieter peoples , group leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion .	-3.3000
He recently raised the issue of a faustdicke surprise when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover and the other parties .	-8.1146
Peoples want to be reviewed to enable all the possibilities of leaving the municipal employers ' association .	-6.5399
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the district administration with trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the local cities - want a house tariff ' , so peoples .	-7.7902
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay better to pay the employees and officials than it actually provides for the public service .	-6.3365
The salaries are currently prescribed , increases or more money only if you switch to a higher level that is based on professional years .	-5.6245
But the cycle ’ s tasks have grown ever more .	-4.6326
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up where employees were concerned about the provisions of the new prostitute protection law .	-4.7782
Last but not least , the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .	-3.4975
Italy aggravates the tone of NGO migrants rescue boats	-3.6078
Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations .	-4.6905
" If NGOs sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " said Minister of Home Affairs , Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turiner daily newspaper La Stampa .	-4.3623
Minni ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German Aid Organisation ' Youth Rettet ' , because their team worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-5.0639
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed allegations of the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-9.4539
" For us , and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that at the moment , we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " " " . " . " " " " . " " .	-8.0383
" We can only judge all the accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation ' .	-5.4794
The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of ' Youth Rettet ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.2055
It is presumed that his crew will take snake migrants on board who are delivered directly by human traffickers , and that smugglers can drive them back .	-8.7945
At least such a meeting , allegedly , only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media .	-8.5302
The crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coastguard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons , not for any other motives .	-4.4098
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must , above all , an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .	-3.6417
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have been agreed to keep to the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-4.0564
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would not bring ' substantial changes or disability ' of their rescue operations .	-5.0966
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors without Borders ( MSF ) .	-3.5048
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy , have fallen sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors .	-5.5761
" In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the Minister .	-2.9690
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.4248

In the E-Sport , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or just the football simulation FIFA at competitive level .	-5.0267
For a long time , as in normal sports , leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .	-6.0720
And with Asienspielen 2022 , E-Sport is already part of the official program .	-2.6608
But is it a real sport ?	-3.3274
For many , the idea is certainly needed .	-3.3190
Ingo Froböse has also addressed the question for a long time .	-3.1820
For Professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because he is competent and has many biological and physical reactions , which can also be seen in classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-6.9242
It also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and rapid reaction capability .	-6.8463
Professional gamers should be trained not only at the console , but also their bodies and respect their diet .	-5.7652
" The fitte player is a good player . "	-1.8199
Froböse also sees problems : " Doping is becoming increasingly a topic " .	-5.0150

Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind bars and five years have been suspended .	-4.4925
Carter was sentenced in June because of negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on 13 July 2014 .	-3.3839
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : " My family is unRoman .	-3.2884
My son was my best friend . "	-1.2253
Carter was allowed to remain free .	-4.3120
She was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered a mental illness .	-3.8018
In red hoses and a creamy coloured blouse , Carter da with tears in the eyes , with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down eyes when it was condemned .	-8.4083

" They ended his life to make their own better .	-2.1668
She did not accept responsibility ' , she said .	-3.2552
" She did not show any reue .	-4.9847
But Carters ’ lawyer said that it is a ' terrible circumstance that she totally deplores .	-5.1010
But Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find that their " age or maturity , or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions " .	-4.4493
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy ’ s mother Lynn Roy , who said that there is ' no day when I was not the loss of my beloved son .	-5.0116
I would like him to be proud of me and how I am going to work with all my pain , despite all my pain that we will be wearing for eternity with us , for his sisters ' .	-7.7358

" No longer this only person with whom I had since my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep for the rest of my life , " she said .	-6.3596
The case seems to set a legal precedent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-3.4010
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle .	-2.6885
The case drew national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that they encouraged him to end his life .	-4.1696
" Häng you , spring from a building , create yourself , I do not know , there are many ways ' , she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was in holiday with his family .	-5.5568

So , if you have become acquainted with the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-7.2956
Kimmich confirmed : " That is what you want as a player : responsibility " .	-3.4899
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old as a mini-Lahm was above the field .	-4.4153

He had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .	-4.6858
Vidal was not able to play his missing fitness ( clapped scarcely ) ; Renato Sanches to devil on the achievements of the Asia-trip ( also only limited ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did so in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot .	-10.3570

Süle ran beside Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both agated sovereign .	-3.7263
Napoli Sturm was often difficult , and he also tried to win some time in the game construction .	-11.5851

Lavender from Provence ’ s climate change threatens	-5.0513
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.0895
The lavender is declining due to drought and insects caused by drought , causing scientists and farmers who try to find solutions .	-5.3169
Eric Chaisse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The Lavendel in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has been much less rainy in spring , and in autumn much more .	-6.4862
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender .	-2.4604
There is also a small Zikade , a microbacterium that transmits the dwarf , and in very dry weather , there are very many of them ' .	-9.2104
And there is much at stake .	-1.8836
Lavendelöl is not only for holidaymakers , but it is .	-4.5391
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ohren with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-3.5491
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.6098

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico	-1.4882
The workers of the weekly Riodoce usually meet their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the Sinaloa state by organised crime , corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars .	-6.1814
But on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.4191
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.2040
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children with their office , who were in 2009 the aim of an attack with granates or leave them home .	-7.6792
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .	-3.8850
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and building chairs .	-4.6573
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists , who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or the cartels , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-5.6290
There is no respite from violence , and while throughout the country have accumulated , more journalists are growing : at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 , 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection , and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states .	-12.7815
Among the latter , her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce , the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.0681
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drugs .	-6.5465
His absence is deeply felt , even though his presence everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his middle finger with the word " Justice " , depends on the façade of the Riodoce-building , two reporters in the thirties , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , wear T-Shi.	-6.4030
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared themes , trauma , their nightmare , nightmare , paranoia .	-3.3578
Although a special office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , only two criminal proceedings have been initiated .	-6.6612
Like most thousands of murders who are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ’ murders are rarely brought to justice .	-4.4766
In Riodoce , they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are unRoman , and even though the terrain is still more trivial .	-6.5128
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security , little benefit , Ibarra says .	-3.6995
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop " , he says .	-1.8637
" Until we know why we are mistrust all . "	-3.8558
On the morning of 15 May , Valdez issued the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-3.9166
He was only able to drive a few blocks far before his roter Toyota Corolla of two men , and .	-6.2250
The shooter drove in his car and damaged it near .	-5.3282
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.4210
He left a woman and two adult children .	-0.9642
Rumors tend to move freely in Culiacan .	-3.9736
But on the subject of Valdez , there is virtually nothing to silence .	-3.8562
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa was one of the bloodiest battles in the country , because rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-4.1740
There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of ornamented two-storey mausoles for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living .	-6.2669
Forget for one minute that there is a state of ' calm ' if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-4.4293
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , with the fault that he could not protect his friend .	-3.7800
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder .	-1.2862
First , in February , the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman ’ s Söhnen .	-7.5246
This release may have annoyed the sons , suspected Gangma bought each copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosk .	-5.0717
The second mistake was to not force Valdez to force Valdez , after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country to its own security .	-5.2335
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.3488
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues believed that he would always be there .	-2.6521
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to create Riodoce and sold $ 50 .	-5.5156
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem " , Bojorquez said .	-3.1468
With time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising .	-4.5851
Reporters loved it to be able to publish hard examinations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle .	-5.0482
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize " for her coverage in Latin America .	-3.4556
In the same year , Valdez won the ' International Press Freedom Award ' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in prosecuting the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .	-5.1101
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-2.3932
" I would like to live " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.6021
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life " , he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV .	-2.8778
" You must take the task you as a journalist - either that or you play the shower .	-4.9892
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-4.0543
The Riodoce team missing Valdez , the Spaßvogel , who was able to curb the friend who was generous with armies and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-6.0501
You trust your routine .	-3.8435
He would always wear his dog .	-2.2443
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sitting on the same table .	-3.6999
Now they ask : Was his love to be routine ?	-3.5012
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best they can do their job and stay alive .	-4.3990
" You don 't like it if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret start-ups and landmarks .	-9.7159
" These things were not allowed " , said Bojorquez .	-1.4439
The result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.0749
His own instincts trust .	-2.3314
If it was wrong , it would be away .	-5.2940
The anger is , said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that " Geruch is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter with Javier . "	-4.9476
The old rules , as he and others say , Sinaloa are no longer valid in Sinaloa , as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .	-4.4051
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.4473
In the space in which the employees of Riodoce to security training , were suddenly no mobile phones allowed .	-10.1412
Draußen sought two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .	-2.9897
They were instructed by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-4.0552
Half in the cheerz , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belong to the 50 % of the policemen who were the governor himself as a untrustworthy .	-5.9593
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-5.0210
For the edition of this week , Riodoce has focused on three main stories .	-6.9119
There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-3.2394
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the hometown of the governor .	-4.0040
And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the Public Prosecutor ’ s office , a .	-8.1403
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it was done , so caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.7699
A reporter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who was registered to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost the whole century all political levels .	-5.6539
Recently , several PRI-governors have been accused of corruption .	-3.3920
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman a military incident .	-4.2529
Only a few months earlier , the readers of Valdez ’ s column would have considered the best informed source of abduction .	-4.2325
" We had already known what happened " , Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slender body stature .	-4.4015
" Now all the channels of communication with our sources . "	-3.3799
The Valdez office was devoted to storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-5.1271
Reporterin Miriam Ramirez snappte a few characters and went on the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the Office of the Public Prosecutor .	-4.9149
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.0165
A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.6069
Across the country , journalists have become loudest by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on salaries and buildings .	-5.7256
On this day , the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-4.1312
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth .	-4.7719
She has since been asking for it to be re-divided by the government because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity .	-5.6813
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a uniform society ' .	-4.8010
In his last book " Narco-Journalism " he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug-gangs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces committed to organised crime under a cover .	-5.9055
The media Guardian Group " Articulo 19 " has more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and officials .	-3.4903
" In Mexico , because they want you to die the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-4.3326
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-1.7289
Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.0411
Her body was found together with a note that supposedly signed by the Zeta Kartell : " Here I am because of my reports . "	-4.3636
A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .	-4.0569
Some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Norte border state Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-3.8529
Others continue , as El Manana from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-3.4184
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the heading " What do you want from us ? "	-4.7481
Some journalists have fled their own countries or even fled the country .	-2.7090
It is a painful decision .	-0.7375
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they still observe the roads and seek dangers .	-3.6731
And sometimes they are hunted , as it seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-5.4260
For those who remain behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.2233
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , gives the drug trade frightens him .	-4.8526
" Mexico goes to hell , and so I became reporter , " he said .	-2.9997
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Riodoce on the citizen 's stiff before the office and drank beer when all their phones began to summarise .	-7.2631
A number of shipyards with bandenriches and security forces near Mazatlan had 19 confirmed dead .	-5.0825
The war escalated further , as promised by a series of cartels in the region .	-2.8153
From the Bordstein edge they published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone .	-4.3307
The front page had to be changed next day .	-2.6040
Sirenen heulten near - another shooting in the area .	-3.9060
Bojorquez warf a look at the policemen who kept guards to see if they were ready .	-3.7724
If they were afraid , they did not show it .	-3.4154
Under the enormous portrait of the founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa , the employees of Riodoce had its traces .	-5.7070
" As you can only remember , " said Bojorquez , " if on the same day when Javier was murdered , the interns me asked me to send them to the street . "	-5.6142
Dinosaurier used Tarnung to soften his enemies .	-2.6733
At first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening .	-3.0328
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible nose of a Canadian mining worker were so well received that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurier .	-4.2285
It was so good that they could even find that his glove skin was of Roman brewing - and they said they had something of a ' troubled past ' .	-5.9949
The report in the journal " Current Biology " described him as " the best preserved dinosaurier ever found , and one of the best dinosaur copies of the world " .	-5.6869
The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.4589
His unbelievably well-preserved state has researchers who describe it as " truly remarkably " remarkably " .	-5.8121
According to National Geographic , the coated plant frescos is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-4.4653
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-2.4465
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rocks , and decided to look more closely .	-4.2582
The Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology .	-2.2451
They spent the next six years trying to reveal the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) of heavy earth cleavage .	-5.4856
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.4194
" If you blink a little with the eyes , you might almost believe that it has lazy , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is seen .	-6.5447
" It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosauriere .	-4.9155
Researchers found that this plant frescos , even though it is covered with armor and resembles a walled tank , probably by flesh dinosaurs .	-6.1714
The highly acclaimed Dinosaurier used a red and white target to hide predators and used a shield technique that is known as a counterfeiting technique , which is also used by many modern animals .	-8.8469
This would have allowed itself to mix better in its surroundings and to soften their enemies , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-6.1323
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-2.7765
Researchers have studied the wild animal and put it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumstechnician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours with care .	-5.3031
The astonishing conservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of firearms and armor over his body .	-4.9554
They discovered contershading , a common defense method in animal rich , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than their bottom .	-4.0259
Although contershading is customary , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta is far from the animals living today .	-4.6477
It suggests that the dinosaurier was driven by enough pressure from meat eating dinosaurs , that evolution encouraged confrontation as a means of survival .	-6.3685
But most contemporary animals that use contershades - think of Rehe , Zebras or belts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to real struggle for survival .	-5.2405
" Starkes Raubtier-behavior on a massive , heavily afflicted dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been " , said Brown .	-6.5183
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosauriers was red .	-3.9187
Scientists continue to study the animal on his life , including his conservative Darminus , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .	-5.1967
They believe that the Dinosaurier , when he died , went into a river and moved into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .	-4.8068
At that time , Alberta was as warm as southern florida today , and rivers and oceans are likely to go much further than they are today .	-4.6063
" This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with conservative shoppers , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of animal , " said Brown .	-6.7163
" The result is that the animal looks almost as like in the early chalk time .	-4.4381
You don 't need much imagination to use it to reconstruct it ; if you only have a little with the eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping .	-6.7007
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs , the earth .	-5.2377
Although the king of them , the tyrannosaurus Rex , millions years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his furious ancestors .	-5.0118
The Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-5.8962
Scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Borealopelta has been contaminated in the sea and in mum .	-6.1299
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-2.1522
According to the museum , it is the best preserved dinosaurs of the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snout to the hip .	-5.1672
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.5116
It contained two 20-inch long peaks that were demanding by his shoulders .	-5.7957
The researchers believe that the armored plant frescoed by Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea .	-5.8587
But the underwater treatment of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail .	-4.8954
The hidden remains of this special specimens are so good that the skin remains still hollow panels along the Dinosaurier ’ s di.	-7.5780

In the storm : Mass carambolage on A8 : Many injured persons injured , many injured persons .	-6.8793
Hefty accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Knapp 30 vehicles are included in a mass carambolage .	-4.9034
There are many injured , kilometres of congestion and suitcases .	-2.9747
On the highway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) , the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carambolage around 20 people were injured .	-5.8382
According to the police figures , at 5.00 p.m. between the adjoining nobility and Odelzhausen ( district Aichach-Friedberg ) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , inexpensive vehicles .	-8.4583
The exact number of injuries were not available at first .	-5.0989
It is easy to medium heavy injuries , said a police spokesman .	-4.1830
A great offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident point .	-3.8706
The A8 was completely closed to Munich .	-2.6543
In Munich , a 10-kilometre long backlog was formed .	-7.3174
As an AZ reporter reports , there was also a number of passengers on the opposite track to massive disabilities .	-7.8701
The fire brigade has noted the hallmarks of the vehicle lenker , who now have severe penalties .	-6.8670
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-3.2904
It was a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-4.1122

Deutsche Bahn : Group testet " Comfort Check-in " comfort check-in " .	-4.0964
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is hanging in the train and sleeps .	-5.3059
Or one is deepened into his work and has just a brilliant idea .	-4.5565
And then : pufff .	-1.2342
If the creator gets an ungentle or rides the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-6.9057
Ticket control .	-3.1591
But the times of interruptions are soon over .	-2.3627
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creator lose ticket control .	-4.5684
It is simply confirmed by mobile phones that you take their place and devalue the ticket .	-6.0895
A test operation is currently running on two tracks .	-3.6856
" If the offer is available , .	-6.8818
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other routes in Germany , " said a railway line .	-5.8154
" Comfort Check-in " calls the train ticket devaluation without Schaffner .	-4.3684
However , in order to be able to use some of the conditions : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-5.3593
And you have to book an online ticket - which is already most passengers .	-4.9152
It is also necessary to buy the train , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticketing .	-8.8311
Last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-2.7411
Because the " Comfort check-in " works so : you rise in the train , calls his ticket under " My tickets " .	-5.2813
For the test customers , a button for electronic devaluation .	-5.0155
The train attendants receive a message that passenger X is in train and has taken the seat Y .	-5.6956
When the train attendant at the ticket control , he knows that a passenger is already sitting there with an already devalu.	-9.2409
So we can continue to sleep , continue to stay silent .	-5.0001
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use passengers .	-5.5099
" If you want to relax without ticket control through our train staff , check in the DB Navigator .	-5.9218
This makes it possible for passengers to make their travel time by train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr .	-5.2594
Second Plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.6083
If you are travelling by train , you will be aware that , in addition to delays and passages , you will be able to travel by train .	-10.6243
It is often the case that you do not have all the documents you need to upgrade online tickets .	-7.1765
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show .	-5.6989
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the downside or large room and delays in control of their own tickets and the creator at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .	-8.4612
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.0585

How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Whose Streets ? "	-2.6074
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-2.3087
Just one day after she arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scroll through Facebook on her phone .	-4.4377
She stolperte via a post from someone from the High School .	-2.8840
" The police has just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street " , it was said there .	-5.3364
If no one else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-5.1738
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah has been constantly on her timeline .	-3.8960
The rapper from St. Louis was killed by Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-4.0297
He posted an image of Browns ’ vibrant body that was broadcast on the street and would stay there four hours .	-6.2152
" This is wild " , thought Ferrell at itself .	-3.8970
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-2.0437
She left her mobile phone to return to Tweets on people to return to the Canfield-Drive .	-5.0859
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and by a man who claimed to be Browns 's father who had a sign with the signature : " Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-5.2385
They observed a live feed in which a policeman in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellenden dog .	-4.1156
In another video , she said , she secured a different policeman and shouted : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-5.2336
" This is not customary , " Ferrell recalled his statement .	-4.5143
" This is not the kind of murder we have used to call and which we can call it . "	-5.5196
At this moment I felt pupil frost .	-3.0172
I was angry and crying . '	-1.8712
She booked a return flight and went home next day .	-3.5427
After landing at 23 p.m. , she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson .	-5.9289
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson , is the subject of a new documentary film , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from 11 .	-3.7287
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience , strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .	-5.0833
When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter , who had a flower dress and a crown , after Ferguson , spoke to Ferguson , the two who had a conversation that she had a lot of time before this morning » about black experience and black state « .	-10.6268
" You remember how I taught thee when black people have to fight for what they think ? " reminded them of what they said .	-5.4130
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.3761
I could not take it " , said Ferrell later .	-2.7880
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.2373
It must be aware and it must be brought up .	-5.4822
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to get free to get rid of ourselves .	-4.6824
Even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not see any glaring racism , she is not unlike the next black women 's child .	-6.8010
I feel that I would be doing a bad service to them away from it . '	-4.6669
The first station when it arrived in Ferguson , was located at the South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a campsite when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-7.0760
Ferrell and her daughter joined a local businessman who made lunch .	-4.5106
They prepared pockets and helped communicate them to demonstrators .	-3.9298
Slowly began a new type of activism for Ferrell .	-2.0618
" My activism changed after 9 August total , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri St Louis .	-10.6931
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.5863
Everything has come . '	-2.0753
weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-director of the film .	-1.9491
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only " documenting what happened .	-2.3413
A question came Ferrell in sense : " Would you document or try to find a story that you can use ? "	-5.6106
This skepticism has been fed by countless cases of people , often by white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-7.8289
As Folayan recently said in an interview : " We heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up , their voices did not centred and we wanted to make it different . "	-4.8006
Folayan had already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the area known for his activism around death tractor .	-4.9748
His commitment brought Ferrell to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-6.2975
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us , " said Davis .	-2.8340
" That was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because I will be presented . "	-4.9930
The aim was not to focus on Ferrells 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-5.0995
As a result , documents from " Whose Streets ? " surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells 's life , as they love and marry her wife .	-4.8112
" I felt like naked " , said Ferrell and laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-1.8058
" But I understood that there must be a certain degree of vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people . "	-5.5902
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement .	-3.7599
Two of the three founders of the movement that after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-4.4210
" Black , gay women in senior positions have worn the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and so we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-4.7398
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything ' .	-2.5035
Folayan voted to say that " the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-3.4235
However , it insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film .	-3.8300
" She was the person who stirred this energy , " she said .	-3.2241
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life of these crossings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake .	-5.4766
You can feel your energy through the screen . "	-2.5513
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue .	-3.1335
Ferrell is on the Becurrency for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration .	-4.3438
It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that it calls her home : " chaos " .	-4.3842
However , she still clings to a vocals and she feels obliged to this memory since she went to the street three years ago .	-8.4337
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.1858
It is our duty to win .	-0.8718
We must love and support each other .	-1.2474
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-1.8515
From " Dream " to " magnitude " : TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery " .	-4.3164
The Bit Gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a .	-3.7228
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone , since the first presentation of 2009 , the people in favour and opponents .	-4.4009
Kalt leaves the subject .	-4.6874
Also on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " will be discussed .	-3.3466
While one of the Bit Gallery say : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , comes from the other side : " Do no man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " magnitude ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.0520
While supporters build a gallery more customers into the city , which also benefits the rest of business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will blunt .	-9.0111
In addition , the gallery will be planned on the plot where the farm market hall stands where 13 direct marketing products offer their products .	-6.7570
The beginning of the construction work will end .	-4.2558
The gallery Macher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - for the Beda-square with the possibility to sit outside .	-5.8911
Simone Room : " We have been buying for many years almost weekly in the farm market hall .	-4.2980
Most of our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of rural women .	-4.6518
We have also discovered the metzgerei for ourselves .	-4.4887
We would like to see that even during and , above all , there is an opportunity to maintain this offer .	-5.0387
In other cities , this is also true .	-4.0088
The small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting .	-3.7945
Gerd Densing : " Whether directly marketed in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent is coming to the height of the rental .	-6.6749
However , this should not be low in the new project . '	-4.9140
Eva Kilic : " Wozu Shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.3431
Whether clothing , shoes , drought or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-4.0529
There is enough in our city .	-3.3827
One can see how many retail shops are empty - some for months and years .	-4.4340
However , since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that we at least have the market hall .	-5.3056
After all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is above price .	-7.1476
As you can see , retail shops in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the rents are often unsustainable for a retailer .	-8.0332
It is a pity that special deals are almost no longer and what remains of it will disappear . '	-7.4093
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not match me .	-3.3980
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-1.9405
Above all , where is the farm-market hall should go down ?	-6.7203
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term if the Bit Gallery actually comes .	-4.3150
Or does it create the specter Bit Gallery before selling all the shops from Bitburg ? "	-8.0642
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-1.8931
And a shopping center that is empty , no one needs .	-3.3843
In my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market rather than this gallery .	-3.6016
But for a farm market hall , thanks to the madness of many - as I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-9.0081
If the farm is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . '	-4.4408
A suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA DNA .	-2.3549
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost inviolable the same - the cod of the ceiling .	-5.9810
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and hair cuts sent to Chelsea Manning .	-3.6638
Manning sent the paragraphs from Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence analyst a 35-year-old prison sentence , after having classified as secret secret secret secret diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website .	-8.3304
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A suitable similarity ) .	-2.4106
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline has been transformed into technology , computer science and art , and Manning , a transwoman and pioneering dissidentin , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-6.1071
Dewey-hagborg has been extracted by the algorithmic analysis of DNA , which was extracted from Manning , and made out of the 30 portraits , how someone could look like this genomic data , a sharp , albeit intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created identity .	-8.1570
Manning , who was born as Bradley Edward , but has been openly talking about identification as a woman , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the espionage law , computer fraud and theft .	-5.8429
By the jail , her image was suppressed , so much that there was only one photo - a baskettle , black and white selfie , in which manning clearly appears on a driver 's seat and a burglary - with which she was associated .	-9.7502
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012-project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-3.4224
It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette stummel and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people might look like .	-5.3345
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine .	-2.1138
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.8279
And she could not attend this time and she could not be photographed , so you contact Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-8.3421
The artist and her imprisoned Muse were exchanged into unequal letters over two years .	-5.0267
They even created a of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic " Suppressed Images " that predicted a future in which the President of Chelsea 's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-4.7219
Indeed , Obama ’ s release only a few days after the book was published , Mannings ’ release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , a welcome kind of happy coincidence .	-5.3065
There is also now at the opening of the exhibition , a little low and Starkes , as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender-troops to find new , tweet-capable ways to resolve the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .	-9.2965
When Dewey-hagborg was asked about all these things , she said , " things happen for a specific reason " .	-4.3164
In a painting on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for Manning with its oversized signature ( the " i " in their family name is marked with a heart ) an end of the " automatic fragmentation , whose basis of gender , race , sexuality and culture .	-8.5808
On the opposite wall , their mitochondriale DNA sequence - a thousand inserter of Cs and Gs and as , in pencil .	-4.8437
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the 200 letters ( or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist ) , how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-4.8382
" What people will hopefully take away is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , also can be .	-6.2681
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . "	-3.1371
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own space is a page from the above comic novella .	-5.6842
She shows Manning how she appeared with a free phone call from the disciplinary arsenal of the United States such as King-Kong .	-6.5000
" When they cold your speech , they won ' , it says .	-5.4663
" So never stop the mouth " .	-2.3803
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me " , said the artist who greet from Philadelphia .	-3.1888
" I still get ferries when I talk about it ' .	-4.4625
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition - just as foresight in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own genomic simulacres , which are like hordes of protest .	-7.9251
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Statur ) , where their genetic haplogrous were written with pencil .	-5.6927
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel that they like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits .	-5.1518
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was formed behind its liberation . "	-5.8691

" We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future " - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko .	-4.3299
Russian Deputy remier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for restoring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-2.7228
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.6155
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect " , said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.5983
The PM commented the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code , which describes the criteria for reintroducing RUSADA and recently published on the organisation 's website .	-4.5834
According to Mutko , he has nothing to worry about Russia .	-2.8849
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-2.4271
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , he added .	-2.8724
One of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have reported the results of the WADA approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-5.5994
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : ' We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake .	-4.7283

Errett said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-3.5797
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can follow why .	-6.2058
Companies are coming to see that at the top of job culture so that you do not become the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment that punishes those who have spoken .	-5.7530
For start-ups like Glint , this desire is a lucrative business opportunity .	-3.3442
Global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , following the financial site Let 's Talk Payments .	-3.8056
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the middle of the Uber case .	-4.5169
Convercent has nearly 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.4821
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-2.6956
Like Glint , Convercent companies can send tailor-made " surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and to view the heat types of your problem areas .	-6.4908
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows people to report bad behavior .	-3.9540
And if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-3.5693
" The court of public opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-4.0313
When a company is found that its employees are badly treated or unethical , it can cost costly consequences by consumer boycott , worker mobility and complaints , Quinlan said .	-6.1230
Ruby Tuesday , the Restaurant-Kette with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Convercent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and procedures , and have a simple way to achieve their headquarters .	-6.4347
In the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously .	-5.9024
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints from employees .	-3.3608
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems that have previously been hided by executives that have been hidden in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair internships .	-6.3859
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view into experience with employment , " said Vitrano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-4.4006
" And we protect our shareholders from employment - litigation . "	-5.2117
Companies began to take more seriously ethics , values and employee commitment in 2002 after the accounting -Firma Arthur Andersen for ethical violations by the Enron scandal , said Quinlan .	-5.3086
But it took until the " social media rightly came to their right " that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .	-5.7080
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-2.6412
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service , and burden burden the companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-7.4629
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start-ups .	-3.7314
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , thereby raising the entire capital to $ 47 million .	-3.8954
Glitcers secured $ 10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners , and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .	-3.5715
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-3.0236
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than before .	-6.8945
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only sales .	-3.4547
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.8358
" If people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices belongs , and that the work you are doing is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which both Convercent and Glint .	-5.3221
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well , and businesses are good if employees are involved .	-6.7545
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-5.0626
Data on employee commitment to the experts of job culture .	-4.1936
But the data are useless when the managers of a company do not take action .	-4.0287
Indeed , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .	-4.1652
And if change does not come fast enough , or at all , it can be disappointments and employees .	-4.9708
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International , which has seen too much on collecting data .	-4.7659
" For if you don 't follow employees ask me , " Have you heard me really ?	-5.9847
Are you looking for it ?	-2.8524
And who do not care about why should I ? '	-4.2209
Madison Reed , who is now running monthly surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint , so Errett .	-4.9181
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication to address the problems .	-5.9092
At Ruby Tuesday , the company gets new insights about employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high turnover .	-6.4723
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people ' , said Vitrano .	-2.3587
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-2.3936
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.3835
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for Bruins .	-4.7554
At 23 p.m. , when a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .	-5.7077
Some have withdrawn their tricot upper parts and show the back full sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-5.7468
For a good part of the team , they are a lunch break .	-4.4316
Players who are committed to the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise exercise to their final exams before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 pm to the Football Center .	-7.9060
" This is for the guys the next three days a real tretmill " , said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday was Tuesday .	-4.6262
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.8796
That is why the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19 : 15 p.m. to meet the already completed schedule .	-6.8298
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the break starts at the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood .	-5.8681
In the course of August 18 exercises , 20 before the formal preparation of game preparation for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-9.8834
Mora said that he supports the regulatory change of the NCAA , even if they add another point .	-4.5293
" We place this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-3.0857
" And they simply pushed through , they are great people .	-4.1532
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-3.6534
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is closed , given the clear visibility lines of its fields from a adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the elevated class , which has already been used with foot balls , which will be a protective net behind a torpfosten .	-8.8709
Bruins-Spieler will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free .	-5.3147
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.3174
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people are there to rent a room and then set up there to be an exercise .	-5.6554
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is a pretty good business .	-2.6262
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking .	-3.6296
We will do the best to do with what we have .	-1.6240
I am not concerned about this .	-3.6425
We have a plan . '	-0.8049
Facebook wants to intensify the campaign against counterfeit messages .	-6.6151
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news at fake reviews from third parties and their results under the original contribution , then the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , it is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake-news .	-6.3478
The company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify potential falsification and to send them to fact-checking results from the original article .	-6.5579
Facebook was criticized as one of the main points for so-called fake-news , many of whom believe they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-4.6269
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters in the run-up to the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany supported a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before the elections in September .	-6.1700
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that the US , France , the Netherlands , and Germany , will launch a test of the new fact-review .	-4.6657
" In addition to the realization of the stories of facebook verifiers of third parties , the people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook-News in a blog .	-5.7887
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the " article " and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages .	-5.0150
Creating a comic novel : A castle in the history of England .	-2.8120
In his recent past , the small Scotney Castle in a Squeeze music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-4.2834
But Scotney has 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent , and has now become inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-4.8105
" I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " says he wewehly .	-5.3155
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . "	-2.7699
'A Castle in England ' , revived the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney , , and .	-12.1002
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : He wrote in 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly emotionally .	-3.7827
" I only responded to the pressure on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 years , which was written for the Jakobiner worked " , he says .	-5.6557
" That is his fingerprint !	-2.3292
And letters always smell after smoke , because at that time , you breed fire because of light .	-6.5057
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were himself .	-4.6044
Ach , I love Archive ! "	-7.0363
For someone who has been beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle ( " To be honest : I have my welcome welcome greeting a little overvalued " ) it seems all too beautiful to be true .	-6.0014
Rhodos spent his days exploring the viktorian " new " castle , watch the archives and discover the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the monstrous Hyänenköpfe on the walls and the bottles that spent centuries in the grave .	-6.5917
He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapes , ferries and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-6.4700
Then , at night , he trank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-4.6699
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only received full access in 2006 , when the last Erbin , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.9707
When Rhodes entered a decade later , employees began to look after the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which Aristocrats said " Oh , they were on the roof .	-6.0956
Tagebücher , letters from the time of English empires , cards that represent what possessed : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a Birke to fight the two families .	-5.6843
Young , let everything go ! "	-4.1675
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to appear on a broader basis in English history , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly-built castle to join the farmer 's rebuilt castle in 1381 .	-6.8159
" There is a record of an uproar that appeared in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-4.2689
" The farm uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .	-3.6361
Perhaps the two are interconnected ? '	-4.1649
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit pater tells the Darrell family for seven years during English reform .	-4.7347
Or ' The Smuggler ' , in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century , which was his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his sarg was ) .	-6.8229
The Darrells are Rhodes ’ favorite family of Scotney : " The masters seemed to be pretty Gauner to keep debt and spend money on things they could not afford .	-5.2331
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to advertise herbs . " " " " " " . " " " " " " " " " " . " " " " " " " " " " " " " "	-11.5849
After the end of his use in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experience .	-4.5039
He has made a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki , the site of a sanatoriums dating back to the early 20th century .	-5.5776
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.6786
" I was sad to go back , " he says .	-1.7692
It was like : " Ach , now I have to cope with the damned life . "	-4.2375
Campaign started : over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf .	-2.8205
With the contraception of 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau from Thursday ) .	-5.6021
Until Thursday mayor of Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Artz the logo and the slogan secret .	-4.3298
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth .	-2.8942
" Too nice for us .	-5.4104
Or ? " , ask the Macher of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-5.3152
" We think that ( of course ! ) do not really " , write them on their website yesterday .	-3.9067
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.6691
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .	-3.6901
Basically , we firmly believe that , as a bath of Honnefer citizens , we know the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-6.2752
The action is more than " only " a logo and a slogan , meaning it goes on .	-5.7535
" It is necessary to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistakable omnipresent " .	-7.0847
After all , they compete with other communities .	-3.1406
The city of Bad Honnef has its new umbrella brand and cost the campaign .	-5.2250
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan 's fear of the army	-2.0662
In early August , Ankara is advising the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) on retirement and promotions in the Official Corps .	-5.9519
This week .	-1.8107
At first glance a normal process .	-1.7444
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.8444
The meeting took place no longer in the building of the general stable , as it was in the prime minister 's seat .	-6.2278
The discussions under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government now also took part in the five Vice-remiers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Home Affairs Ministers .	-6.1760
In that way , civilians were in the YAS .	-4.8804
The government attracts the military .	-3.5825
Hulusi Akar is still in office , but the commanders of the army , the army 's commanders , the air forces and .	-5.5257
Since the failed coup , Prime Minister Erdogan has fired 169 of 326 generals and admirals .	-3.2650
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the exile Prediger Fethullah Gülen , the Erdogan as a drahter of the coup attempt .	-5.0701
Against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , has been negotiated in Ankara this week . .	-8.3501
On the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the “ Gottesenk ” , because he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces " .	-5.9916
But does Erdogan really manage the army ?	-2.4202
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unbehagen in the military headquarters " .	-3.4115
In general , there are concerns about increasing " Islamization " of the army , which manifests itself in the lifting of the headscarf for Soldaters , the newspaper wrote .	-6.3521
In any case , the army and the security forces goes further .	-5.1813
In mid-July , Erdogan made a further 7395 public servants , including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers .	-4.0189
It seemed that Erdogan had counted the military .	-4.6158
The generals were formerly the real masters of the country .	-4.2826
Three times they were questioned on their role as guardian of the secular state order .	-5.0708
Following his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back the military step by step , not least by calling on the European Union ’ s reforms .	-4.8248
Former officers say that Erdogan is a targeted Islamization of the armed forces .	-3.9684
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a namesake of not named officers who sought asylum after the coup attempt to seek asylum abroad , the Turkish army would be ' full of extremists and salafists ' .	-7.3845
If that happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-4.2746
In any case , the Alliance has doubts about the willingness to use the Turkish army .	-4.6434
The management structures and operational capabilities are " weakened , say Nato diplomats .	-3.1510
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card	-1.9899
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , President Donald Trump , cited by the media .	-1.9387
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas .	-4.2173
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-4.7037
The draft bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.8396
" This law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other Green Cards . "	-4.4097
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.0862
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-4.6339
Ministry wants to track track track for racing enthusiasts .	-5.9662
Over the past few months , the future of the racing huttles was yesterday - now it is going to go very quickly .	-7.9631
Even before the end of the year , the maroden route on which the tourist train will be built .	-6.3154
In order to secure the future of the racing huttles , the Ministry of Transport will start construction work on the track .	-6.4078
" With the decision to continue to order the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig , the country is committed to this mainly for tourism , " declared Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-7.1611
The cost of repairing the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million .	-4.0962
Of this sum , the country takes 75 % .	-3.7849
The Treaty , based on which the shuttle is intended to be ordered by the country in the future , is now being voted definitively .	-7.3372
The Ministry and South Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .	-3.8358
" This is the roadmap , the vehicles used and quality standards , " said Sühl .	-4.8510
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .	-3.0107
The race track shuttle will be scheduled for December 2017 .	-5.9008
The racetrack shuttle is a popular destination for tourists .	-5.8908
Over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested as to whether the route is used by enough many people to re-order them in the future .	-6.6542
The route is also due in parts .	-3.4463
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried about the rise of sex robots .	-3.0533
Just as you thought that in 2017 cannot be even more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .	-4.7185
Yes , indeed .	-0.9920
Sex-robots are now a big thing .	-2.2413
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.3664
According to Noel Sharkey , emeritized professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University , and co-founder of FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-3.1848
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the chest and the type of fingernagel .	-3.4510
" People are funny about them , but the companies supply a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , " said Mr Sharkey said when publishing his new report .	-6.3468
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-5.3519
The user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions " and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-6.3815
But it will be even more worrying because many robots have " personalities " that would make a stepford-woman look progressively .	-5.6536
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.3448
The RealBotix-Roboter allows , for example , to adapt their robots to the characteristics they look like , for example .	-6.9784
And then there is also the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of pupils and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-5.9558
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible " , the site of True Companion .	-3.3584
So it may be what you like , and it doesn 't like what you like , etc .	-4.4392
Over the course of the day , she also has their votes - like real people !	-5.8944
It may be tired to be fixed on conversation or it can be " in mood " ! "	-7.3684
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the subservient female characteristics , the contagion on rape if one step on Frigid ( i.e. here : resisting ) Farrah , is a most .	-7.8990
On his website , True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.2854
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men have no roxxy ? " is it on the website .	-4.4395
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toys .	-3.6380
Their origins and their growing refinement indicate somewhat darker and depths in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-6.3930
Most men will , of course , have no sex robots , and while the FRR increases their popularity , they still remain on the edge of consumer culture .	-8.9573
But what emerges from the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time we live in .	-5.2326
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives permission .	-3.1836
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots are appearing in a time when women ’ s rights are under threat in the White House , where there is a president who has blamed women to have sexually attacked . .	-7.3533
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphic images , the winding bodies and the fleshed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.5222
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment does not feel like a great leap .	-3.1272
The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with porn proportions ) .	-4.1369
Their builders want to feel humane that they feel the movement of a real body .	-4.8772
But , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , the robots are not real women .	-3.0702
They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .	-3.8715
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjugation .	-4.7255
In other words , they are slaves .	-1.5888
Or to put it in the 2017 speech : service powers dchen	-5.5666
Trump ’ s great achievement ?	-1.7650
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense .	-2.3723
It has become a truism of the Trump era that polarized political divisions that have polarized the US electorate , including families in small format .	-5.1181
Around Christmas and Erntedankfest , there were newspapers in the United States about how to deal with the horror of Trump .	-3.8406
We are all supposed to let our filter bubbles burst .	-4.4795
Less notice has been noticed by Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-3.9762
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.9368
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect on a common enemy . . , . . . . . . , . . . . .	-6.0434
With Trump in the White House , everyone who knows , including the Republican kinship that she had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .	-5.2178
To the table , that is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this entails considerable risks .	-6.0858
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the staggering effect of his presidency has the power to push us all .	-4.4892
When we talk about " normalization " and Trump , we refer to the gruelling possibility that his powers will no longer be deducted .	-6.5235
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right-wing wing wing , which suddenly appear to appear as an epitome of sensibility compared to its . , , . . , . . , . . , . . .	-10.5876
Today , I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s funny version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement ) - both compared to Trump , in fact , a very mild offence .	-7.7122

When my cousine in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the carousel of the New York Park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don 't need a coff.	-5.5660
The horses are huge , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarce and the animals are twisted to look at their own shoulders - extremely finster and the climate-friendly music conveys this in a strange way .	-8.2880
So many clichés of a city : the views of high buildings are old , which skylines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city does not meet the dream .	-5.2104
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not entirely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - but a large circular traffic in the north of London .	-6.1953
However , the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience , since two two-year old , an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old and two women in the . . , , , , .	-11.3155
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-4.0948
On the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-4.3726
In the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to compensate for a 15 % tip - to buy something about the charge .	-6.0624
This does not only lead to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no necessary .	-4.7992

Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city builders , is going to retire in the . , , . . . . . . . . . .	-7.4241
The job is already advertised - but suitable candidates are rare .	-5.1769
For 31 years , Wacker has been the city builder .	-4.2471
And the work still gives him great fun , as he conveys in the press interview .	-7.1578
He reports of varied but challenging tasks that await his successors .	-3.8509
At the same time , he is surprised that no application will meet the requirement profile .	-4.9184
The city is looking for an architect or building engineer .	-3.5632
In this way - with regard to regular termination periods - is still enough time for a review .	-8.6593
As Haslach is responsible for the administrative community as a subordinate authority , the applicant must provide appropriate qualifications .	-6.6440
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case .	-3.7079
If they were no longer able to fill them , citizens would have to travel to Offenburg .	-5.7190
But proximity is the city and it itself important to him , Wacker says Wacker , who reports from a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and citizens .	-7.3329
In more than 30 years , some significant projects have accumulated on Wacker with pride .	-4.1804
" We make the city worth " , he is assured of the construction office and its employees .	-5.0619
In the future , however , varied projects are on the agenda : redesigned by the former Hukla Arena and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for example , are also .	-7.6257
The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , also the stadium renovation is still subject .	-3.6019
The latter alone will beat around EUR 1.5 million to beech , ' if we do ' s right ' , estimates Wacker .	-8.0822
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-3.7487
The work here is fun . "	-2.1380
There is a great room for manoeuvre for a city builder .	-5.8340
With Haslachs ’ own construction house and gardening can respond to a lot of flexibility .	-6.7911
" You can move a lot " , so wacker , and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .	-5.3785
As the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have " an eye for what is fit " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city builders .	-7.7347
In any case , the town mayor is responsible .	-6.6342
He is a builder , " at the end of everything here on my table " .	-4.6497
He can count on many years of staff : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been working for the past ten years , Manfred Schöner ( ) . . , .	-9.5985
Also , that his successor would like Wacker : " We are looking for someone who wants to be really identified with the place and stay " .	-7.7672
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city .	-5.1286
If you want to inherit the city of Haslach , you should have a completed study as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor with technical direction architecture and the right of expertise in the fields of construction and planning law .	-10.9626

Bicycle on guided guided tours : South Railways closed .	-6.8866
According to police , the previously unknown perpetrators had the blue bike from the railway line in the area of Leobener Strasse ( B116 ) .	-6.0703
These were severely damaged so that the incoming freight train had to be stopped .	-4.9493
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for the night hours .	-5.1276
Near the Tatort were witnesses a rosaroter roller and a bicycle driver .	-5.3656
" This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich " , said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch to APA .	-2.5563
The perpetrators or the perpetrators would have brought themselves into great danger and also jeopardising access .	-6.4533
In addition to the damage to the locality and the equipment and the delay and the cost of rail transport could also be pampered to the perpetrators .	-9.5086
Overall , the spokesman said that the spokesman .	-5.7630
The damage had been rectified on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the South track could be carried out without disabilities .	-7.8706
Almost ten passenger trains were excluded from Friday morning , two of them affected .	-5.7589
Goods did not fall , but they had delayed .	-2.1487
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch , around 200 meters had to be exchanged .	-3.0513
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.3664
Red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD ( inflammatory disease ) .	-3.1257
Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .	-1.7966
But a new study asserts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat based proteins and dairy products , could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases .	-4.9068
The insoluble state , which affects around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom , 300,000 , causes stomach and leaves , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .	-7.4078
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal intestinal .	-6.4704
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immunositional cells in Darm are patrouillieren to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body .	-7.3704
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissue .	-7.5571
If the balance goes too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory disorder . .	-7.7575
In experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance for immunization at mice that carries a certain bacterium in their enclosure .	-10.8737
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .	-2.8528
Professor Colonna said : " We have a link between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the microbioms , and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance .	-3.2856
The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells " .	-3.3850
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a druyptophan rich diet , promotes less inflammatory intestinal intestinal , if the same system also affects people .	-6.2069
The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immunization cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not had .	-5.2453
She believed that the difference with the intestinal robiomen of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungal fungi that normally live in the stomach .	-5.9335
The dams of mice were DNA sequentially and six bacteria species found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing from the mice .	-6.1546
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they did not develop this kind of immunization , and they did not develop this type of immunization cells , and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells .	-7.5969
In order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers L. reuteri grew into a fluid and then passed small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - on unmature immune cells that were isolated by mice .	-7.2498
Immune cells developed to tolerate tolerant cells .	-3.0154
When the active component was cleaned from liquid , it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan-metabolism , known as the Indol-3 milk acid .	-5.0977
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 % , but when the trutophane values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.7436
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells like mice , and that most of us L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-4.0658
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri , the cells develop in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to Tryptophan .	-5.2567
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells inflammation on the inner surface of the Darms .	-3.9760
Potentiell can lead to an expansion of this population . "	-5.5365
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a " Genie " .	-5.1580
At Manchester United , with Nemanja Matic , signed a " Genie " , Jose Mourinho , after the middle feldplayer played his debut at Sampdoria .	-6.3494
The £ 40 million signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira .	-4.9265
However , Matic was excluded from the Preparatory Asia Tournee of Blues and managed only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season .	-6.3733
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football " , said Mourinho .	-1.7842
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-1.9194
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku in the Aviva-Stadion , as Mourinho started his start XI for the beginning of . , , .	-5.1983
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments , but he insisted that the club has already done a ' fantastic job ' , three of his four priority commitments .	-4.9886
" Three of four , for which I thank the association " , he added .	-4.0578
" I will be happier if they get four out of four , but they have taken a great deal . "	-4.7098
Boeing " malt " Dreamliner in the sky .	-2.1117
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-2.9440
The pilots flew from Seattle to the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , which are several thousand kilometres .	-6.6259
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.5647
On the radar screens , the form of a Dreamliner .	-4.1420
The whole was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.4652
Boeing had already made such advertising .	-1.9882

New Tiefstrike for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem with a problem .	-4.2948
As the wind revolves around : when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , socialist prime minister looked at elections with a certain concern for Berlin .	-7.0956
Bloß no disturbances from the party central , just no headwind from the covenant - the most important desire of the electoral fighters .	-6.6345
Since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.8481
Since then , the employees from the Willy-Brandt House are watching the events in the SPD governed state capitals .	-5.8582
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of this year would not be described in the approach .	-4.6426
They were depressed .	-3.0680
That is one after another .	-2.2764
According to the surprising end of the rot-green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against coalition of SPD and Greens .	-4.6727
" This shows once again : Red Green cannot be ruled out reliable , " said CDU-Secretary-General Peter Tauber said the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.4708
Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) has plunged into a severe crisis .	-4.1420
Five months before the election of the country lost its rot-green coalition thus lost its voting majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP .	-5.9399
Michael Kellner , the founder of the German Federal Chancellor , has called on the downfall of Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate .	-8.2115
The transition to CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate .	-4.7744
Elke Twesten must immediately return their mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens ( RND ) .	-5.2792
" This must not be true ' , a SPD campaigner , when the SPD campaign , when the new Hiobsbotschaft reaches the party headquarters .	-9.5456
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is after crossing the Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority .	-5.6009
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD countries .	-3.3927
And no one knows what comes next .	-2.3506
The plight began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-3.1499
A blue eye , more no , calmed the genes at the time .	-5.0574
After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westphalia will be different .	-3.5425
It was then - and everything was much worse .	-5.1298
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln , the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the .	-3.9080
In the weeks after that , the genes were reared .	-9.0913
Then when they had just had new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg .	-3.9567
And he came the next deep strike .	-3.3678
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nimbus because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie sat while his city .	-4.6611
And because in crisis communication , he made quite wrong about everything that can be wrong .	-6.9440
Since then , Scholz has struggled to survive .	-3.3926
Now Stephan Weil .	-2.1749
Because of the VW exhaust and his role in the supervisory board of the Lower Saxon Prime Minister has been criticized for a long time .	-6.0280
Miese surveyed added .	-2.3561
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because , in recent weeks , it has tried to put the emphasis on the covenant .	-6.6436
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , the Genossen environment of Martin Schulz .	-5.7562
They gave him because they promised to stabilize the party .	-3.8116
Now the opposite could happen .	-2.7753
This is because the partisan divisions of the Lower Saxony Greens are not in fact responsible .	-7.8354
And Schulz not at all .	-2.5356
Sometimes the genes are trying to keep their own ranks .	-4.9813
Her anger is directed towards the Greens , and above all , to the disillusionment of parliamentarians Twesten .	-7.2196
" It is intolerable and democratic compensation , as Mrs Twesten has put their own careers about the interests of all others , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD Bundestagsfraction , the editorial network Deutschland ( RND ) .	-10.4160
Mrs Twesten is not because of her person as a director , but about the country list of Lower Saxony Greens into Parliament .	-7.6012
The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .	-2.7370
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestagsfraction , complains a " undemocratic maneuver " .	-3.6046
" The electorate wanted four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Weil as Prime Minister , " says Oppermann who leads the Dutch SPD as a top candidate in the federal election , the RND .	-7.3090
" Now , the personal careers of a future CDU MEP , " said Oppermann continues .	-5.2867
He asked to clarify the background .	-2.7225
I want to know whether there has been more or less commitments made by the CDU Niedersachsen .	-3.9819
Funding for local core III	-3.6981
Anyone who wants to renovate his house in the years will soon be able to receive support from the country .	-4.7877
The mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung on Wednesday in Empfingen .	-4.5581
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler gave a look at what has happened .	-4.3391
Since 1991 , there have been rehabilitation areas .	-4.8283
At that time , in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding .	-5.2413
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-4.6632
After all , Schindler ’ s remedies are a " success project " - it is important to promote internal development , not only new areas .	-7.3413
On 4 April , the government Presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-8.7075
The amount amounted to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 from the country , the rest of the community received .	-4.7759
How is a rehabilitation area ?	-3.6169
One will continue to investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-4.7771
However , it also plays a role in the planned area of any interest to be remedied . . , . . . . , . . . . . .	-7.4782
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be postponed again .	-4.2727
The STEC agreed on Wednesday Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-3.1810
Keller presented the contents of the bundle programme " Social City " , where the remedies would be carried out .	-5.1842
The core of the programme is revitalizing urban areas , improving housing and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .	-5.3853
The measures would be taken objectively , that is , per plot .	-4.1284
Finally , the recovery area would be laid down as a statute .	-4.4253
The eligibility period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-3.7113
However , until September this year , the stocktaking took stock of the questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire .	-6.9387
In November or December , the decision should be made as much as possible , so that we can start with the rehabilitation decision next year .	-7.3674
Pietzschmann then explained that each local authorities must carry out the preliminary investigations .	-5.5370
It is a question of assessing the urban abuses and deciding when to be rehabilitated and to what extent .	-6.3161
It will also be registered in the basic book .	-6.1221
Pietzschmann will come back to receiving a picture of the situation , promised them .	-4.4041
Gotzel stressed , an essential factor in the project is the participation of the participants .	-4.9224
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be able to be filled up by the end of the summer holidays .	-6.4903
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and land arc " where it is concerned , among other things , the building state and sanitation .	-7.8015
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and housing boxes " , data on size , distribution and residents of a living space .	-6.0753
The blue " operating bogen " is only to be filled if the premises are operated in the premises .	-6.3999

The green white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-4.0166
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence , and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .	-3.4757
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire-fighting car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .	-5.3515

" A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case ' , wrote the commander .	-3.6161
" Klingt as if you are closed " , the deputy commander .	-3.1636
The " Made in America " was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.4327
But official events also have political overtones .	-2.5297
At the event , the President gave a boost to the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he advocated efforts to curb government regulations .	-5.6172
The use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is not a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-4.9175

And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-3.2865
It is , of course , appropriate to highlight this . '	-2.9318
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he interacted with the South Lawn for the event , but he set himself in the driver ’ s seat of a fire brigade .	-5.1123

The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of waste , Papst-brother Georg Ratzinger .	-4.4716
The author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.9058
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen is further concerned .	-5.2890
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the Reformist Movement " We are Church " , explained to the German press agency , he expects from the former Regensburger Bischof and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emeritized Pope Benedict XVI . .	-5.6480
It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret at their own omissions or their misjudgments at the time .	-5.5969
The Vatican law " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticized the fact that when reporting on violence in the domain of domain treasures .	-7.2619
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it should be " shameful and shameful deeds " handle , which would have to be punished and in the future ; but the ' degree of medial manipulation ' , the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national bioethics committee .	-7.6802
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-4.9714
Also Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerische Rundfunk : " You are happy to go to the church and this is a dedicated frescoes " .	-6.8565
She also pointed out that , in her youth , " Worse " , was a very normal pedagogical means " to deal with frech children , as I was one .	-8.8503
It would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-3.1491
In connection with the reports on the abuse of cases , Papst-brother Georg Ratzinger .	-4.9645
To be wrong , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-5.3722
" I must take Georg Ratzinger to protect " , says Hesemann , " for all this had nothing to do with him " , he evaluates the results of the final report .	-4.1452
What exactly is the 440-page report , which presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?	-4.9765
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 domspheres sexually ab.	-5.6342
In the final report it states to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " To sum up , so that Domkapellmeister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence were applied .	-6.5701
Especially in high emotionality , punishment for pupils could also be more intense .	-5.6680
Nevertheless , contrary to many other accused accused people of the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even positive memories with him ' .	-8.7078
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion .	-3.8920
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence on protection befohlenen in the Regensburger Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-4.0463
On the one hand , many students emphasize his " humanity " .	-3.7483
On the other hand , he also appears to be a choleric and perfectionist , which became the trumpet when a dome has not brought top performance .	-8.2344
How do you consider your biograph this final report ? ?	-2.4072
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why Georg Ratzinger is actually happening .	-10.6092
He has just been dedicated to eight pages , and he is clearly expressed by any suspicion of complicity or co-wiser in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-8.2389
The violence took place in the prevalence of the pre-school .	-6.3959
It is not possible to accuse him of having learned too late or first hints .	-6.2987
The Domspatzengymnasium , on which he acted , was practically all respondents as - " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-6.9102
For example , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger , a very excellent testimony , describes him as " warm hearty " , " popular " , " sincere " , " and " understandable " , as a very good teacher , who regularly accompanied the boys with cakes , biscuits and bonbonbons and " always dreamed of children " .	-9.1262
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which has also led to anger anger .	-5.9691
The fact that he was not only with stools and the key bund on the ground , but also earrings distributed and all too freche boys to the hair or ears , he himself has already admitted many years ago .	-11.3040
But it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , were widespread , with parents like teachers .	-5.9438
Do you also know such surveys ?	-4.1418
Of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.6605
I have also seen this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-3.5636
Compared with what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and violence on the prevalence of the prevalence , are that of Bagatells .	-8.0626
As one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his reputation and role as the brother of Benedict XVI.	-7.3536
After all , many who have never understood him , still eagerly .	-6.1396
The truth , however , is that the report relies Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-5.9266
In the media , there has been a great deal about the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-5.0893
Will Georg Ratzinger be placed in the final report any involvement or participation in sexual abuse ?	-5.7209
Michael Hesemann : No .	-1.3586
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister .	-6.7613
Not even the parents were borrowed .	-2.9551
" I never dared to speak with my father or my mother , " said a spokesperson for the others , " I was all very embarrassing " .	-5.5259
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .	-3.8372
If they did not even familiarise parents and siblings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator .	-6.4271
How do the Domspatzen-pupils rate rate rate rate role in relation to abuse ?	-6.0119
Michael Hesemann : A questioned student put it so : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see a case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrators .	-7.4361
I also think it is really absurd to assume that it has opened up ... Buben intrusive or clear or even more open than to their parents , internships , trust teachers , confidence teachers etc .	-11.1149
That you talk about sex ... - unthinkable . "	-3.5667
The report concludes the very clear result : ' The fact that he was involved in the run-up to the student and / or their environment , was unable to be confirmed within the framework of the investigation .	-9.0717
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any co-worker .	-4.2792
Nor can he be accused of not preventing him or being notified .	-5.5897
There is therefore no reason to link its good name with these illegal crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-4.4113
In the media , much of " violence " in the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-7.6807
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger report is accused of " Wegblick " .	-3.5915
Do he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.9663
Michael Hesemann : this is the big problem that the reporting has been mixed and fuelled into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of Georg Ratzinger .	-6.8797
But that is , in turn , an abuse of the report .	-3.6159
After all , there is a clean separation : between the prevalence and the gymnasium of the domain , between sexual abuse and violence , and we say , other accusations .	-6.7854
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir conductor of the domain .	-5.6414
The horror pedagogy , the cases in which Knaben of sadistic teachings have been harassed and maltreated , and they were suffering from the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed .	-11.3676
But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium .	-4.9424
On that , as most of the witnesses , the theme of " preschool " tabu .	-4.4167
It was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-5.6577
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-2.7403
Michael Hesemann : As there was discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-4.6842
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even positive memories with him ' .	-6.6744
At most , the accusation of having looked away .	-5.7022
Yet , despite all the efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the state on the pre-school conditions .	-5.6382
The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again in 1993 .	-8.6977
Does Georg Ratzinger have consistently heard the ears ?	-4.0414
Michael Hesemann : No , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which even reproduced the report .	-2.8449
He points out that " in the pre-school is continuing to practise caning " .	-7.0600
In view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-4.3437
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was banned in Bavaria .	-4.3492
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-6.9093
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the actual limit was exceeded .	-6.6665
However , we cannot say that he would have always looked away .	-5.3468
That is simply not true .	-1.3761
In 1980 , the caning of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria . , , . . , . . . . , . . . .	-6.6336
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to the time .	-3.9086
How do you see that ?	-1.8144
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " trap of anachronism " , that is to say the danger of passing past moral standards .	-5.0235
The prince is right .	-3.7240
However , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was horrified at all times , and not for what was hidden in the pre-school of antagonism and violence on innocent children , which goes far beyond what was then practice .	-9.2250
That is all terrifying and I am glad that it is finally being worked .	-4.6749
But , at the same time , I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-4.1080
His resources to discipline and punishment , that is to say earnest and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-6.0409
When physical punishment was then banned , he was also strictly adhered to .	-5.2696
What picture of his Regensburger Zeit has Georg Ratzinger for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-5.1380
Can the subject of caning in this regard ?	-4.4787
Michael Hesemann : Well , in the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is to say Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , because the domain spheres played only one side .	-6.5919
Nevertheless , I do not conceal the fact that he had a strict regime there .	-5.4164
But it must also be said : without this perfectionism , without calling for absolute discipline , it would not have been possible for him to form a body of world class , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which twice twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-9.1002
With Keksen and Bonbons alone , you can make no big singers and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-8.4967
What a person did you see for Georg Ratzinger in the talks about her book ?	-5.2477
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg Ratzinger really well and always again as a wonderful , humorous , humorous and heartfelt people who could not imagine that he could only do something .	-8.8364
I regularly get in touch with how many former dome treasures still today , 23 years after his Emeritization , keep in contact with him , read him - he is almost blind - and how a member of her family .	-6.7525
Those who have not forgiven him until now that he was strict with them are clearly in the minority . .	-10.0782
Most domes are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music .	-4.0577
And that he is always a good , energetic teacher - a strict father , but that may be - but also a loving respect for whom they are still standing up today and whom they deny .	-10.3946
And I would like to make it quite clear that everything you accuse to them are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time . . , . . , . . . . . . .	-9.2940
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .	-3.0280
But it is highly unfair to make a man , only because it is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat .	-5.1531
It is all too obvious that this is all too obvious .	-5.0776
The report that has just been published is relieved .	-3.6573
Now the decency , a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without Bayerns , and perhaps Germany , no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen to finally get into peace .	-7.4599
