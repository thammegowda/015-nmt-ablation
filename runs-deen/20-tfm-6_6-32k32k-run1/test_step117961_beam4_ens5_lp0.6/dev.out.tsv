Munich 1856 : Four Maps to Change Your View of the City	-2.6690
A madman 's institution where young people are to meet today .	-5.9701
A crypt chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug .	-4.8454
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers .	-3.4647
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .	-3.7381
It annoys if maps are not up-to-date .	-3.0222
Everyone knows that , because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-5.1089
The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas , an offer by the Geoportal Bayern of the state government , are far from up-to-date - but this is precisely why they are very revealing .	-6.3237
Especially when compared to current online cards .	-2.4483
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the area of Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century .	-4.2925
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that you do not recognize as such .	-4.7026
More detailed maps , so-called primal position sheets , have been added to the large map .	-6.6073
According to the Bavarian surveying authorities , these were established between 1810 and 1864 and were the source of Bavaria ’ s first survey .	-5.9855
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.7094
Since the spring of 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-3.7770
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic reception of Bavaria - for military purposes , of course .	-3.8427
Although the French troops eventually withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of February 9 , 1801 , it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian card .	-5.2581
Elector Max IV . Joseph continued the project , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration .	-5.0112
The position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .	-5.0114
The comparison between the former and the present is the most impressive in the case of the .	-6.0070
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-2.9214
An example of this is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.1673
Sendling was incorporated into Munich as a district 21 years after the map was created , in 1877 .	-5.0565
Today , Untersendling lies in the heart of the city .	-3.2229
The Untersendlings houses are concentrated around 1856 along today 's Plinganserstraße , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian farmers ' revolt against Austria in 1705 .	-4.1213
Where the Westpark is today , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand-numbered corridors from the so-called " Uraufnahme " from which the property tax was derived .	-7.7566
Small plots no longer occupy the land in the sun , but small gardeners of the ' Land in ' facility .	-6.4517
There is a large green area to the north of Untersendling .	-3.6323
The Theresienwiese , which has been the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-4.0431
On the other side of the river Isar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-3.2332
In the original position sheet , in the area of the current district of Au-Haidhausen , one reads not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the " Auf der Lüften " hill , but also in large letters " Veränen Anstalt " .	-6.2685
Yes , here on Auerfeldstrasse people were once imprisoned with delusions .	-3.8432
In 1858 / 59 the Munich County Irrigation " Auf der Auer Lüften " was founded .	-5.1764
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-5.1306
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the anchoring of the so-called madmen .	-3.7081
In addition , he has prohibited the staff from using violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Haidhausen Museum , who has been involved in an exhibition .	-6.1812
There was first room for 280 patients , later extended to 500 .	-4.8888
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreis Centre in Haar 1905 .	-5.1295
Since 2006 there is the Isar Amper Klinikum München-Ost , one of Germany 's largest psychiatrists .	-4.5832
Young people meet in the Munich Salesianum on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt .	-3.8896
The order bought the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies .	-3.8545
To the west is the football pitch of TSV München Ost , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .	-5.2496
In 2015 , the children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built on the architectural basis of the original building of the ironworks , which had been destroyed during the Second World War during bomb attacks .	-7.1631
The Marienplatz was named " Haupt Platz " around 1856 , and the Kaufingerstraße was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.5107
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-2.5366
The Allied bombs ripped many holes into the city centre in December 1944 .	-3.5642
A large one remained to this day - at the Marienhof .	-3.8320
The English Institute , small commercial buildings and a medieval crypt chapel were once standing at the Marienhof , where the preliminary works are being carried out these days and on April 5 , 2017 the spade cast for the second S-Bahn line .	-8.0769
With the slider , the old Munich map can be compared to the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof .	-5.4216
Citizens ' Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri	-2.4880
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorful People issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-4.3738
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on African-American travelers , visitors , and Missourians to pay particular attention to travel through the state and to exercise extreme caution , as a series of questionable , racist incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here , " the group says .	-7.6621
A recently enacted Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination actions , as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that disproportionately target minorities , led the group to issue the travel warning , said NAACP .	-4.7276
" They have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-2.9550
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten up or killed , " said the president of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-2.9089
'We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not yet heard . '	-2.9144
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-2.3003
The group cited incidents like racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-5.5363
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having lost fuel during the state ’ s journey and being detained by Missouri police without being accused of a crime .	-6.2908
The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Public Prosecutor General of Missouri , which shows that 75 % of black drivers in the state are employed more than white .	-8.0913
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-3.0789
'People must be prepared whether they bring cash or tell relatives that they are travelling through the state . '	-5.3088
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crimes report program , which ranked the state 16th in terms of the number of such injuries .	-4.2605
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.9235
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration offences , which , in the opinion of the ACLU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-4.7908
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries , but interest groups have recently used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.9423
Weidezaunprojekt is elementar	-2.0543
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success and will continue next year .	-2.4051
The CDU MEPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the ground .	-4.8254
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU village association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Schwendemann family ’ s legal grave yard .	-6.1937
Markus Schwendemann initially gave an insight into his farm , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and hosted holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.9820
For him , " Black Forest Milk " is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , according to Schwendemann .	-3.3654
Only regional dishes are on the table of the holiday guests .	-6.2107
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he described the Weidezaunprojekt as " elementary important " .	-3.1850
I cannot be profitable in such steep areas .	-3.2576
The green area provides a lot of work , much has to be done with the motor sensor .	-5.7147
" We are struggling with the conditions and topography here , " Schwendemann stressed .	-7.2847
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not run a biological operation .	-5.2972
For mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunprojekt and is glad about the Leader promotion " .	-4.9772
Farmers should be supported at a cost of EUR 3 000 to 4 000 per hectare .	-3.2960
It is to be hoped that the afforestation of land could be extended for a long time to come .	-5.2364
" The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to carry on their business , " said the mayor .	-5.5391
Farmers are often critical of support .	-2.8164
A total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced in by means of the pasture promotion in 2013 .	-5.0724
This means that the area of public exposure is 40 hectares , which cannot be forested until at least 2023 .	-6.7750
Of the total costs of 71 500 euros , half was financed over Leader , a quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischerbach .	-5.7808
As a result , farmers remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pastures .	-4.1863
" The great advantage is the durability of the fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-3.2177
Kordula Kovac stressed : ' You are doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women it is not possible ' .	-4.2764
Peter Weiß also stated : " Here the best food is produced " .	-4.1873
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) of Baden-Württemberg enables state funding of pasture fences .	-4.2969
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.7401
A prerequisite is the existence of a support framework defined by the LPR .	-4.4075
Furthermore , the area to be fenced must not be traceable ( over 35 % slope ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-5.4240
For the Fischerbach Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 plots , who want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .	-5.6821
The area of exposure is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .	-5.0380
Is nothing sacred anymore ?	-2.0060
Now Trump ’ s White House Takes the Statue of Liberty	-2.1961
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues .	-2.0038
Americans value it as much as any other – hence the carefully-staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-8.4349
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta over the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration .	-3.6646
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-2.2192
A Horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have lynched him if he had .	-3.8239
But he attacked their importance , and especially the importance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903 , 17 years after the monument was finished .	-5.0598
As Miller complained , " I don 't want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world .	-4.4810
The poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '	-2.0307
Miller is factually correct , but as he put it himself , it is not really about history .	-3.0093
It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only some old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mothers , your poor , / your oppressed masses , yearning to breathe freely / the wretched waste of your coasts ' .	-6.0441
There was never a time when the ' miserable waste ' was better visible on our screens .	-3.5141
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-6.5588
This conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict over America ’ s significance .	-4.3339
Lazarus - and her friends who sought to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political act .	-4.8021
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical visual representation .	-5.7426
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-3.3302
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of the exiles .	-2.3347
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.3578
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people on the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .	-4.0803
The great shrine , Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brought the American flame to the surrounding world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.3505
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-1.8627
The torch should not light the way to the United States . '	-3.4907
Quite unusual Limbaugh found something here .	-4.3855
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the position of perception .	-3.5976
The great fanciful act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-4.2821
It is truly a question of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.4489
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .	-3.1544
And , of course , that is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-2.8810
Their torch is not intended to illuminate the way , but to inflame hatred , which is their only source of power .	-3.8462
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom team .	-2.8209
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team .	-2.2395
The UK athletics director Neil Black says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad will " make a massive contribution to the team " .	-5.2058
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-2.8310
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and the UK 's athletics need to learn something from it .	-4.4337
" We welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , " said Black .	-2.4413
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.8354
Scottish athletes think it is something to do with what they have done .	-3.2216
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2861
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.8464
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.7009
Several of the Scottish athletes are candidates for medals , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will run against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m distance , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team as the team captain .	-6.3154
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.3436
Your captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.6217
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , left the room and felt very proud and very motivated .	-8.6501
The passion and real sense that Eilidh naturally brought was great . '	-4.2558
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner , who will compete at the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Cup , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.2255
Scotland ’ s best total number of World Cup athletes was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.1539
The medium-haul runner , Muir , is on this road and set five British and two European records last year .	-4.8827
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races .	-3.5735
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 metres above sea level , is another Scot to watch after a great season that marked the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-5.2481
Doyle remembers her first World Cup when the only Scot in the team was Lee McConnell .	-4.3172
The team captain says she is " immensely proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team , but in some cases will also participate in the medals and the finals .	-7.4637
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-4.8461
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.2045
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.7756
And here they are established athletes , athletes who want to climb on the podium .	-3.8989
As far as my speech as captain is concerned ?	-2.8840
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.2748
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home World Cup .	-3.5482
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium .	-3.8339
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . '	-3.1446
Blocking Critics on Facebook : Don ’ t stand for public office if you can ’ t cope with voter shootings .	-6.6560
The father of our country knew something about bad press .	-2.8075
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to political principles .	-3.0728
He shook the criticism , certainly .	-3.8439
But he did not silence his critics .	-1.3684
Because in 1783 Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupid , we are led to slaughter like sheep ' .	-5.0018
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.4444
Howan ’ s staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-5.0115
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week .	-2.2841
The governor 's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivol , and the online commentary was full of a backlash with " Well , and ? " .	-2.7863
" It 's just Facebook , " many people said .	-1.8329
But it is important .	-0.7195
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-3.1485
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular .	-1.9381
It has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.6359
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead .	-1.8536
He has shown a firm hand in the management of his state and strict adherence to principles .	-3.5302
He was also very adept at using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side .	-6.0971
Therefore , blocking people who come on the governor 's side - which is a public forum called official and paid for by public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-8.7320
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokeswoman , Amelia Chasse , defended the governor ’ s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation .	-3.5147
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls , spammers , or hate-filled people swinging the stick online .	-4.7824
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-2.5328
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , not trolls .	-3.3437
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profound .	-2.2977
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-2.5853
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not happy , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.4031
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the news news program " The Post " .	-5.0358
'I do not appreciate this idea , either , if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , they are ignored by some more than a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of citizens concerned ' .	-7.1322
What the governor 's officials called a " concentrated spam attack , " others would probably call " advocacy . "	-4.2296
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.7591
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing , sent staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials , or arrested and silence demonstrators .	-4.5301
But that is exactly what happens in digital .	-6.2551
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-1.9169
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.9352
One of the first milestones in this issue was in Virginia last week .	-2.8507
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US regional judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she expelled a voter from her Facebook page .	-4.2664
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.2619
This should not be so difficult .	-1.7709
At the time of Washington , the affordable portal had a similar effect to the Internet .	-4.0135
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous writers suggested his leadership .	-3.7718
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.3223
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that suppressed Washington 's decisions .	-3.7234
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty , trade , and shipping with Britain overcame his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .	-4.3548
But he did not silence them .	-1.4920
Freedom of speech , difference of opinion and discourse form the basis of our nation .	-3.5381
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.4691
Ronan Raffarty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club	-3.5265
The former European No. 1 Ronan Raffarty will be hoping for domestic comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-4.8744
The Northern Ireland , which led right next year in Archerfield Links to the final round before losing against Paul Eales , is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi .	-6.2408
" I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how it achieved its glory with this event , " said Rafffy .	-5.1235
" The players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state .	-4.2046
Jerry did a great job when he determined this place .	-3.5611
He is a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here .	-2.7716
This is a great showcase for this course . '	-2.6751
The Englishman Eales looks forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career .	-4.1436
" This really feels special , " said the player based in Southport .	-3.7012
" I was unable to defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it .	-4.2181
Returning to this part of the world is magical .	-1.6512
It is a wonderful place to play golf .	-1.7280
The memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year .	-3.4946
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . '	-2.7240
Gary Orr , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday , returns to the action on his homelands .	-4.2754
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-2.1104
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.2516
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .	-2.8589
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .	-1.8221
I am glad that this has been done . '	-3.7787
With the trio on the field the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty are .	-3.5816
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field , the others being Andrew Oldcorn , Stephen McAllister , Bill Longmur and Ross Drummond .	-2.9532

Reduced lung cancer deaths from passive smoking	-1.9461
In the last two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer as a result of passive smoking . have .	-3.8748
This is the result of a study by scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UK ) .	-3.9082
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking , " said head of study Heiko Becher .	-3.8606
As a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .	-4.3640
At that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking every year in Germany .	-3.3193
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-2.0654
Domestic Connections Are Complex	-3.9941
The construction works in Villinger Straße are in full swing and " are reasonably in time " , says the head of the building house Fred Heinze .	-5.6406
In the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not stated in the plans .	-6.6925
Traffic , which repeatedly hinders construction , is a major problem for the Stumpp company construction team .	-6.4237
" The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous , " says Heinze .	-4.9232
The road is closed and only the scheduled buses are allowed to pass .	-4.5227

" Our hearts have broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-3.4192

On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were out and sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-3.8280
The frightened children told them that they should turn on their headlights .	-2.5151
One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-4.8471
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifles , said victims and witnesses .	-3.3796
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.4049
A child , 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma .	-2.6164
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day .	-3.0410
Around 1,000 young Papua men , women , and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice .	-3.4562
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita-dancing from Papua 's Mee Pago tribe , which was and imitating a bird song .	-6.7441
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts .	-3.1068
When the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead " , says an official document from TIME , which was not released to the local media .	-5.5658
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the leader of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali , saw the imminent danger and called for rest and called on the crowd to return home .	-4.2051
Nobody was in the mood .	-1.4756
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .	-3.8060
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .	-2.8098
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-1.7704
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times , so his cousin , who witnessed the shooting .	-3.7910
" I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was , " said Yohanes , who , like many Indonesians , bears only one name , the TIME in a gloomy mood .	-3.8310

The Papua police chief , Yotje Mende , told reporters that his officers only wanted to " secure " their station because they were attacked .	-3.7130
'We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , ' said the Papua police spokesman , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-2.8111
'It is about life and death ' .	-1.6646
According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured .	-2.3778
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only the following day ' filtered ' .	-3.2840
Three weeks in Jayapura , Jokowi made a passionate speech expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historic grievances in Papua .	-3.8218
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-3.1940
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism for settling historical human-rights abuses .	-8.7026
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.6188
" Most of the injuries occurred long ago .	-5.4532
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000 's .	-2.3245
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that need to be gone through , " he said .	-3.4630
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said that he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua .	-3.1140
Instead , " everything is regulated by law , " he said .	-1.9881
Wiranto , charged by the UN for ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled , including the Paniai incident .	-4.3127
Families of the Paniai victims responded with grim disbelief .	-4.3484
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.8054
'I am tired . '	-1.0871

" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.4636
'I am afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid of being shot . '	-2.8071
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.8583
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-1.8497
" After I had buried the corpses , the military searched for me , " he says .	-2.9416
The shootings have not stopped .	-1.7124
On Tuesday , Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.4614
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.4307
The man , 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who drowned when he fished in a nearby river , died on his way to hospital .	-2.7748
Forgotten villagers protested in front of the company ’ s location office .	-3.8135
The police said that villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-2.8791
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) started shooting at the crowd and killed one .	-7.6710
" We were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly brought in , according to the TIME .	-5.5547
'I hid myself two days in my house ' .	-3.2166
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be called to account and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area .	-2.9060
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian Government .	-2.2727
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the discontent of tribal Mee , Moni , Dani , and Damal , who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.8897
Many joined the Free Papua Movement ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend Papua rights by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-2.5854
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.7889
In response to this , thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-3.1222
Some never appear again .	-1.6961
Among the people in Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-3.3631
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.3518
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-2.2155
Bread is just as out of reach .	-1.7426
The people here are building everything they eat : especially nota and fruit and vegetables .	-4.9299
Agriculture is the task of women , who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .	-4.1944
They keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.4182
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-2.7103
Over time , economic inequalities between indigenous Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport have increased .	-4.2975
The few jobs that exist in the region typically go to better-educated and wealthier migrants .	-3.1690
Papua rarely have the capital or necessary skills to run their own companies competitive .	-3.9057
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai .	-4.3541
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.1952
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain strained by international media .	-2.2722
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , even though they were given rare permission to film .	-3.4633
According to Phelim Kine , Asia ’ s deputy director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-3.7676
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's restive eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa denial and a blacklist , " he said in a statement .	-3.5530
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-2.7195
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the " various and widespread injuries " in Papua , including the Paniai shootings .	-3.5089
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-1.6780
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Arrmanatha Nasir , rejected the group 's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and there is free media , so it is difficult to conceal evidence of human rights cases ' .	-5.2877
The people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-2.2291
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and pressed him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also attended the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .	-4.7464
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again .	-2.6649
" Jokowi is a person with good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , the head of the tribal council .	-4.0794
He wants Jokowi to know that , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , the Paniai people are in poor education and health services .	-3.6859
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their vote for Jokowi as a " debt " that he must repay .	-4.2914
" They do not need money , they only want justice , " he says .	-2.3988
Despite the threats and intimidation , the families of the Paniai shooters carried out a final symbolic act of the Trotz : the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station .	-6.4455
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .	-3.9236
" A member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with his lowered head .	-2.7999
'What else can we do ? '	-1.3010
Fires capture the Torch skyscraper of Dubai for the second time	-7.5146
A fire found its way through one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high 79-storey building .	-4.3344
It is the second fire that feeds through the skyscraper in just two years , which is accidentally called the Torch Tower .	-10.7914
The building was evacuated , no injuries were reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-3.1719
" We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and the shouting of the people .	-3.5206
We ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the fiftieth floor , " a resident who named George angab , Reuters .	-3.5691
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that fire-fighting units extinguished the fire at 4 p.m. local time ( midnight GMT ) and cooled the building .	-4.7490
The government said it is working on providing shelter to those affected .	-2.5912
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in the outside of high-rise buildings around the world .	-4.8379
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the facing , the outer facing for decoration or insulation .	-5.5967
In the United Kingdom , the police said that they believe that the system of panels to isolate and disguise the London Grendel Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed some 80 people .	-5.2358
No Davis Cup Reform : Continue Best of	-2.2255
The president of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .	-4.0105
At the Ho-Chi Minh City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to only play Davis Cup singles on two sets of wins was spectacularly not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-6.4749
The five-season classics , which are often very long , but also highly valued for this reason , remain the same as the traditional competition .	-6.7515
63.54 % of member states voted in favour of reform , so ITF President David Haggardty ’ s goal was narrowly missed .	-4.7503
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-3.2919
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions , " said Haggarty .	-3.4063
We will continue to work on improving the competition .	-4.4183
It was not until the vote had been taken , after many objections , that the proposal had already been made to carry out the final in a neutral place .	-7.1456
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : for example , the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the first round .	-5.5122
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers , the requirements for training places etc. will be made easier and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-6.4999
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items into the aircraft , a survey reveals .	-5.7574
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 % deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items were smuggled past the checkpoints of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 % who entered the aircraft while carrying inadvertently banned knives or other items with blades .	-5.8652
Less than 1 % claimed that they had discovered late that they had inadvertently traveled with guns , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.4376
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travelers tend to ignore the rules .	-4.0249
Of the respondents who admitted that they had knowingly tried to fly with something that the TSA banned , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % who were members of Generation X .	-4.2318
The most common items deliberately bypassed TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.2338
More than 3 % admitted that they had knowingly carried articles with blades through the security check , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately taken banned drugs on board .	-5.6267
The company said that it consulted travellers across the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled smuggling goods through airport security and how many would have deliberately done so .	-5.4766
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry smuggled goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were the ones who fly most frequently .	-4.6114
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-3.1578
People are often unsure about which liquids they can take with them or how much of them .	-3.7413
So it is no surprise that the largest number of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids .	-3.7734
For a while , people thought that the TSA could view books as smugglers .	-3.3098
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.7061
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel the order .	-3.7334
Elektro-Tausendensassa Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-4.1211
In doing so , he has so far failed to notice that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-5.6851
In addition to the consistently triumphant figures on revenue increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla boss Elon Musk revealed a different , less glittering figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance : the cancellation of the new mass-market model 3 .	-7.9405
Musk had been advertising more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months , the delivery of has just begun .	-6.7348
Now Musk admits : Of the 518.000 reservations , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-4.4595
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-2.7944
In case of cancellation , Tesla will pay back the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 and UK £ 1000 ) " Reservation Deposit " in full .	-6.0137
At present , 455,000 such non-binding reservations would occur , and Musk admitted them to a telephone conference with analysts .	-4.6625
However , Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling around 12 % of all orders so far could be a problem .	-4.7465
His argument is that the challenge to ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-3.1787
Last year , Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.3532
In 2018 - all models taken together - it will be 500,000 , in 2020 a million .	-3.7173
The demand for this is obvious .	-2.3836
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-2.3692
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , with maximum utilisation without any major interruptions .	-6.5755
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.4812
However , if there are major delays , the non-committal nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-5.1574
After all , the company will not be able to prevent dissatisfied customers from going away in droves .	-5.2900
CEPOL ’ s CEO , Pruitt , is withdrawing because of the impeachment of Obama ’ s rules to reduce emissions .	-5.5900
One day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the Environmental Protection Agency ’ s chief , withdrew his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama era ’ s rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants .	-4.0466
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-4.0864
He did not mention the case that had been brought against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal .	-3.8399
It is a deadline set for states on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-3.6781
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid " interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth " .	-4.1103
Pruitt , who served as President Donald Trump ’ s Oklahoma prosecutor before he was appointed , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .	-4.3373
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry oppose .	-3.5750
Wednesday ’ s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.0922
Last month , a federal court of Appeals in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority in attempting to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-5.2140
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his about-turn on ozone standards would quite simply strengthen the EPO ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-4.6695
" Under previous administrations , CEPOL has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and to set the date for implementation in an agreement , " said Pruitt , who sued CEPOL more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.1404
" We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.8283
We also take seriously the law and the authority that exists . '	-2.8418
Nevertheless , the EPO 's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use its ' late authority and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on sound policy and the best available information ' .	-5.4304
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules .	-3.0799
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.5063
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.6441
The New York Attorney General , Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week , said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure .	-4.2419
" The reversal of the EPO - after our complaints - is an important benefit to the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that is pouring into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-8.3483

Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .	-3.0829
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in vulnerable groups of people , contributing to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-3.0413
Public health officials and environmentalists applauded Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-2.8900
" It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to maintain this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.6373

Tummingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church	-3.0786
750 years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , a Serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tummingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.30 p.m.	-4.8941
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .	-3.9424
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz-Side can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-4.9944
The conservation and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and patrons of Tumbling their concern .	-5.3408
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village gem " .	-2.8565
In 1267 , the Church of St. Hilarius was first documented in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church to Tummingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .	-11.6691
According to the document , apart from the former parish church , the Tumminger Berg was also home to a stately court , to which the church or patronage law belonged and not the other way round .	-7.2273
People also lived there .	-2.7874
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858 , next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the townscape of Tummingen , the " mountain " was the third , the stately centre of the village .	-6.0285
Old maps dating back to 1600 underpin this historical reality .	-4.3438
The patronage law was established from the early medieval self-church law .	-5.7511
A gentleman who built , furnished and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church .	-4.9783
This was accompanied by the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .	-4.1528
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-1.9630
The larger of the two destroyed at Christmas 1673 .	-3.6207
The newly created bell was then used for the first time in 1692 , but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942 .	-6.0679
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) , the windows were cut and the bells were stolen .	-5.4642
The roof was leaked .	-1.9389
In 1796 , French troops camp near the church .	-2.8043
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-2.9211
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-1.9555
Until 1869 , the Tumminger Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from piggybanks .	-5.7936
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church was demolished .	-3.8437
Only the church tower was left standing .	-2.5505
During New Year 's Eve in 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .	-4.7746
To prevent an accident , the tower was broken down .	-3.8876
Only the existing tower tower tower was preserved as a witness to the 750-year old church history .	-5.1013
Today , Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the " Schaffigen Rentennern " as successor of Dieter Dockhorn cultivate the Hilarius plant .	-5.2552
On Sunday , July 16th , the Friends and Sponsors of Tumbling invite the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel .	-6.2839
This is created by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-4.7452
Head of town Hartmut Romann speaks the final word .	-4.0663
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.9371
Entry is from 3.30 p.m.	-3.3264
For the end of the Serenade , there will be a raid in front of the graveyard .	-6.6730
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest " , the organizers highlight the fantastic view .	-5.2963
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-2.8536
The organizers hope for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius facility , which is important for tumbling and piggy-hearing pigs .	-6.3297
Friends and patrons of Tumbling feel particularly committed to home care , as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms .	-4.7286
The Association 's Approval of Windmills	-4.4531
" Boisheim opposes itself " does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council .	-6.0069
The association " Boisheim wehrt sich " has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind power plants in Boisheimer Nette .	-5.7521
It was done illegally .	-2.1105
The association argues that at the time of its approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at all in Boisheimer Nette , since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal .	-6.3723
Within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city .	-5.7381
These zones are designed to prevent the landscape from being " sealed " .	-5.0387
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan - which had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf due to a formal defect .	-6.9985
" Due to the lack of a planning requirement , the approved approval certificate is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim is resisting " .	-6.2139
The current state of affairs : before the summer recess , the town council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; approval from the district government is still pending .	-6.5506
Erkens : " This means that permission for the installation of wind turbines is excluded from planning law " .	-5.5589
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.6096
" The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week , " said a spokesman .	-4.2752
The circle takes it as an opportunity to examine the matter again .	-4.2984
However , they are unlikely to lead to the process being stopped .	-4.6630
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court , the district on Thursday did not want to comment on the content of the arguments of the association " Boisheim wehrt sich " .	-6.0828
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four wind turbines each 200 metres high on an area at Boisheimer Nette .	-4.4645
Last year , the company in which the town of Viersen is directly involved had lease contracts with the owner of the area of approximately 65 hectares .	-4.8628
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to meet the electricity needs of around 11,400 households - that is about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .	-6.8770
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-2.5482
Last summer , Viersen ’ s City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg .	-4.7856
Car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident	-7.9809
A terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel ( Rhine-Lahn-Kreis ) .	-5.8519
A woman was killed .	-2.1816
Two more people were easily injured .	-1.9475
The state road remained closed for hours .	-3.1842
According to police data , a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich , with her car , took the L 333 in the direction of Bogel as part of the accompanying journey with her 53-year-old mother .	-6.4095
City and traders are planning a ' Home Shop ' weekend	-4.5540
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will discover new shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-4.0814
The trade association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .	-5.9759
As the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the " Heimat-Shoppen " weekend is intended to make customers aware of what offers the own city offers apart from the usual supermarket goods .	-7.0039
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned , similar to the weekly market .	-4.0812
In addition , local companies should present themselves with their training places .	-3.6187
In addition , the shops of the city centre are invited to enjoy the midnight shopping .	-6.5760
The action does not only target residents of the city and the region .	-5.0816
In preparation , commercials on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the weekend of action , according to Christian König .	-8.4458
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .	-4.1120
The trade association and the city thus go into another stage of the project " Attractive downtown " .	-5.4046
These include new offers , such as the first " Active Day " at the Brunnenfest , including a sales-friendly Sunday , talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively .	-7.3375
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiving of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .	-9.4254
In addition , customer potential should be newly or again opened up .	-4.8846
This includes spa guests and tourists .	-2.3206
But many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping .	-8.7123
In the end , everyone should help to revive the city centre , right up to landlords , businesses throughout the city and clubs .	-5.7668
It is necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network , which had partly spread , King had said in the spring .	-5.8263
Birgit Streicher , Head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , announced that five Thuringian cities are participating in the third " Heimat-Shoppen " day throughout Germany .	-10.7193
In addition to Bad Langensalza , these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-4.0427
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasise its importance for the common good of our cities ' , says Streit .	-6.3541
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his or her buying behaviour can influence his or her own direct environment .	-6.4920
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US School	-3.4186
During construction work a gas explosion occurred in the school building .	-6.6478
New people have been injured .	-1.4039
In a gas explosion in the US town of Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine more were injured , some of them severely .	-3.1641
According to the fire brigade , on Wednesday ( local time ) another injured person was in critical condition .	-3.5496
One person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion .	-2.5592
A missing person was also recovered dead .	-4.4371
The dead were school employees .	-1.8747
As an accident , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .	-3.0667
During the holiday period , few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building .	-3.6386
Trump pressured Mexico to pay the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls .	-2.9421
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .	-2.6449
On January 27 , Trump telephoned Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.8799
The US President insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall and reportedly said to him : ' You cannot tell the press that ' .	-4.9480
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the US southern border , vowing to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.4370
Transcripts of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-3.6403
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US is " ridiculous " , " mies " and " stupid " to take on refugees who emigrated to Australia , and that insisting on the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a " stop " after proposing a ban on refugee resettlement to the US .	-6.3702
Mr. Trump finished the call after saying to Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . '	-3.9966
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : Activists Recreate Racist Lynchat as a call for Justice	-5.4544
A 1948- Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and jumped to the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-4.9638
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came up with guns to block its path .	-3.6049
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield .	-3.6989
Inside , the occupants were afraid .	-4.4345
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " the man shouted .	-2.6193
'Get him out of the car ! '	-1.4984
Schreie torn the silence when a young black man was dragged from the front-passenger seat .	-4.3379
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a sequel .	-3.7523
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience cast very real sighs .	-4.8331
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-2.9985
Nobody has ever been charged with the murders .	-2.4527
" It is truly incredible that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organise the follow-up .	-5.9864
'It is a stain on a story , but it is a burden on our souls ' .	-2.6057
Brooks is a 71-year-old former member of Congress of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist .	-3.0744
For him , afterward serves as a dramatic call for action , and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.2601
" We want prosecution , we want an end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-3.1059
'We cannot get a cure and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-2.9156
A forensic doctor lays a bedcloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford Lynch on July 27 , 1946 .	-5.3563
According to FBI files received from NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching .	-3.8515
But no one has ever been charged .	-1.9858
Although the suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .	-4.1260
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign .	-3.2622
Around the same time as the election , according to the FBI , black farm-mate Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight - allegedly for a woman .	-6.2674
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom ’ s wife Dorothy , and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .	-3.9070
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to liberate Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-2.4560
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison .	-2.1573
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynch mob surrounded the car .	-3.2339
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes an FBI report .	-2.2551
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the murders , removing evidence and covering up the identity of witnesses " .	-5.3087
Brooks formulates it even more succinctly .	-3.9784
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.9945
'They were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and vote , you will get it here . '	-4.6419
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene led the annual sequel to Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-3.3830
Their presentation is vivid , touching , and based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America .	-5.5396
It is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that is the point .	-6.3073
" We do not want to talk about lynching , because we are then confronted with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-4.2474
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have gone through " .	-4.1293
The rehearsals for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - rushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the play .	-5.4371
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director .	-1.8593
He has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .	-2.8659
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-2.4942
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times ' .	-2.8919
On the other side of the room , actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.7378
The piece begins with Malcom , who attacks Hester and harass him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-5.5727
'I said n --- he , vanish from my property ! '	-2.0169
Rascona returns the fire .	-2.4019
There is a pause .	-1.0692
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-2.8567
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.3810
" What ? " Rascona asked .	-2.1807
It is alarming and confused .	-1.6285
Was I too tough ?	-1.1161
" No , " Greene said , still kicking .	-2.8385
'I simply do not think that white people said ' n --- he ' at the time . '	-2.9396
" But " one of the other black actors joked .	-2.6026
'You only have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-2.0198
And that is where energy is shifting in space , a feeling of comradeship replaces unease .	-4.6261
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-2.9246
The scene begins again .	-1.3297
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and emphatically .	-3.6043
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.2426
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-1.6760
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.4252
A woman dressed with a mourning dress stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays ' mourning praises ' Strange Fruit ' .	-5.6122
Your vote breaks on every second word .	-2.5950
About a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators wipes their eyes sweat and tears .	-4.3184
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-2.1954
A couple came from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many just down the street .	-4.4189
They have experienced crushing moisture every nearly eight hours of Georgia when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorsey .	-6.0162
Up to this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murders took place , the air is spooky .	-5.5436
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name .	-3.2175
Children listen to their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other .	-5.5521
" They are not really dead , " a young boy mumbles as if he wanted to remember .	-3.8600
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-2.3168
The actors throw away the lynch part and wipe their tears .	-3.8796
Bradshaw embraced Marbaugh , the man in suit who played the clan member .	-2.0189
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms crying , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .	-5.3622
" It 's okay , " whispers one of the women .	-2.3203
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-2.0541
You did so for one reason . '	-1.7497
Later , the audience met the actors for dinner .	-4.3407
At a table , a white couple from Atlanta chats stimulated about the afterlife with a black couple they have just met .	-7.1484
Denise Dublinski fought to find words that left the performance feeling .	-3.8589
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do so because they look like you , " she said .	-3.3867
'What this really does with me makes me believe that lynching is still going on ' , she added , ' today it is only called police shootings ' .	-5.6845
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks ’ court holds his table , eats and recalls civil rights .	-4.6745
He said he had already begun planning the performance next year .	-3.2754
" Nachstellung is in a way inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.9877
" If we do not learn anything from it , it can happen again .	-3.8119
Those who do not study their own history , those who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat it . '	-3.0221
" Twilight of the Gods " conciliated the Wagnerians in Bayreuth .	-3.5473
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf also relies on a colorful , frivolous staging in a gigantic six-storey setting .	-5.7719
The revolving stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) features a shabby street corner with a Berlin Wall and Dönerbude , a " Plaste und Elaste " logo from the GDR era or the New York Stock Exchange .	-6.1049
Before that , an open Mercedes classic car park where the Rhine daughters pose as rockers , or alternatively an Isetta .	-6.0464
Castorf 's leitmotif - money , power and greed - is reminiscent of tapped oil barrels .	-4.9384
The three daughters of the Rhine - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise like in the " Rheingold " .	-4.2233
Kess seduce Siegfried ( Stefan Vinke ) , drag a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood style and give the craving clique .	-5.6424
Stephen Milling sings the lovely nasty hare surrounding the aura of a heavyweight boxer .	-5.4221
Brutal the scene when he shot Siegfried .	-2.4460
Later Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) has to believe .	-3.2579
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .	-3.2473
The festival is celebrated every hour by Foster , Milling , Vinke and conductor Janowski , who wears himself modestly and his hands for merkel-intoxicating .	-8.4078
There is great applause for the festival orchestra , which is showing itself on stage for the first time - in the light of the high heat again in casual casual clothes .	-6.9692
The performance of Frank Castorf and his director team was eagerly awaited .	-3.5007
Five years later , if he had to go through a rolling whistle concert in 2013 , there was a great cheer in which the occasional " Buh " loop went under .	-9.6669
Director of the festival , Katharina Wagner , should have been pleased about this . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-8.7753
" It is noticeable that the audience has grown together with the " Ring " in some way , " she said just before the performance of the dpa .	-5.3887
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but has also grown an understanding of his view .	-4.7745
I draw a positive conclusion .	-2.1937

At the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul .	-2.3263
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack .	-2.0715
On May 31 , a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest military attack since the US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001 .	-3.5014
The violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Trump is weighing up increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country .	-3.8824
Corresponders say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani .	-3.7372
EPO Returns Decision to Delay the Smog Rule After Complaints	-4.1390
The US Environmental Protection Agency has reversed a decision to delay the Obama administration ’ s regulation requiring states to reduce smog-causing emissions , a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move .	-9.5306
Late on Wednesday , the EPO announced the decision to push ahead with the so-called ' ozone provisions 2015 ' and said that it showed the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-5.0873
" We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , " said CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.5168
In June , Pruitt announced the EPO ’ s intention to delay the ozone provisions – in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards – for one year until October 2018 .	-5.8773
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal .	-3.0609
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has sought to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump wants to boost economic growth .	-3.7407
But the effort has triggered the setback of Democrats and nature conservation groups , who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health .	-4.6036
The EPA website says that inhaling air that contains ozone can " reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms " such as asthma .	-4.3185
Community-building	-3.7673
In the end , the decision was clear : in the event of two votes against , the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to establish a common area in the future residential complex for senior citizens .	-4.7852
Before the discussion , there is an important piece of information : The purchase contract for the missing property was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-9.1763
Although it will still take time for the area formerly belonging to the parish to be in the municipal domain , there is now no longer any obstacles to planning the project to be undertaken by a private investor .	-7.7559
There is a debate on this with regard to a Community .	-6.6102
One of the two investors who are still on board offered to meet the community .	-3.9779
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square metres for a special price .	-4.4833
The administration and the majority of the municipal council intend to make such a common area a meeting place not only for the inhabitants of the senior-oriented housing , but also to enter the community .	-13.2225
As an example , the word " knickcafé " made the rounds .	-3.2736
The decision made by allocating funds to the current budget as early as last autumn is sweetened by means of funding .	-10.5362
The building is located in the rehabilitation area .	-3.8528
The creation of a Community area , Tjaden reports , would be eligible for funding at 60 % of 30 % .	-4.2852
The proposal for a decision , in order to send a signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a stick between their legs in this respect , provides for the observation that both the saddle roof - which is based on the environment - and the powder roof - which reduces the height of the grape and makes the construction more economic - would be possible .	-9.5519
Needless to say , not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks this addition is necessary .	-3.9477
If it helps , it happens unanimously the body .	-3.6046
It is not that easy with the Community area . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-6.4863
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings of her own , which do not really make any progress , for which we are now rejecting the common space , she says : ' I am doing it hard ' .	-9.6910
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common space - but absolutely against communal participation .	-4.2775
It sees a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .	-3.9464
That is not the case , because the purchase of the area does not grant any subsidies , but gives a real value , which can be marketed in case of doubt , is the opposite .	-8.9421
Stager ’ s request to split up the proposal for a decision is supported by three .	-4.4841
Two votes against the original programme , which Stefan Haller sums up as follows : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-5.8408
Collision with Car : Pumps on the Road	-5.8958
On Wednesday in Garath , an 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car and seriously injured .	-4.7045
As the police reported , the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been travelling with his bicycle on the Schwarzer Weg cycling route from Hilden at 12.20 p.m.	-5.8312
The senior wanted to cross the road at Am Buchholzer Busch .	-2.8670
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority .	-3.5386
When the Langenfelder took to the road , he apparently did not take care of the counter-traffic .	-6.3256
He met with a car that ran a 66-year-old Hildenerin .	-4.0228
The man was thrown onto the street .	-2.0754
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to hospital with a rescue car .	-3.0383

Seven professionals miss the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner .	-4.2250
The personnel worries at the German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday ( 8.30 p.m. / ZDF and Eurosport ) with Pokal winner Borussia Dortmund .	-6.5750
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti has to do without David Alaba in the duel with the BVB .	-4.0560
The Italian confirmed that on Friday .	-1.6749
Furthermore , the miners Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing .	-2.9910
For the five defeats in the last six test games , Ancelotti blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .	-4.7110
" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti , adding : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-3.7516
It was not good last time . '	-2.8810
The 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .	-3.7905
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.1613
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities .	-2.3102
The team is ready .	-0.6119
We want to play intelligently , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intense game " .	-2.9704
The duel of the two German football weights captivates the fans .	-3.0108
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators , the German Football League ( DFL ) announced on Friday .	-3.5580
Walking in the Harz from Star to Star	-2.3875
The Harz is supposed to be the first " star trail " in Germany .	-4.9757
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg .	-2.8002
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.7123
A " Star Trail " responds to the information needs of many Harz visitors , they said .	-5.0062
It combines nature , science , exercise and sporting performance .	-2.7603
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-5.2360
In the first phase until 2018 , the association plans " accessible installations in five to six locations " in the Oberharz .	-5.0287
They are called St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohenegg and Sieber .	-4.7022
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet .	-3.5492
That is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .	-4.0838
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.2179
Later on , the Star Trail of Zug is to be expanded by Zug .	-4.9369
" On the Star Path , the observer will learn a lot of interesting facts , such as the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-6.7060
They also learned why stars have different colors , or why one star shines more than another , even though it lies much further away .	-4.4648
It also tells you which star you have chosen and when you can see it best .	-7.4128
Since 2014 the association has been operating the highest located observatory in Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-3.9575
The location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation .	-4.3803
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy are visible with the naked eye .	-3.5626
Since 2003 , on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen funding association , there has been something similar in the city of Uni like the planned stelling--the planetary path .	-7.6493
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path with its steles leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an " extraterrestrial " location in Diemarden ( Municipality of Gleichen ) with the planet Sedna .	-6.3321
The steles with the individual planets - including Pluto , degraded to be a dwarf planet at the end point - are situated exactly at the distance and scale from one to two billion .	-5.9540
The earth thus shrinks to a height of 6.5 millimetres in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 metres away , measures as much as 70 centimetres .	-5.0796
The entire distance from the planetary path is about four kilometres .	-3.2898
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians take a good hour to the Stele with Pluto .	-3.9327
Pedestrians are therefore faster than light in space .	-2.2787
But the march to the next fixed star would take another six months .	-2.5676
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time and discuss a possible showdown .	-2.3492
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who were on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .	-3.5757
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the unchallenged World Boxing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization super mainstream champion .	-4.8340
After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision over the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the Top Five Point for Point list .	-5.9727
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-3.3529
I wish you good luck . '	-1.4520
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN .	-2.5168
When the couple posed for photos , Lomachenko Manager Egi 's climate noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect order of magnitude " .	-7.2540
" I am a former feather weight , " Garcia recalled .	-2.4251
" I went up for bronze [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.5872
I am small for 140 .	-1.0206
I would like to get down to light weight .	-2.6075
And he must move on lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.5334
That is what fans want .	-2.5984
Let us give them that . '	-1.5775
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.9781
'Boxing needs this fight ' .	-1.4147
Climate asked if it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree next summer with Garcia a date ( 37-0 , 30 Knockouts ) that also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight contest in the forum on September 23 .	-5.1741
" This battle could take place in pay-per-view mode , because all fans asked for it , " Garcia said and later openly expressed itself to fight on the network that offers the best financial package .	-5.2901
We are the best .	-0.5463
No other names can generate this kind of attention .	-2.1631
Whenever they are ready ... '	-0.9215
Garcia said that he regarded Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter , " and he might be taking part in his Saturday fight .	-5.1526
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the triathlon champion from Riverside look " very slow , I 'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted to go " .	-6.0212
Garcia said that the focus is to show strength , then boxing .	-2.2997
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle .	-4.0522
" This is the fight that must be carried out .	-2.3732
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.2312
I am more than happy to work on it , " said Garcia .	-1.7271
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.7005
It will be a great fight . '	-1.9211
Four injured after Reifenplatter	-3.3298
In the event of an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured in part on Thursday afternoon .	-3.2361
According to initial information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the Marktlich junction .	-5.1950
The car strolled to the right into the evil , where it swung over and remained on the roof in the green strip .	-5.8183
The four passengers - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident .	-2.8761
During the rescue service ’ s initial provision of the injured , the A7 was closed for about an hour to the north , and traffic on the left was then passed by the accident site .	-10.1150
Fortuna 's Hoffmann : ' Tripartite Work Better '	-3.4086
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 season start against Braunschweig that the optimisation of the defensive formation will bring Aue points .	-5.8216
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , and the result would not have been the two rivals against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 .	-6.0762
" Two opposing sides were too much and we need to be even more vigilant in Aue , " says the defence player from Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.8381
In the Ore Mountains , the Trierkette should also be further optimized .	-4.8667
And a gate after a kiss does not want to capture them .	-6.4982
'For the future , it will be the case that nobody is going to take the line alongside Michael ( Rensing ) . '	-5.5852
Hoffmann is convinced that after his experience in preparing the Trierkette he can cope better than with the four-erkette .	-7.1898
" I do not yet know how we will act in Aue , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have players who can build well on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann in the tripartite chain , " said Hoffmann .	-6.7087
'It is a prerequisite , but that we harmonise even better and that we do not afford so many playing mistakes in the construction ' .	-6.8150
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-2.3953
" But if you can speak of a failed start after a draw , you don 't know .	-4.9520
The performance could be fine , " Hoffmann said .	-3.7908
However , if we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season . '	-5.3456
His coach did not want to know about that .	-4.8792
" I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of the game , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , simply because the Sachsen game had to be aborted early in Heidenheim due to a storm .	-6.7602
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " Funkel and Hoffmann said that Aue players might even be a little fresher , as they would not have a hard and complete game like Fortuna against a top priority in the bone .	-7.4388
" But they don 't know where they are at present , " says Fortuna 's interior defender .	-4.5966
Although the guests from the Rhineland are going to meet in the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday as an easy favourite .	-7.2046
" The fact that we are throwing them away simply because we are entitled to come under the first six is nonsense , " says Funkel , whose record in only one defeat against Aue from nine games is positive .	-6.9833
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to beat from the start , " says Fortuna 's chief coach .	-4.6907
'Making such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant ' .	-2.1235
And so Funkel doesn 't want to see his players on Sunday .	-5.1057
Reviews of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment	-3.7754
Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are over 18 years old , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.9015
The Swedish authority for forensic medicine ( Rätsmedicinalverkaet ) has started carrying out the tests last year .	-5.3602
They are supposed to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Migration Trading ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-6.5125
To date , Migration Verket has sent out 6,880 testing cases , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31 , 2017 .	-4.8315
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged to be 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-4.2430
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person was ' possibly under 18 years old ' .	-2.9848
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-3.2134
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .	-2.5184
" We see no big difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant , " he said to the magazine The Local .	-3.8343
The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied over his or her age .	-3.5536
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases proposing ' that the person investigated be 18 years or older ' .	-3.9415
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the 581 published results , it found that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that she was 18 years old this year .	-3.9368
The method of medical age assessment , in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRT shots of knee joints are taken , which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-4.6884
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Carolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether they passed through puberty sooner or later than usual .	-3.6849
" I had reason to think about it and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.5180
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-3.0257
If we cannot say it safely , we should not act as if we could , " he said to the Metro newspaper .	-3.0208
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of judging a child incorrectly as an adult is low .	-3.9340
The biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 % . '	-4.2235
Fully in the Plan	-2.1646
Work on the three bridges of Landstrasse 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.6268
On Wednesday , a 7-tonne concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.3354
" We are very good at the time , it is going super " , says Reinhold Leicht , construction manager at the Department of Road Transport and Transport in the district of Freiburg .	-6.4264
In April the work began at the same time on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation .	-3.9367
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is adhered to .	-4.8373
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , passes over the Trombach .	-6.3375
It is a concrete vaulted bridge covered with red granite and has a total length of 4.80 metres .	-4.9223
It was built in 1900 .	-1.2104
Like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .	-3.4446
In order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .	-4.8975
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach .	-2.5009
They are made of red sandstone .	-3.2721
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 , or 10.60 , meters long .	-3.5032
The bridge at the village entrance of Lauterbach has now received a so-called bridge cap of 1.30 metres wide and weighing seven tonnes on Wednesday morning on the north side .	-4.8428
This is a border fortification which is also used as an operating route .	-5.0679
On the southern part of the bridge , a 2.20-metre bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-4.9444
This is where the pedestrian route should go .	-4.4557
The special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-4.9589
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-2.2727
The installation of pipes through the Lauterbach building has required a special sense of finesse .	-6.4519
There is also a fibre-optic cable , to which many companies are connected .	-11.0902
The residents were informed about the project by hand in advance of the work .	-4.4825
In addition , fish and crayfish had to be fished first .	-3.2783
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Kleingweiher in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is regulated in one lane by a traffic light .	-6.3948
The road in the area of the bridge , at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " , is completely closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach village entrance .	-10.9417
The combined cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000 .	-2.7403
It is financed by the country .	-2.5305
AfD in Gerolstein	-8.1053
It is not so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , it comes together , which is difficult to reconcile .	-4.8463
The parties ( CDU , SPD , Grüne , FDP , FWG , leftists ) at the Volcanic eifel County Day are part of a broad alliance that is peacefully flagging on that day , because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster " Great Election Launch " .	-8.6925
And famous names are taking off , such as Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the leading duo for the federal election on September 24 , and Vice President Beatrix von Storch .	-6.8150
But those who are already there hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD people , but to demonstrate .	-4.7780
The motto " The Eifel remains colorful " .	-2.9498
Originally , the city picnic was planned under the motto " All at a Table " on the Brunnenplatz , but now it takes place in the car park below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle .	-6.6719
This is a colourful picture . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-7.6132
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of the Forum Eine Welt and one of the relevant organizers , rightly rejoices : " Great how many people have come together here " .	-5.7979
There is music and a lot of food , including a " German potato salad , which the AfD could easily eat , " says the woman who brought him along .	-4.9592
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , and they are particularly present at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .	-5.8042
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-1.7736
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcanic Eifel reported that he had made an effort to organize such an event and received the award .	-6.1168
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun , but got a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces .	-6.4312
Now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.4571
With a view to the event on Rondellvorplatz , he says : " That is the right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.9710
This is also what it does : around 8 p.m. a band will provide entertainment in the Rondellvorplatz , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge .	-7.7104
There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches .	-5.4964
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.0862
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath , but there is also a need to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.	-8.4410
The police can turn away - no special incidents .	-3.8335
trumpet	-1.8817
Repeation with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli can be found in the Haslan monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .	-6.4337
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto " Black Sea meets Black Forest " , or even " Balkan folklore " meets classical German education with roots in brass music .	-4.4353
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras .	-3.7663
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo artist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .	-3.9430
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .	-3.8632
Johann Sebastian Bach will perform in the two as in a new dress , Daniel Schnyder 's " World Music " will be united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play " Exchange Suite " by the jazz-folklorist Nils Wogram , classical , jazz and free play will be combined into a fascinating piece of art .	-10.2313
This core piece of the program was premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .	-4.6385
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and even more : The Haslan monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert .	-6.0580
Kristen Stewart speaks about her bisexuality	-1.7945
" Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .	-1.9621
But I want to try everything , " said Kristen Stewart quite openly about her bisexuality .	-3.1904
'Once I bite into grilled cheese , I think , ' Oh that was cool , what comes next ? '	-9.1777
The Hollywood star 's most famous relationship was with her " Twilight " colleague Robert Pattinson , who ultimately fell bitterly apart .	-6.0511
In spite of all this , the british actress assures the " Harper 's Bazaar " magazine : " I was seriously in love with everyone I 've given .	-6.5508
Or do you think I had played it ? "	-2.8695
After her separation Kristen admitted that she was bisexual : " I have always lived dualism and seriously believed it .	-3.5942

West Virginia Governor announces that he will change the Party	-2.5453
. West Virginia ’ s Democratic Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party .	-2.8740
Whether you like it or not , the Democrats have moved away from me , " said Governor Justice .	-2.5591
'Today , I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection ... today , as a resident of West Virginia , I will tell you that I cannot help you any more if I am a democratic governor . '	-4.4399
The rally broke out in cheer .	-2.3673
" Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans , " Justice added .	-1.9071
'As a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game . '	-2.2635
Mr. Trump previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia Rally .	-2.4977

" With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislatures in history , Governor Justice 's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is out of control from top to bottom and unable to find a positive , unifying message , " said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News .	-5.6342
Coe praises ' honest ' Russian excuse for doping scandal	-2.3807
The global leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be reintroduced in sport .	-4.9064
During the IAAF Congress , on the eve of the World Athletics Championships , Russia ’ s leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said that his country ’ s relegation to sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .	-4.8889
He said he was sorry for ' all athletes who were caught in gold and silver medals at competitions ' .	-4.2163
Despite its comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-2.9267
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-2.7654
'The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that it had experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation was reorganised . '	-6.2223
Coe said he was also ' pleased ' that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction .	-3.0210
'I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the task force 's recommendations that this is not the time to reinstate Russia , ' Coe said .	-3.6281
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation .	-3.0920
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the spoiled system , " he added .	-2.7588
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships , which will begin in London on Friday , according to the strict IAAF criteria .	-5.0535

Acts of mourning in Mali	-4.6448
At a funeral in Fritzlar in northern Hesse , around 1000 people commemorated the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .	-4.4488
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Cathedral City under high security precautions .	-4.2692
On the outstanding crash , Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing .	-3.8356
However , she described the two pilots who were in the past as " experts of their profession " .	-6.0985
" We salute the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she said .	-3.2017
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from Northern Hesse had died a week ago on Wednesday in Mali , West Africa .	-5.2085
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a German Army death guard to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter .	-5.0017
At lunchtime , only the members of the church were allowed to leave .	-4.9439
After that , the funeral began in the circle of the family , the closest friends , representatives of the Bundeswehr and politicians .	-8.6864
Among them were Hessen ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker .	-3.1064
Trauergäste laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins .	-4.1065
In front of the church , Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas .	-3.2109
Secretary of Defense of the Leyen called the surrounding soldiers " highly decorated " and experienced in action .	-5.4831
The Stabshauptmann was one of the first six pilots of the Tiger helicopter in Fritzlar .	-5.2982
Volker Bauersachs , commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong , also said : ' If this occupation could not prevent the crash , nobody would have been able to do so ' .	-5.5562
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen : the deployment was dangerous .	-4.1979
But it is also of great importance ' for a country from which we are separated by only two states ' , she said .	-3.8373
After the funeral , the coffins were taken from the cathedral .	-2.6340
When and where they were buried , the Bundeswehr did not provide any information on this .	-4.3877
Prince Henrik does not want a grave beside his wife .	-6.2078
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-3.3329
That was announced by the Royal House on Thursday .	-3.0172
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-4.2262
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.1510
The Queen agreed with her husband ’ s decision , as stated in the communication .	-4.8122
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear .	-2.0874
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .	-3.4349
Prince Henrik had never concealed the fact that he was not happy with his title .	-2.4709
After his wife Margrethe ascended to the throne in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .	-4.2884
In 2016 , he retired , with the title " Prinzgemahl " .	-4.5026
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark , he does not regard himself as equal to his wife - even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house , explained .	-6.9400
It is still unclear where the final resting place for the 83-year-old will be .	-4.2356
He does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .	-3.8196
He likes the country for which he has worked over the last 50 years .	-2.0772
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat , son of a French noble family , Margrethe had met in London in 1965 .	-3.6024
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy .	-2.1134
During his later wife 's sympathy with the people , Prince Henrik had a difficult situation with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign .	-5.6479
In an autobiography , Henrik said about the first years in Denmark : " A few months after my arrival everything I did was criticised .	-3.3717
My Danish was wavering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk socks instead of knitting socks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-3.0097
I could not hope for forbearance even for the Gauloises that I smothered instead of Virginia ’ s tobacco , and who had a reputation here to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals .	-7.0177
I was different .	-0.8615
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .	-2.7342

Prime Minister Weil ’ s Rapid Reelection	-2.7926
The CDU and the FDP in Lower Saxony	-2.2273
Lower Saxony ’ s prime minister , Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the Land Day after losing the red-green government majority , but he does not want to resign .	-5.9098
Because on Friday , Parliament was disbanded .	-3.5374
Previously , the surprise exit of a Green MEP from her Lower Saxony regional assembly had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-4.8890
Five months before the official state election , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-4.0119
Elke Tvest , a former Green MEP , established her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-4.4160
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-2.3687
Christian Democrat leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that they be included .	-3.9154
Together , the CDU and the FDP would have 68 seats in the Lower Saxony parliament , the Social Democratic Party , and the Green Party .	-5.0027
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-2.0183
The new parliament will be regularly elected on 14 January next year .	-4.6379
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.6003
Stephan Weil considers it essential , however , that the parliament of the country decides its own dissolution as soon as possible .	-6.3956
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-6.3436
The constitution also provides for the possibility that the provincial parliament will deprive the prime minister of his confidence and elect a successor .	-8.5568
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.5972
These opportunities must be properly examined by law , " said Thümler .	-4.2042
'We shall discuss all the issues calmly if they are properly examined in law ' .	-5.9190
Thümler called Twesten 's step " yet something strange " .	-3.8733
The politician herself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-2.4247
I feel very good ' .	-1.0092
She referred to herself as a black green supporter .	-4.8569
The Greens called on the renegade Members to return their country 's mandate .	-4.2311
" We assume , of course , that it will return with immediate effect the country 's mandate that it has received through the green country list , " said the regional chairmen , Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-7.9557
The chairman of the Green Group , Anja Piel , said : ' We greatly regret the decision by Elke Tvest ' .	-8.3239
She deliberately decided not to have a debate in the group .	-2.6773
'Even in view of the fact that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step ' .	-4.5541
SPD candidate for chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Dutch Green MEP Elke Tvest to the CDU as a betrayal .	-5.0908
" The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters , but also a betrayal of the Red Green , " wrote the Federal President of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .	-5.1598
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to have the parliament re-elected quickly .	-3.6679
The exit of Twest costs the majority of the Red Green in Lower Saxony .	-5.1791
The politician " in her wounded vanity and frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country " , criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil .	-4.7153
" It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is playing this dirty game of intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it . "	-5.0785
Niedersachsen ’ s CDU leader , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend that his deputies include Elke Tvest in the CDU .	-3.8919
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Tvest of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 election with personal career thinking .	-5.1240
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD , but the SPD and the Greens had a razor-thin majority of one vote in the parliament .	-4.6563
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.1067
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.8819
How did the scandal happen ?	-1.6730
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.3683
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in an interview with the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-3.9053
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.7223
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp .	-3.1408
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs .	-6.6536
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.2996
Even if , according to everything we know at the moment , there is virtually no danger to health .	-4.3752
Does Aldi now have the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?	-5.5266
Food monitoring is a task for the federal states .	-2.9003
Nevertheless , my house has immediately moved on and , since it became known , Germany 's concern has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries .	-10.2733
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.9168
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are transportable and harmless to health .	-3.9653
If eggs exceed the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg , they are not transportable .	-3.6068
However , unsaturated eggs can be sold and consumed .	-3.4380
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-2.5593
Sitting production facilities and consumers in the same boat ?	-2.2676
According to current knowledge , production companies are not directly to blame .	-6.3262
Instead , they must expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-4.4265
As always , there are too few inspectors in an emergency .	-3.1153
Is it simply a lack of personnel or of coherent competence ?	-4.5560
It was the official controls that exposed the process .	-3.6758
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 % .	-3.4390
It is precisely for this reason that it is essential to ensure that such events are properly investigated and to hand over to the public prosecutors in cases where there may be criminal offences .	-7.3376
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide full information .	-4.0659
Is there really a need for regular alarm in the case of food scandals ?	-4.6778
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and marketable food .	-3.2783
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.6792
The adulterated material has put producers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-5.1480
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the rearing of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-4.3787
This must be done consistently and with great pressure at all levels .	-3.6418
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the situation quickly and in full .	-4.9554
Football ’ s Financial Rules affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris .	-7.9258
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain .	-4.0532
There will be some consequences for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA , because the governing body that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-5.8328
Financial Fair Play rules , established by UEFA in 2011 , mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without large losses .	-5.0156
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .	-3.7209
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.1267
PSG can certainly loosen the money for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar .	-10.1890
Clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but they must counter it with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break even points in their football business .	-6.2383
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.8832
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively defrauded and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-3.9812
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.0457
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a tougher business .	-3.7176
During the current three-year FFP allocation period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .	-4.3912
And , though Platini fell from the presidency ’ s favor in 2015 , his successor to UEFA , Aleksander Ceferin , remains committed to discouraging excessive spending .	-3.7249
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.0720
Although the PSG has paid Neymar ’ s buy-out clause in a lump sum , it may distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract .	-4.6411
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the amount of compensation for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million can be recorded in the annual accounts .	-5.1732
The PSG ’ s first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , along with Abu Dhabi , which holds Manchester City , has imposed the most severe sanctions .	-3.6694
The PSG received a fine of € 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million , and was ordered to keep the team members for the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .	-5.5744
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outlist their financial regulators by inflating their revenues from companies associated with club owners .	-4.8804
While a chartered company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not consider this as a legitimate income .	-5.2245
That is exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.3006
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come on payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .	-4.1719
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and such a maneuver could easily be found out for UEFA regulators .	-4.4575
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.0165
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar 's transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.8710
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not empowered to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.4230
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 with sales of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.7130
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published .	-2.3895
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising , and tricot sales .	-2.7698
The club expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-3.8499
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-4.1344
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the president of La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-3.3691
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .	-3.8095
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.0137
" As soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.3381
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because one can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-3.9934
Swiss is in search of a new chocolate producer .	-4.4581
In recent years Chocolat Frey has produced in-flight chocolate for Swiss .	-3.1518
Now , sweet cooperation is coming to a possible end : the airline renounces the contract .	-5.7869
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhltrott confirmed a corresponding report from Friday 's " Nordwestschweiz " newspaper at the request of the news agency sda .	-4.7798
According to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.7850
The products would be tested every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-3.4062
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.4789
About 17 million small red-white plagiarism packs of 14 grams per year distribute the cabin crew to passengers before landing .	-7.0546
The Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs .	-2.9709
According to " Northwest Switzerland " , industry insiders estimate the order volume to CHF 1.5 to 2 million - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately CHF 1 billion .	-5.4641
But more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious contract for a chocolate maker .	-5.7327
The Swiss do not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new call for proposals .	-4.7617
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-2.7769
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .	-2.8135
For the sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for an opinion .	-7.0343
Since 2006 , Swiss has been distributing chocolate panels on board its flights .	-2.8822
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter , Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate trays in cooperation with Hug .	-3.4365
Two and a half years ago , Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo with Chocolat Frey .	-3.5669
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.5668
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are spoilt with delicacies from the Confiserie Sprüngli , Business Class passengers Schoggi from Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey .	-4.9873
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey also distributes on short-haul routes in business and economy class .	-9.6224
Track and Field - Robert Harting , the Olympic champion of disco , reached World Cup Final	-6.5588

His brother , Christoph , the 2016 Olympic champion , had failed in the national World Cup exit and could only watch the disco competition from the public gallery .	-6.1442
The Polish champion Piotr Malachowski , who threw 65.13 meters wide , also qualified for the final fight with the first .	-6.1395
Nostalgia goes into the niche in ' Wet Hot American Summer ' and ' Comrade Detective ' .	-3.1375
This repetition of the story is also nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 's , for the 90 's Grunge era ( when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went on to do more .	-6.1913
As a cultural artefact , it is also a parody and embodiment of our Facebook enabled era of permanent memories .	-2.8089
But as a franchise it feels like time is short .	-7.4073
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a talking can vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.6000
By focusing on the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they nevertheless made it impossible to win back the last part of the joke .	-5.4997
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults who are now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the scattering cannon principle , including a reef on the Stalker films of the 1990s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " .	-5.7456
At one point , a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.7884
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.0930
The affectionate Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now novelist , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-7.1070
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.5101
And there is another villain plot that includes Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-4.8003
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.6100
It is especially fun to see Mr. Rudd , who is forever young , showing Matt Dillon 's beard of " Singles " , whose former Big Man on Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-5.3705
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until it reaches what I consider to be his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the movie premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-6.2222
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War from " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East-West wrestling iconography .	-4.1151
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism .	-4.5848
The main roles are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon Levitt .	-4.0607
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.1857
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.5861
There are some nice gags to watch ( the police spend time watching chess on television , as Americans perhaps do with football ) .	-4.2887
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game ' Find the Voice ' .	-3.4335
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .	-6.8270
There are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-4.2058
" Comrade Detective " , which has been edited to a lesser length , could better deliver its agitprop style , since Gregor and Iosef are constantly visiting the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers .	-7.6865
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything feed for gelage .	-3.9866
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong : we are even doing it with our own recent history and with theirs .	-2.9099

On Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district , Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday .	-4.3025
15 defendants between 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued warrants for arrest .	-4.8953
In addition , officials ensured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine , firearms and several hundred thousand euros .	-4.0345
At the same time , two people were arrested in Italy .	-2.4484
German arrest warrants were issued against the two Italian suspects .	-1.9116
The two will probably be delivered to Germany .	-7.4871
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.4325
In total , more than 300 police officers were in operation .	-3.5585
The Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder , robbery and blackmail .	-4.4169
Since the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-4.0562
There was a lot of exchange between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo , and the investigators of the Cripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.9084
Therefore , on Wednesday morning , four Palermo officials accompanied the large-scale operation .	-4.7538
The investigation focused mainly on Italian nationals closely related to the Italian mafia .	-4.4037
An incident in Hüfingen on May 27 , in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should also be due to the gang .	-5.6033
Appeals in the Foreign Exchange Register	-7.8823
'Data from citizens who should not appear here ' : according to a report , the aliens register in Germany has serious shortcomings .	-5.5638
This leads to sometimes serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-3.0147
According to a media report , the Federal Government representative for refugee management , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to major gaps in the register of foreigners .	-5.8799
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to ' sometimes serious mistakes in asylum procedures and deportations ' , warned in an analysis presented by the ' Süddeutsche Zeitung ' .	-5.7010
According to the data , ten million people of foreign nationality are registered in the register , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.1575
The data are thus managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.7247
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality had not been good in parts .	-4.7038
In individual cases , data from 1921 were found , " by people who are no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should not appear in the register " .	-5.8233
" The report goes on to say that incorrect data input can significantly slow back processes " .	-5.4177
Moreover , the statistics on people who are required to leave leave include EU citizens who do not have to leave .	-5.6617
However , such false attributions led to ' a distorted debate on how to deal with those who are obliged to leave ' , according to the analysis .	-7.0196
Meanwhile , the federal government seems to have begun sending refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age when they entered .	-4.0302
According to an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , the " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " reports .	-3.8109
The paper states , therefore , that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures ' relating to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-5.8734
Since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually impossible , according to the newspaper , pointing to the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.6225
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees are the responsibility of the EU state that they first reach .	-3.0596
When a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can send him back to the country of entry .	-3.4774
The Office now writes in its explanatory statement : ' In the meantime , the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly ' .	-6.2305
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.5225
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.4813
Other EU countries would also send refugees back to them under the Dublin Agreement .	-3.1694
The left-wing internal spokesperson in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : ' Families with children are threatened with illegal reception conditions and a threat to the welfare of children due to the shortcomings of the Italian asylum system ' .	-5.9793
Second best result achieved	-2.3464
The blood donation service already provided 220 litres of blood from people living in Upper Austria .	-3.5024
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-3.5182
First of all , Jürgen Greule , who now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations .	-4.2223
Traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the municipality appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-6.3137
" It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood to strangers , not to mention altruistic " , underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.6584
" A single blood donation helps several people , " explained the district manager of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the canned are broken down into their constituents .	-5.5140
For example , three people could benefit from blood donation .	-3.8373
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported on the actions being taken in the spring in Oberreichenbach .	-4.1607
" This year , we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK district manager .	-4.4426
Obviously , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .	-4.8138
Before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 donations each .	-4.2942
Half the same number are Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spend ten times each 500 milliliters of their life juice .	-5.3201
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.2766
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation about an increase .	-3.8562
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " by maintaining interest rates on family incomes in the midst of intensifying pressure .	-3.3549
Policymakers of the Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-3.8053
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % , warning that fiscal pressure would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-3.4339
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to rein in the inflation fueled by Brexit , and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.0046
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.7553
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - GBP 115 billion .	-5.1289
Minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the MPC ’ s central forecast , GDP remains weak in the short term , as pressure on real household incomes continues to burden consumption . "	-5.6505
At interest rates , she repeated that " some monetary tightening " would be needed to cool inflation and a " slightly larger " extent than markets expect .	-4.8852
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-7.8651
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-2.5760
The Bank ’ s downward revised growth forecasts for this year and next year compare to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % projected in May .	-4.1863
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.0399
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news .	-2.7396
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-2.1828
The decision will not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an increase in interest rates , and GDP rose from 0.2 % in the second quarter to 0.3 % in the previous three months .	-5.3990
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the bank at the end of the year .	-3.3469
The recent inflation report showed little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage increases , as the tightening becomes worse before it improves .	-5.2689
She added that monetary policy cannot ' prevent ' the loss of income over the next few years , but she added that wages will ' recover significantly ' at the end of their three-year forecast .	-4.6321
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending .	-4.1365
The decision comes a year after the drop in interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .	-3.5165
The Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years for this to reach prices and the economy fully .	-3.1930
Before the Bank ’ s last ruling on interest rates , calls for an interest-rate hike had increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-4.2730
Inflation fell last month from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , even though the bank said that this was expected and that it would resume in the coming months .	-4.5804
The Bank said that the excess relative to its 2 % target was " entirely " attributable to the weak pound .	-4.1785
Andrew Montlake , Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders are clamoring for deals and want to end the year in a positive way .	-5.2641
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing deals and complete new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-5.0772
National Health Service ( NHS ) , a controversial HIV drug , is supposed to prescribe 10,000 people .	-3.5961
Patients will have access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September , following a fight in front of the High Court against funding of the drug in the NHS .	-5.2621
NHS England announced that a pre-sexual preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-6.0306
He agreed to finance the trial after last year 's appeal court confirmed a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite claiming that local authorities should finance it .	-4.7433
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as " important new intervention , " while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) called it a " decisive moment . "	-5.2141
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and more clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.3268
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-8.7331
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infection .	-2.6570
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person ’ s body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.1152
Such drugs can be taken every day or even two hours before sexual intercourse .	-5.3058
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals , and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.5025
In clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , transgender , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.3292
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-3.7898
The program will be £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .	-2.8100
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as it is targeted , recorded , and implemented on a large scale .	-5.5420
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.2512
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in tackling one of humanity 's greatest health challenges . "	-3.6036
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.3178
PrEP , when targeted at people in need and in danger , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-5.1728
From September onwards , people with high HIV risks will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is genuinely individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which will improve many , many lives .	-5.2836
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.8741
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one with a risk of HIV is left behind .	-4.7829
Now that PrEP testing has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-4.0364
Sharon Hodgson , the shadow health minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delays by the government .	-9.5818
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.5607
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-2.3936
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help bring us a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.8059
Living the Great Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-3.4214
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-2.4372
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags .	-3.4951
" Before that I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-2.4946
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-2.0985
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.6905
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . '	-2.6369
Since the first visit , the 1.000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken .	-4.2266
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the spacious ceiling .	-4.9213
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.7392
That was my request , " she says .	-1.7300
To this end , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill to use the 12,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live Joanne .	-5.2035
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .	-7.5636
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem .	-3.0194
" The steel mill is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.5835
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other , without having to bend .	-4.6215
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-4.9720
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other - with much additional drama .	-4.0937
For the mezzanine , the classic Retrouvius copper light window looks down over the glamorous living area .	-5.0752
Played gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the tone for the program .	-3.5978
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-2.1667
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to allow it to work longer .	-4.0658
In the kitchen , mirroring feels like a window into another room .	-7.6757
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses .	-3.3309
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.2755
Connectable kitchens are nothing new .	-2.5259
What is special about this is that it is a garage door .	-3.2406
" A bit of engineering came in , " explains Erfan of the steel reinforced veneered MDF door .	-3.9920
'It is counterweight , so when you push the door up , it glides very easily . '	-5.0616
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.4432
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated , " says Erfan .	-3.4984
'In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on land size ' .	-3.8825
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-6.0166
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.5553
" You don 't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls .	-2.3670
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.0466
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something quite amazing by its good design and increased square meters of something standard .	-5.7370
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave it .	-2.2913
Brothers Fight for a $ 500 million Real Estate Imperium	-2.9103
Two brothers , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , are in a dispute over one of Victorias ’ largest real-estate empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-3.8576
Former Director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be shared .	-4.5439
Paul wanted to leave the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute about separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.7129
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family bought a store in Smith Street , Collingwood , in 1973 .	-3.4056
There , the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.9262
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.2291
This money has been invested in real estate , and De Lutis ’ portfolio now includes city centre offices , Brunswick and Sorrento development areas , Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments , and suburban shopping centres .	-7.6501
According to an agreement with her deceased father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company 's assets and Paul about a third .	-5.0016
A lawsuit says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million worth of property and $ 176 million worth of Paul .	-3.4248
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-7.0806
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects , " he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015 .	-3.1695
Last Friday , the first Supreme Court hearing took place after several failed conciliations .	-4.1637
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business , which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled out .	-4.6954
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of administering some possessions incompetently .	-2.9222
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-2.6476
" My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.6901
Costs rise in this case , with hundreds of pages of affidavits , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-4.8040
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.6140
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property , where Colin opened the family ’ s first jeans store .	-3.9570
Colin says he started Westco there when he was " high school in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.8648
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property gracefully to their sons .	-2.5285
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , " she wrote .	-1.8796
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when leaving the company .	-3.2543
Both Lukas and Mark , Paul says , have " become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation " .	-4.3891
Colin has been very reluctant even though he was a former AFL board member and Eddie McGuire ’ s best friend of the television star after a 2015 biography .	-5.0145
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.2434
Only Colin answered by SMS to say " I really can 't say much " , because the case is in the courts .	-7.4002
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to take our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-3.0885
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.3042
" Our father did not want Paul and I to end up in our current dispute , " he said , adding that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.4415
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.7206
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " Colin wrote .	-2.2423
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-1.6234
Others tried and failed .	-1.4322
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do so .	-2.4423
If so , he will be the first .	-1.2583
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the boss on a more consistent course .	-3.6963
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.4016
" When John F. Kelly , the new White House Chief of Staff , met senior officials on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information falling into the hands of the president .	-4.3132
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . '	-4.2735
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.3347
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.6537
" If candidate Trump was annoyed about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage from persuasive posts , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg to Politico in February .	-9.6342
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . "	-4.0027
Okay .	-1.3872
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-2.1708
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we others don ’ t know – that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions .	-4.3921
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-3.0480
If his staff have managed to keep him out of trouble several times , then their efforts have been worthwhile .	-3.8971
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from inciting controversy .	-2.4667
Part of the problem is that , in a White House composed of competing parties , people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that might promote their views on the world .	-4.3011
Politico - dealing entirely with this story - reported in May on the consultants ' preference to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-5.3872
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.5425
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is obsessed with finding out where they come from .	-4.8073
That is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the Web site of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused deputy chief Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a pile of leaks " in the White House .	-4.9078
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or offered no concrete evidence , or that in the past he had made false accusations and revoked them .	-4.2471
Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh . "	-2.5885
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff , Reince Priebus , and White House Secretary General Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives . "	-3.2833
How did that work ?	-1.3641
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-1.4223
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than a priest , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-6.0861
These immutable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.5380
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol	-3.5641
Since the address is unknown , the assistance of the population is requested and hoped for .	-7.7031
Police throughout Europe are sending ( virtual ) postcards this summer to dangerous criminals fleeing .	-3.3797
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are by nature not known , references from the population are hoped for and requested .	-6.7068
On Friday , Europol reported on the action that follows the EU Most Wanted Advent Calendar of Winter .	-7.9208
Experience would have shown that many refugees are hiding from holiday destinations , as Europol said .	-3.6669
21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .	-3.9217
Since 2016 , the website www.eumostwanted has been available , more than 2.5 million times .	-4.2033
36 of the online requests have so far been arrested , at least 11 of them on the basis of references to the publication on the website .	-5.4576
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the ' millionaires ' series .	-3.6761
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are once again at war with some determined travelers who negotiated a communal ditch to reclaim a field in front of their mansions .	-5.3104
Travellers parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy Solihull street called the " Millionaires " .	-5.1992
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May , but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council to prevent their incursions .	-4.6687
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-3.5583
Angry residents have lobbied the Solihull Council , which said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.4081
An anonymous resident said : " They moved there on Monday evening after being sent back by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-4.6818
The Council must be shamefully forced into action because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-3.7696
Travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back .	-3.6044
More came yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-2.4308
She added : " The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by keeping long instructions to protect its parks .	-4.0896
I live on Streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-2.8650
A resident who did not want to be called said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers , just to be looted by another round .	-4.4274
The figures have increased this time and we have even seen a horse in the parking area . '	-3.6504
As one of Solihull 's Council spokesmen said , " We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetbrook Road and are working with the Solihull police , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to move forward as quickly as possible .	-7.2274
In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-2.9228
This will help to create an image of the situation in which the Court will have to examine when we will present our case . '	-5.1535
From Birkenhof Goes Waldhotel Luise	-2.0466
The Waldhotel Luise will become the former Hotel Birkenhof .	-3.5521
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is due to be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.2602
This is good news for the city .	-1.4921
With the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time and revenue from the visitor tax was also lost .	-5.2081
In the fall of 2014 , with dramatically rising numbers of refugees entering the district , the hotel building was offered to the Board of Councillors as a collective accommodation , causing controversial debate .	-6.1401
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.9803
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the municipal council .	-6.7106
But above all the joys of Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and talked about serious guests at the hotel back then .	-6.6799
He should be right .	-0.7735
The Luisenhotels Group with its managing director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-5.4352
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object .	-2.1497
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.8640
They are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.3523
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house you will see the extensive renovation work being done .	-6.9869
The floors have been torn out , ceilings have been partially dismantled , old bathtubs have been removed from the rooms .	-4.7005
The entire hotel building is a single building .	-2.6568
There is still much to be done by March .	-2.2086
" It is actually a beautiful hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.9390
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.8325
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed .	-3.4356
Everything should later become " pretty close to the citizen " , as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-4.7048
'We want to make a jewel on it ' .	-3.4620
Swimming pool , spa and meeting room are all equipped .	-4.1635
You don ’ t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but you don ’ t want to be at an upscale city level , Scherer points out .	-7.6559
The Waldhotel Luise , with its 60 rooms , wants to be wide , Scherer explains .	-5.9071
Both individual holidaymakers , groups or businessmen should feel at home in the hotel .	-5.0026
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause , according to Scherer .	-3.0834
The ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .	-3.8655
'We are on the same line ' .	-2.0952
When asked about the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise .	-3.7183
Almost less than a million euros , he expects .	-3.7794
The outdoor installations are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .	-5.6057
A large terrace is created in a courtyard which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-5.2389
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt ist ein guter Markt " .	-1.7747
Russia affair : United States Special Counsel Creates Grand Jury	-3.7485
In the Russia affair of US President Donald Trump , Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reported to have appointed a grand jury .	-4.6142
The panel has started work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal , citing people familiar with the matter .	-4.6326
The newspaper rated the move as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigation .	-3.7363
The CNN reported that there are already initial subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-4.2980
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-3.1126
Mueller investigates whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-2.7819
The investigation will focus on several men who campaigned as Republican advisers .	-3.7425
Mueller reportedly also looked more and more at Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.7163
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special prosecutor , Trump , had personally put the spotlight on the charges of whether the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair .	-6.6487
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to prosecute them .	-6.0372
Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictments .	-3.6167
In most cases , they are switched on when there are major and controversial cases .	-4.9234
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors .	-2.2085
The board can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to interrogate under oath .	-5.1897
According to CNN , subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.7266
People involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , as the report said .	-3.8159
They should also provide documents .	-1.1697
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and his then campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were also on the conversation .	-4.0190
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the investiture showed that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary .	-4.4558
However , it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide whether to bring charges .	-5.6826
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the start of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-4.2708
In the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-3.1070
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-2.2798
The issue gives democrats a chance to ' feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about ' .	-4.0538
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , stated in an opinion that he knew nothing about the appointment of a Grand Jury .	-4.1552
But they usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-4.0257
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Investigator in a ' fair ' way .	-3.7983
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that the president is not being investigated .	-3.3021
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , the statement continued .	-4.6875
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey .	-2.0637
For this plot , charges against Trump had been raised that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary .	-5.5585
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-2.3617
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.4022
According to the US media , the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff .	-4.2386
This triggered speculation about whether Trump would release Mueller .	-3.4670
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator , such as the Watergate affair of late President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the President ’ s insistence .	-5.2857
But several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-3.2610
On Thursday , two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft legislation that would make it difficult for the Special Investigator to be dismissed .	-4.9132
Antarctica : Antarctica ’ s Giant Ice Mountain	-7.3784
In the Western Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg has freed itself from the barefoot of Berlin , almost seven times .	-6.2313
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research announced this on Wednesday .	-3.7524
The colossus , weighing over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres , is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-5.4208
It is one of the largest ice giants in the last three decades , with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres .	-3.8728
It does not pose a threat to people .	-2.7276
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear according to research .	-8.9641
However , for about 30 years , there has been a series of unusual icebreaks in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-5.5103
According to many researchers , this could be linked to global warming .	-2.7809
The now aborted colossus has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-4.7459
Schelfeis is floating on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-3.6409
As a result , it grows ever further into the sea and breaks off regularly .	-5.7512
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.8198
North of this horseshoe , the balance of waxes and breakdowns a few years ago was disturbed .	-5.3507
A complete scoop had broken up there , writes AWI Research writer Daniela Jansen .	-7.9731
There is a lot to be said for the fact that the larsen-C shelf is also in danger , because the front edge has never pulled as far as it is at present .	-7.4314
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and may collapse if a piece of ice breaks off at a key point .	-6.2075
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea levels , because they swim on the water and ice displaces as much water as it does after the melting itself .	-6.0018
However , the loss of the ice rink causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and to flow away much faster than before .	-5.6882
This may raise sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British Antarctic Monitoring Research Project ( Midas ) .	-4.2374
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis , according to AWI , is the fourth largest Scarfeis in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-6.1315
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters .	-4.5016
That is where it stops regularly .	-3.5089
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of Swansea University in the UK .	-4.8060
" This is the longest retreat since records began , " he also confirmed .	-4.2186
It is controversial among scientists whether the Larsen-C shelf will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , as his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-6.6893
But this will take decades .	-2.0199
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , in recent decades a great many ice caps on the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed .	-6.0528
This long patch of Antarctica extends towards South America .	-3.3827
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey , the Antarctic Peninsula 's ice surface has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.3376
The rise in temperature contributed to the decline .	-2.7185
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years , making it one of the areas where temperature is fastest-rising .	-5.1208
The CDU ’ s Personal Pet Charge	-4.2224
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions , the CDU is asking to leave the employers ’ association in order to become more attractive .	-4.7479
Just before the summer recess , the district day has given 41 new administrative posts .	-6.5190
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.1281
Now , 17 apprentices once again have their first working day .	-4.3632
Teachers in the circle are obviously very much in demand .	-5.5568
Some 620 applications were submitted for the places to be awarded this year .	-4.3734
However , the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .	-5.1554
At present there are still 50 vacant posts in the Mettmann district .	-3.7361
Among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces .	-5.7757
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .	-5.7389
The administration should , according to the wishes of the parties , " develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development " .	-5.6701
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals , but also to counter the shortage of candidates in a forward-looking manner , it is said .	-6.7987
The overall concept should be oriented inward and outwardly , identifying concrete measures for those who enter the country and including a training offensive , as required by the CDU , FDP and UWG .	-7.7412
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.0618
Because the circle is dealing with personnel problems that were previously unknown .	-6.0096
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.0789
There is talk of genuine ' competition by public employers ' .	-3.8379
In addition , a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-4.6111
So it is time to act , so that more jobs do not remain vacant .	-5.3509
But Klaus-Dieter Volken , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.7994
He recently caused a feeble surprise at the roundabout day , when he publicly questioned the cap on personnel costs and baffled the other parties .	-7.5557
People want to see all possible ways of leaving the local employers ' association reviewed .	-5.0173
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution in the short term , then the regional administration and the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the local towns - should aim for a pet tariff , " he said .	-8.3321
In this way , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than is actually provided for in the Public Service Tariff .	-6.6974
At present , salaries are precisely prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level , which is geared towards professional years .	-8.0113
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .	-3.6167
It was only a few weeks ago that new premises had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on the protection of prostitution . was . was . was , , , and . were	-8.9738
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , the Councillor Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-4.9011
Italy Steps Up to NGO Migrant Rescue Boots	-3.7755
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they comply with new rules for their operations .	-4.1009
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-2.9362
Minniti 's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German organisation ' Youth Save ' because their team had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-7.6748
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian public prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.8973
" For us , saving human life remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " said the organization in an opinion on social media .	-5.4674
'We can only judge all the accusations that are being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-5.1130
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the ' Youth Save ' boat , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.8892
It is suspected that his crew will take on board tubular migrants delivered directly to them by traffickers , and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be used again .	-6.3406
At least such a meeting was supposed to take place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Public Prosecutor ’ s file , the content of which was published by the Italian media .	-7.4730
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which is monitoring rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason .	-4.9957
Under the code of conduct , boats such as Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities .	-3.1403
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.7200
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring ' significant changes or obstacles ' to their rescue operations .	-3.8245
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Laureate Organization is Médecins sans Frontières ( MSF ) .	-2.3584
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the bailouts has fallen sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libya ’ s coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.5834
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.7211
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-2.8178
Risks and Trials	-2.3415
Nine Weilermer Biker , the " Berlin Outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy four days of trials and sights .	-4.3660
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose . .	-8.0166
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-7.2241
The Castle and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition .	-2.9711
The first tour led to the Michaelkapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-3.0433
It was followed by vantage points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains .	-6.5142
In between there were always longer climbs , for which long trials rewarded .	-5.8522
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-3.3445
Once again , the vantage point reached a vantage point , connected by " flowery " tributaries and moderate climbs .	-6.8769
On the last two days , many metres of altitude were again expected .	-5.1116
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and retreats brought welcome breaks .	-2.6842
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed healing Sole at the open-air inhalatory .	-4.5627
New town was also under attack .	-4.2349
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural .	-4.4453
Console instead of Rases - Bundesliga is preparing for E-Sport .	-4.1667
Are sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of rushing to battle over the stadium pitch in wind and weather ?	-5.3148
The fact is that E-Sport has long since become a serious industry , a lucrative business - including big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high stakes .	-5.0658
This is also recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs that are increasingly involved in this area .	-4.6979
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015 , later FC Schalke 04 followed , and finally the VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sports division in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .	-6.5041
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB , " says CEO Jochen Röttgermann .	-4.0303
He is certain that " there are still many clubs on this train " .	-4.9036
Next weekend , FIFA is organizing the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in London , where the players of different clubs compete .	-8.9015
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified .	-2.5749
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-2.2031
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.7416
" Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds in particular , that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52 year old .	-5.8811
And : The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially Asian ones .	-3.7279
With prominent e-athletes under contract , they could be present in these markets much more often online than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year .	-6.0446
What exactly is this about ?	-2.2622
In E-Sport , computer games such as " League of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or football simulation FIFA are presented at the competition level .	-5.2840
Like in normal sport , leagues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .	-7.1224
And in Asia games 2022 , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-3.2695
But is it a real sport ?	-2.6412
For many , the idea is surely in need of getting used to .	-5.7800
Ingo Froevil , too , has long considered the question .	-4.3057
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.6786
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and rapid responsiveness .	-3.1201
Professional gamers should not only train at the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .	-4.1622
'The fitte player is a good player ' .	-2.1981
Froevil also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-4.2982
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games , and the structures of classical sport were missing in the scene .	-4.8488
On the positive side , the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-4.1409
The players are internationally active , like a large global family , and there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.8441
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth in e-sport .	-3.8252
In 2016 , € 50 million was implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship , and major tournaments .	-5.9113
In three years , sales will be 130 million .	-3.1133
This is little against the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the Bundesliga .	-4.9825
However , e-sport is " not far away from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , write Deloitte consultants .	-4.4419
Many countries have already made progress internationally .	-3.3970
Major markets are Asia and the US , where former basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.8584
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn .	-2.0827
There is also something happening in Europe .	-3.2521
In a Norwegian school , e-sport has been introduced as a subject of instruction , says Froevil .	-4.4146
In the Netherlands and in France , the football first-league clubs are now obliged , according to Dutt , to set up an e-sports . , and were .	-6.6070
" Germany lags behind in comparison with Europe " , explains VfB CEO Röttgermann .	-4.2826
It is no longer enough to indulge in nostalgia and to disguise the old times .	-5.5410
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to orient the company in the modern market .	-4.5778
" We live in a digitized world , " says Dutt .	-2.4399
'It is impossible to insist that only football will remain as it always was . '	-6.4143
Gift-Eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking	-3.5025
The toxic egg scandal has now affected almost all of the federal states .	-3.6727
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and removed all eggs from the sale across Germany .	-3.2756
Only eggs that are proven to contain no fipronil are to be taken on the shelves .	-5.6351
Michelle Carter condemned the texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide .	-2.3926
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls .	-3.2882
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation .	-2.1798
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on July 13 , 2014 .	-2.8689
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is comforting .	-2.3323
My son was my best friend . '	-1.0491
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .	-2.2659
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .	-3.5741
Dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured blouse , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when convicted .	-5.6796
" Her actions have killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutor told the court .	-3.1529
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-2.3107
It has not taken responsibility , " she said .	-2.9618
'She has shown no remorse ' .	-2.0955
But Carter 's lawyer said that it was ' a terrible circumstance that she deeply regrets ' .	-4.6834
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not find out that their ' age or maturity , or even mental illness , has a significant impact on their actions ' .	-3.5943
A public prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother , Lynn Roy , who said that " there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son .	-3.2200
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything .	-4.4771
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she was " persecuted " by the realization that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children .	-4.2723
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-7.8427
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.4441
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-1.7190
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-3.4438
" Hang yourself up , jump from a building , redeem yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.3955
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : ' You have to do it , Conrad ' and ' Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-3.8307
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press .	-3.0333
The case has shared the legal opinion .	-2.5496
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British fellow Italian citizen before being acquitted two years ago .	-4.5356
Ms Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-3.0637
Joshua Kimmich : Learning the FC Bayern ’ s New Mini Lahm	-4.3382
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to be the captain of the Audi Cup is no coincidence .	-7.8746
The FC Bayern has won a big season for the Confe-Cup winner - there is no extra motivation .	-9.6081
Something else was on his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kimmich immediately saw , even if the additional garment was very , very small .	-5.7567
But since no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer was visible far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , he stopped by his arm with the binding he assigned .	-6.3453
" The coach did not announce it , " the Confort-Cup winner said after his first bet as the Bavarian captain .	-7.0336
Good , the staff could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the Naples SSC .	-4.0605
But the Coach character could interpret Kimmich as well .	-4.7191
Not the eight years old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the lead in the C-Elf , consisting of youth players , debutants and recently taken out of vacation pros .	-7.4016
Sugar is best distributed to those who have much confidence , who want to be entertained .	-7.7137
So those who have been chosen to take up the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-5.2031
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-4.7416
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old glided over the field as a mini-Lahm .	-4.6473
Right at the back , this is now his position , the white binding on the arm did the rest .	-5.2526
And Kimmich seemed like the one who can best take the helm in his hand .	-7.5986
He gave instructions , tried to steer the unrecorded force .	-4.2601
He had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .	-4.2414
This was the first time that we had a great deal of fun .	-14.4796
That worked very well .	-3.3865
Süle ran next to Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acting sovereign .	-4.7407
The famous Napoli storm was often difficult , and Süle also tried to win a few times in the set-up .	-9.8863
His colleague Mr Rudy admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped ' .	-3.6917
But he also performed well on the debut .	-4.0447
" I was also called for this style " .	-5.8070
Just how unusual this Bavarian world is for the new entrants , one saw after the match .	-6.0157
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs , but certainly did give six or seven interviews .	-3.1628
After a few brief statements , Kimmich left his new players .	-7.8044
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is going on here I have noticed already .	-4.7761
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game " .	-3.2919
After all , he no longer has to teach the new .	-2.4672
Alaba Motivated ÖFB Ladies	-1.7802
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB Ladies	-2.6388
Just before the match , Austria ’ s most famous footballer came up via Twitter and wished the ÖFB ladies well .	-6.6872
The Bavarian Legionaire is a kind of club member of ÖFB-Kapitänin Schnaderbeck and takes part with our lad.	-6.0783
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivation injection .	-4.5812
Our ladies might well need the famous Bavarian Dusel .	-3.4066
Business satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissing ’ s Tempo .	-3.4206
It was often irreconcilable , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.2882
This is apparent after more than a year in which the new Economics Minister Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-3.6772
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at the T V question - and at the same time criticize the old minister .	-5.7798
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Unternehmen ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing addresses the wishes of the economy , which has blocked Lemke all " .	-4.9337
The biggest turnaround is that of NATO in terms of infrastructure policy : the gap between Kelberg and Adenau on the motorway 1 is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities .	-6.5469
This year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning process , and by 2021 the construction law will be in place .	-6.7954
The Trier West Umgebung also plays a role in the country 's plans , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Road Map .	-6.6573
The goal is to start the route in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.6094
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competitive companies .	-6.5877
As Wissing suggested , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier aims to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to halt the trend of Germany ’ s decade-long wine exports .	-6.1922
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , the Chamber of Commerce is praising the IHK .	-5.4952
The Trier Chamber of Trade sees the new master coach as an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.9610
It is envisaged that a premium of EUR 1000 will be paid for the master examination and EUR 2500 if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master training .	-7.8441
However , the list of domestic charges for the country remains long .	-4.6459
In the planned road construction , facts need to be created quickly , while the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier .	-5.8018
Of 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to employ mobility at the state enterprise , only 29 jobs have been filled .	-6.5126
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices .	-3.4266
Christian Baldauf , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , points out that the Court of Auditors has calculated that the country is investing more than EUR 20 million less in the maintenance of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed .	-5.4965
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-4.5240
Sobering is also the country ’ s previous broadband expansion .	-4.8711
In 2016 , regional companies rated network supply only with a rating of 3.4 in an IHK survey .	-4.5998
They complain about faltering Internet connections and breakdowns .	-3.7240
Former Minister of Economic Affairs , Eveline Lemke , is currently out of politics and still sits on the board of the wind power company Pro Wind .	-4.4914
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months of disagreements she had already cleared the field again .	-5.5579
Audi is to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - Car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-4.1224
A day before the announcement by Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.6861
The BMW chairman said that the company believed that ' there are smarter options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel vehicles .	-5.1878
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.2163
None of the companies described the companies as a recall .	-3.3369
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with the rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-3.4170
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.1944
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralise exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-7.2689
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.1570
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate emissions by using so-called ' switch-off ' devices in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but which are reduced under normal driving conditions .	-7.8789
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.9744
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.7954
The former manager , Zacccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-2.7916
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was extended .	-3.6993
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profits .	-4.4216
That is the message on Saturday ’ s River Isar	-3.5327
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.9911
In order for the visitors of Isar to join us , a raft will drive through Munich tomorrow Saturday with a special message .	-7.9188
If you go back to the Isar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between Flucher and Reichenbach bridge .	-5.6708
And this is not a usual raft , with Isar tourists .	-4.3460
But the construction department wants to clarify .	-3.8042
On the raft you can see a large information transparency .	-7.4027
It shows a mountain of rubbish .	-1.7744
The start of a public campaign to appeal to Isar visitors .	-3.4282
With the motto " True love is ... " the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen as a wild river worthy of protection .	-5.8993
As early as last summer , the raft crossed the river Isar and this year , there are other actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious attitude .	-7.9785
Mordillo ’ s Knolles and Laughter Against Pain	-3.6279
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon artists , the tubular nasses of his figures are his trademark .	-5.3312
Even with 85 , the Argentinean still paints and works on a film .	-4.0290
His message : ' Laughter , because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-3.0119
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on 4 August 1932 .	-1.9787
In his first years as an artist , he was among other things a designer for greeting cards - which frustrated him .	-6.8770
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-2.7092
After working in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.9911
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.1034
Time and again the artist was inspired by cities .	-3.0986
Large , round Mordillo figures are drawn with the Leaning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .	-3.6986
In the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting at the table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.8020
His drunken figures continue to spread worldwide via calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , T-shirts , plushy animals and watches .	-5.3786
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .	-7.6141
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillo 's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent .	-3.9896
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film , which is to be released in 2019 on the cinema screen .	-5.2288
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it 's strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.5695
The script is not written by him .	-1.9443
This is why he prefers the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words .	-5.2648
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change	-2.7870
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.0719
Lavender is falling due to drought conditions and diseases affecting insects , which is a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.2669
Eric Chaisse , expert at CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change , which caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-5.6525
This has an impact on the life of lavender .	-2.2321
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . '	-7.3089
And the stakes are high .	-1.5841
Lavender oil attracts not only tourists , but also perfumes and cosmetics .	-3.7280
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long vegetable oars with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-3.9086
So we have fewer pieces of essential oil . '	-2.6196
The solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil , as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-10.3266
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary this year .	-4.3205
This Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .	-5.4357
Crams , ignites , traders , vagants or a country squirrel are to be experienced in the city centre these days .	-8.5764
The assassination of a journalist underscores Mexico ’ s growing threat	-2.6589
The weekly Riodoce staff usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans to report on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime , corrupt officials , and incessant drug wars .	-5.3734
But that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.0132
They have been told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.1031
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-5.1316
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.8332
They ask reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , perceptions and abdominal feelings sufficient .	-3.9346
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos in Mexico dangerous .	-8.5319
There is no respite from the violence , and as corpses are piling up throughout the country , more and more journalists are on the receiving end : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 ; 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-6.4670
The latter include her editor and inspirator of Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-5.9625
" The biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence .	-2.9942
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photograph of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-5.6595
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and reporters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .	-5.6121
Although a special federal bar was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings .	-4.5174
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ’ murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-4.1962
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are unconsolable and even though the terrain is now more treacherous .	-5.8067
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , says Ibarra .	-2.7962
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.9511
'As long as we do not know why , we all distrust ' .	-4.0343
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-6.0980
He managed to drive a few blocks long before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced out of his car and shot 12 times , probably because of the newspaper 's name - which is translated as " Twelve River " .	-5.7350
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it near .	-2.7977
Valdez was 50 years old .	-1.0529
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.7575
Rumors tend to wander freely in Culiacan .	-3.2102
But there is practically nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez .	-3.2187
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa had become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-3.0396
There is no reason why someone or more people are shot in the street every day in Sinaloa , or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-story mausoleums for drug kings , which are larger than many homes for the living .	-5.8365
Forget for a minute that there is a state of ' calm ' when only one cartel has control over the coastal state , with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States .	-4.0938
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is guilty of not protecting his friend .	-4.3859
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder .	-1.7127
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.3339
This publication may have annoyed the sons , and suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-4.8148
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety following the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story .	-7.0674
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-1.9986
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.5387
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $ 50 in shares .	-5.1268
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.8000
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-3.8988
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat .	-3.5074
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors Cabot Prize " for her coverage in Latin America .	-3.1740
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever it went .	-3.9737
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.7301
" I want to live on , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.3172
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Romdeviento-TV .	-3.2864
" You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-4.8020
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do with so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.4605
The Riodoce team missed Valdez , who was able to flood like a dockworker , the friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-5.3951
They relied on his routine .	-1.8470
He would always wear his hat .	-1.2889
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-2.5847
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his perdition ?	-2.4868
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and keep it alive .	-3.7148
'You do not like it when you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways ' to move drugs .	-5.0789
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-2.1827
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.2492
Trust your own instincts .	-1.6541
If it smells wrong , stay away .	-3.0902
The trouble is , the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter has happened with Javier . "	-3.7647
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as they do in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials are at home .	-3.2656
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.5981
In the space where the Riodoce staff met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly not allowed , days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-4.7869
Outside , two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .	-3.0023
They were tasked by the government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a mid-class area of Culiacan .	-5.0000
Half in joke , some reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the police that the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-5.1247
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.9614
For this week 's issue , Riodoce has looked at three major stories .	-3.8709
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.4915
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the governor ’ s hometown .	-2.9985
And there was a group that hijacked one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , one block away from the prosecutor ’ s office .	-3.1175
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened , so caution was needed when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.2651
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .	-4.1957
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre corruption .	-2.6813
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.3927
Only a few months earlier , readers would have viewed Valdez ’ s column as the most informed source of the abduction .	-3.1426
" We used to know what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , nicknamed " El Flaco " because of its slim body stature .	-3.8198
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken down ' .	-2.4556
The Valdez office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists , because the staff have become something they themselves would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-4.8680
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist at the prosecutor ’ s office .	-4.4884
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.2568
A burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests , that it is his .	-2.0927
Journalists throughout the country have become louder by writing " SOS Press " on walking paths and buildings in organized protests .	-3.8849
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gain international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-4.5809
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth .	-3.1076
She has since asked for her to be reassessed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has damaged her objectivity .	-4.7640
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organized crime , government officials involved , and an equal society .	-3.5699
In his last book , Narco Journalism , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were in cahoots with organized crime .	-4.8593
Last year , the media watchdog group " Articulo 19 " assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials .	-3.3728
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut , " Ramirez said .	-2.7241
Clearly , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.8911
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.3208
Your body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-3.5584
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head .	-2.7048
Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.9602
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-2.7621
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled ' What do you want from us ? '	-3.6772
Some journalists have fled their home countries , or even from the country .	-2.7195
It is a painful decision .	-0.8376
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.4966
And sometimes they are hunted , as it seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 , along with four women , in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-4.2569
For those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.6495
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking scares him .	-2.6745
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a reporter , " he said .	-2.4064
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue had already been finished , the Riodoce editors sat on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer when everyone suddenly started to hum their phones .	-5.9626
A series of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the bathing resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .	-3.8664
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region .	-2.5068
From the Bordstone edge you have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone .	-5.0221
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.7412
Sirens set up nearby - another shooting in the area .	-4.3289
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who kept guards to see if they were willing .	-3.4845
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-2.6476
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible throughout Sinaloa , the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps .	-5.1123
'How can you even think of closing down , ' said Bojorquez , ' when , on the same day that Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the streets to report . '	-5.8511
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade his enemies	-2.9438
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.6101
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as the " Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs " .	-4.3275
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a " restless past " .	-5.1172
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " called it " the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world " .	-3.0836
The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaur , which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-7.1733
His incredibly well-preserved state has stunned researchers who describe it as ' really remarkable ' .	-4.3766
According to reports in National Geographic , the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-2.6935
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-2.9234
He met something that seemed out of place of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-4.4754
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.0711
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth lobe .	-4.5185
After all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.4485
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has been sleeping , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-4.2063
'It will enter into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaure . '	-3.9863
Researchers have found that , although this herbivore is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank , it was likely to be threatened by dinosaurs eating meat .	-5.0228
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading , which is also used by many modern animals .	-3.8716
This would have made it possible to get better into his environment and avoid his enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-5.4503
The 110 million year-old Nodosaur family creature first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-4.1317
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully .	-3.7644
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-3.5812
They discovered Kontershatting , a common defense method in the Tier Kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-4.9159
Although contestants are common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today ’ s animals .	-5.4285
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution encouraged the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-4.2945
But most of the contemporary animals that use contestants - think of deer , zebras , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this nodosaur has been subjected to a real struggle for survival .	-6.6078
" Strong predators on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous era must have been , " said Brown .	-4.0109
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was redbrown .	-2.8711
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life , including its preserved intestinal content , to find out what it was eating as its last meal .	-4.9074
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , fell into a river and was driven out into the sea where he sank on his back to the sea bed .	-4.4914
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-3.6460
" This Nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with canned scaly skin , but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal , " said Brown .	-7.8199
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period .	-4.3287
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you just look a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is sleeping . '	-5.8322
The Cretaceous Period was a time when huge Theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs , standing on two legs , crossed the earth .	-4.8187
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors .	-2.2532
These include the Acrocantosaur , a monster of 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons heavy .	-5.3832
Scientists whose latest findings appear in the current Biology journal believe that Borealopelta was sank in the sea after death and mummified in the mud .	-5.0103
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-4.0331
According to the museum it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the snout to the hip .	-3.6374
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.3042
It contained two 20-inch long laces that raged from his shoulders .	-3.7446
Researchers believe that the armored herbivore was swamped by western Canada until an flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-3.7956
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.8288
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur .	-4.1978
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as ' rare as a gain in the lottery .	-6.7097
The more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.6827
Rised remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-5.9679
His right forefoot is on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .	-4.2207
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.6400
In the Storm : Mass Karambolage on A8 : Many injured .	-4.1547
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-4.3047
There are many injured , kilometres of traffic jams - and gaffer .	-3.9825
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway ( A8 ) , around 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the late Thursday afternoon .	-4.6619
According to the police , about 5 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) , nearly 30 vehicles were intertwined during a thunderstorm , including probably trucks .	-5.2610
The exact number of people injured was initially unknown .	-4.2639
They are minor to medium-sized injuries , said a police spokesman .	-4.1193
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site .	-3.3339
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .	-2.5048
In the direction of Munich an approx . ten kilometers long backlog formed .	-5.2958
As one AZ reporter reports , there were also massive obstacles on the back track - through numerous gaffers .	-7.5028
The fire brigade recorded the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who now face severe penalties .	-5.2313
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.7341
There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car .	-4.1223
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .	-2.2330
Deutsche Bahn : Group Testing Comfort Check-in	-2.8684
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing suspends you sitting in the train and sleeping .	-4.6225
Or you are deeper into his work and just have a brilliant idea .	-5.0783
And then : pufff .	-1.4778
Come the conductor and awaken a gentle or tear the passenger from the middle of the workflow .	-6.3065
Ticket control .	-1.3696
But the time of interruptions is soon over .	-7.2996
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the paperless ticket control .	-3.8891
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket .	-4.0719
Currently , a test operation runs on two routes .	-3.1544
" If the offer comes up , we will extend it .	-3.8571
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany , " said a railway speaker .	-4.6165
" Comfort Check-in " is the name of the train for the devaluation of the ticket without a driver .	-5.9460
In order to be able to use them , however , a number of conditions have to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-5.4218
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do .	-4.2110
You also have to buy it via the train app , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way to book your ticket .	-5.3693
Finally , a seat reservation is required .	-2.6730
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works like this : You get up in the train and call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-5.4495
A button for electronic devaluation will appear for test customers .	-4.2273
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-4.7726
When the train driver comes to seat Y at ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket .	-5.8792
So you can continue to sleep , continue working and remain silent .	-4.3554
Check-in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should benefit passengers .	-4.5324
" If you want to travel without ticket control by our train crew , simply check in the DB Navigator .	-5.5696
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time on the train , " says Michael Peterson , marketing director of DB long-distance traffic .	-4.7042
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.8139
Those who often travel by train know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the greatest annoyances .	-4.8932
Because you often have not all the documents you need to devalue your online-tickets , but in any you .	-7.1064
Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or any other document you have to present .	-5.4356
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in checking your own ticket and ultimately takes the time for the Schaffner to deal with other concerns .	-7.7606
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.1885
And only on the ICE 915 Dortmund uttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections .	-3.8754
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been activated .	-2.9170
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-3.2943
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-1.8655
Just one day after she arrived in New York City , the Born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-4.1027
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school .	-2.4771
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street , " they said .	-3.3656
Confused , because nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.7327
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline .	-3.1417
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was tweeting the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old , killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-6.4812
He posted an image of Brown ’ s lifeless body , stretched out on the streets and staying there for four hours .	-4.5193
" That 's wild , " Ferrell thought .	-2.8209
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.9177
She dropped her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening .	-4.4261
There were photos of the police band and people shouting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father who wore a sign saying : ' Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! '	-4.1231
She watched a live feed , where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellying dog .	-3.0966
In another video , she said , another policeman released his rifle and shouted : ' I will kill you ... animals all ' .	-3.6244
" This is not usual , " Ferrell recalled her statement .	-3.0337
'This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and we can call it typical ' .	-4.0531
At this moment I felt chills .	-2.4714
I was angry and wept . '	-1.7596
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.9485
After landing at 11 p.m. , she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-5.1284
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film , " Whose Streets ? " , in cinemas from the 11th century onwards .	-4.7868
It is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , of strength and of the resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and who have filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.4222
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter wearing a floral dress and a fitting crown , they talked about the black experience and the black state several times before this morning .	-5.9024
" You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-3.5642
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.3475
I could not take them with me , " Ferrell said later .	-2.5991
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.4339
She must know it and see it and be raised in it .	-3.5908
It must be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves .	-4.3756
Although I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black female child .	-5.4295
I have the feeling that I am doing her a disservice by keeping her away from it . '	-4.2847
The first station , when it arrived in Ferguson , was on South Florissant Road , a site opposite the police force , which became a campus area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson .	-5.9304
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch .	-3.8208
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.0244
A new type of activism for Ferrell slowly began to take shape .	-2.9014
" My activism has changed completely after August 9 , " she said , noting that as a student at the University of Missouri St Louis was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.5494
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.8136
Everything has come . '	-1.9136
Weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the film ’ s co-directors .	-2.5825
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.2343
Ferrell asked : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-4.8534
This skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people , often whites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.1843
As Folayan said in a recent interview : ' We heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-3.9271
Folayan had already worked with Damon Davis , a co-director at the time , an artist known for his activism around death row inmates .	-4.0408
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , and together with six other locals the team of " Whose Streets ? " followed in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-5.6143
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us .	-3.3846
'That was the main thing for me as these people are portrayed , because that is how I will be portrayed . '	-4.4007
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messias leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.1750
As a result , documents from " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell ’ s life as she falls in love and marry her wife .	-3.7083
" I felt naked , " Ferrell said and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-2.4781
'But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people . '	-3.6864
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement .	-3.0768
Two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-3.3018
" Black , gay women in management positions have carried the whole movement , " Ferrell said , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-5.3648
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.2085
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-3.0191
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-3.7114
" She was the person who stirred up this energy , " she said .	-1.8331
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life on these crossings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake .	-4.7977
You can feel their energy through the screen . '	-2.3824
Meanwhile , news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police remain .	-3.9262
Ferrell is suspended for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway during a demonstration .	-2.4284
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A Chaos " .	-2.8123
However , she clings to singing and feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-4.7599
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.0419
It is our duty to win .	-0.8516
We must love and support each other .	-1.2628
We have nothing to lose except our chains . '	-2.0309
From " Dream " to " megalomania " : TV readers discuss Bit Gallery .	-2.6661
The Bit Gallery moves people , although it is far from built .	-3.7811
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-3.3103
Cold does not leave the issue at all .	-4.9184
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.3978
While some say to the Bit Gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be real class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , comes from the other side : " No man needs " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply " megalomania ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-4.8974
While the proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , benefiting the rest of the shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding out .	-7.2273
In addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the site where the Bauernmarkthalle stands , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-5.5729
This will end with the start of construction work .	-3.8737
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside .	-4.6027
Simone Zimmer : " We have been buying in the farmer 's market hall almost weekly for many years .	-5.0311
Most of all our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are always .	-5.6151
We have also discovered the butchery for us .	-3.2627
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the building of the gallery .	-4.4177
Other cities do .	-2.8898
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is particularly interesting . '	-2.5024
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery is up to the rent .	-3.5225
However , this should not be particularly low in the new project . '	-4.9953
Eva Kilic : " Why shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.9405
Whether clothing , shoes , drugstore or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-4.4961
There is enough of this in our city .	-3.3866
You can see how many shops there are empty - some for months and years .	-3.8103
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall .	-4.2793
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , most of which are offered directly by the producer and are also cheap .	-5.4406
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer .	-5.9145
It is a pity that special deals are almost non-existent , and what remains of them will disappear . '	-5.9705
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me .	-2.6421
And the gallery doesn 't fit into Bitburg .	-2.0619
Above all , where should the farmer 's market hall go during construction ?	-5.0919
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the Bit Gallery actually comes at some point .	-3.5313
Or does the Ghost Bit Gallery manage to expel all shops from Bitburg beforehand ? "	-4.4951
George Marquet : " It just won 't work .	-2.2531
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-2.4713
In my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farming market instead of this gallery .	-3.7795
However , thanks to the insane number of - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg , there is no room for a farmers ' market hall .	-5.8594
If the Farmers ' Market Hall is destroyed , a bit of culture will disappear . '	-4.3912
A fitting similarity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning ’ s DNA .	-3.1447
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost imperceptibly similar - which hang on cables from the ceiling .	-4.8686
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Thrrafters and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-4.5963
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publishing classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website .	-4.1150
The new exhibition , opened on August 2 , is called A Becoming Remembrance .	-2.9168
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and Manning , a translocent and groundbreaking dissident , whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he was in office for only three days .	-9.3897
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits were created , how someone could look with these genomic data , has created a sharp , if somewhat intellectual , comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.5312
Manning , born Bradley Edward , but having spoken openly about female identification since her puberty , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six breaches of the espionage law , computer fraud , and theft .	-8.0010
Her image was suppressed by the prison , so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy , black-and-white selfie , in which manning visibly sits on a driver 's seat and wears a platinblond wig - with which she was associated .	-6.0855
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.9549
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gums by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like .	-5.5978
This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine .	-2.9886
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.7093
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so contact Chelsea and ask her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-4.8318
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal postmates who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-5.0963
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's verdict would be transformed and it would be able to see the exhibition in person .	-4.9535
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy encounter .	-3.6707
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against whistle-blowers from the government camp and transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to resolve .	-6.3112
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that ' things happen for a particular reason ' .	-2.5956
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for an end to ' automatic fragmentation based on gender , race , sexuality and culture ' with her oversized signature ( the " i " in her family name is marked with a heart ) .	-5.5171
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-footer of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-3.8110
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how remarkably similar , at least in biological terms , we are all by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the artist ’ s advanced scientific lexicon ) .	-3.6548
" Hopefully , what people will take with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose 2007 video work , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-4.8612
'DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . '	-2.5214
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the aforementioned comic novel .	-4.6826
She shows Manning as she appears with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong .	-5.1413
" When they cold off your speech , then they won , " it says .	-4.4903
'So never shut up ' .	-6.1160
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist , who greet her from Philadelphia .	-3.7233
'I still get goose bumps when I talk about it ' .	-2.9761
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally yet - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do so , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , by its own genomic simulacons , which gather together like hordes of protesters .	-6.8452
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings stature ) where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-8.6594
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.6167
'I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement behind its liberation . '	-2.6996
Looking for Professor of Northwestern University and a University employee for Killing	-3.7565
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is being sought as a suspect after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .	-4.4851
On Monday , arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) for murder for alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as the files of the Local Court of Cook County show .	-4.9052
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several engravings .	-1.9469
A Community alert system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the body was discovered on July 27 .	-3.6203
Officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.8683
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead in the scene , and detectives investigate the stitches as murder , while the police actively seek the two suspects , officials said .	-4.7137
Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-3.0986
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice President of University Relations , said in an email statement that Lathem has now been in jail and has been barred from entering the Northwestern University campus .	-5.9645
" This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University is cooperating on this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-4.0390
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.9260
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that ' we are in contact with the UK police and are prepared to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible ' .	-5.3117
Warren 's colleagues were shocked , and wanted him to stand up .	-8.5143
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office , Anthony Guglielmi , said he urged suspects to confront the authorities .	-3.1266
" The police have an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them are reinforcing , " said Guglielmi .	-3.3163
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-5.7265
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008 .	-4.5125
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.9809
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July .	-2.7984
It was confirmed by security cameras that Latem and Warren were in the building .	-2.8635
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " Guglielmi said .	-1.9014
The management team at Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents : ' The police are currently working on the time axis and the victim 's background and are investigating a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident ' .	-5.2854
'We will complete the WADA road map in the near future ' - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko	-3.3221
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) are implemented .	-3.4543
" At a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.8044
The WADA timetable has been updated in this regard , " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-2.7808
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA ’ s compliance roadmap , which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation ’ s website .	-4.6306
According to Mutko , it does not contain anything that could give Russia cause for concern .	-3.0168
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-6.9468
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.6677
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.0003
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : " We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has acknowledged a mistake .	-4.1452
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.3540
But there were no government programs and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-5.7989
Mutko ’ s words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of Russia ’ s independent anti-doping commission .	-3.1569
In talks with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules .	-8.9519
No one wants to accept this report unconditionally , " added Smirnov .	-2.1738
In November 2015 , following the doping scandal , RUSADA was excluded from conducting doping checks in Russia .	-4.3393
However , it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.5339
After visiting the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving " in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-4.3854
Aldi is no longer selling eggs .	-2.6144
This was shared by the business groups .	-3.6559
The communication said that this was a purely precautionary measure , that it could no longer be assumed that health was not affected .	-7.3302
From now on , only eggs that have been proven to have been negatively tested for anti-fipronic agents are likely to be delivered to Aldi .	-5.4980
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for his customers .	-3.9151
The Start-Ups that will help your business not become the next Uber .	-3.5408
Amy Erett wanted to measure the happiness of your employees at your e-commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .	-8.1527
Answers have often been vague , unhelpful or , worse still , fraudulent .	-2.3584
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.6582
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Erett , who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .	-6.0624
It has called for help from outside .	-2.0282
A new breed of human resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.0723
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines , and , in some cases , allow whistleblowers to bypass C-Suite executives and turn directly to the board of directors .	-5.5624
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health , but where is the fit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .	-3.4126
Erett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-3.9517
In addition to snap-surveys and surveys by certain teams , it offers a hot card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so you can follow why .	-6.0153
Companies come to realise that they must remain at the forefront of the workplace culture , so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished .	-10.0778
For starters like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-3.8075
The global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial website Let 's Talk Payments .	-2.6734
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit .	-7.2322
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.5615
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-2.5212
Like Glint , Convercent lets companies send tailored " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time , and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-4.4124
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.5090
And if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the supervisory board .	-2.4177
" The court of public opinion has captured regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and CEO of Convercent .	-3.1799
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott , employee fluctuation and complaints , said Quinlan .	-5.0301
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .	-4.2581
Previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously .	-4.1022
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said there was no good way to prosecute the complaints of employees .	-3.0663
Now that the company is using Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states – such as discrimination , harassment , or dishonest internships – can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-7.9863
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday .	-4.1916
" And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation . "	-3.5074
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.5806
But it took the " social media to get it right " for companies to recognize that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online .	-4.7831
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.4063
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring fees for using their products .	-3.6267
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups .	-3.6897
Convercent received $ 10 million in February financing from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-3.2647
Glitzern secured $ 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November , bringing its total financing to $ 60 million .	-2.7128
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.8999
There is a growing set of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-5.1128
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-2.2160
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.7339
" If people are happy to be in a company that heard their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.4790
Investors get returns when their portfolio companies are doing well , and companies when and are committed .	-8.5450
When third-party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.5151
The data on employee involvement according to the experts of the workplace culture important .	-3.4492
But the data are useless if a company ’ s managers do not take action .	-2.9951
In fact , if a company employee asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.5312
And if change does not come quickly enough , or at all , it can generate disappointment and discourage employees .	-4.3303
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that rely too much on data collection .	-4.3182
" For if you do not follow employees will ask themselves , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.4476
Do you care about this ?	-2.0965
And who do not care about it , why should I ? " . . . . . . . . . . .	-7.1230
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , says Erett .	-5.1270
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-4.7647
At Ruby Tuesday , the company gets new insights about its employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-5.7178
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-2.1468
" And if you lose people , you lose customers .	-2.0970
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.1847
The NCAA Eliminates the Two Days Practices and Is a Long Day for the Bru	-4.2994
It is scheduled for 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA soccer players will be talking on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .	-6.8608
Some have removed their tricot parts and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-3.9587
For a good part of the team these idle minutes are a lunch break .	-3.4201
Players enrolled in summer courses will return to their final exams after three hours of practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6 : 30 the next morning .	-4.7167
" This is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-6.9947
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-3.6611
Therefore , the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7 : 15 to match the players ' already packed schedules .	-6.8852
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day on which the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora 's six seasons in Westwood .	-6.1226
They are expected to perform 18 exercises during the course of August , 20 before the formal preparation for their start to Texas A & M in September .	-6.2308
Mora said that he supported the NCAA ’ s rule change , even if it adds another point to players ’ busy routes .	-4.5195
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " Mora said .	-2.8385
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to flare , they are great people .	-4.5170
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-3.4570
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which , given the clear lines of view of its fields , will not be an easy task , from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center , an upscale hotel that has already been guarded with footballs that cleared a safety net behind a goalpost .	-10.8409
Bruin players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are available during the season .	-4.4819
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.1319
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to record an exercise .	-4.0498
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is quite a good deal .	-2.4114
But we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8 .	-2.1798
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.5083
I am therefore not too concerned .	-3.0851
We have a plan . '	-1.0133
Facebook ’ s Fixing Facts	-3.2761
Facebook wants to send more potential items with fake reports to third-party fact-auditors and then display their results under the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday .	-6.6300
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible misreporting and send it to fact-checking experts who may display results from the original article .	-6.5508
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-3.5599
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings , as they did before the September elections .	-4.8632
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-7.5758
" Besides recognizing what stories are challenged by third-party fact-checking experts , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news on a blog .	-5.0311
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the " related article " and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages .	-3.7272
Creating a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.4778
In his recent past , Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.9322
But Scotney has had 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent , and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaaric Yorkshire with a love for historical documents .	-5.6240
" I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says woefully .	-3.9349
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands ' .	-2.1782
A Castle in England spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotland .	-4.3339
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional .	-3.5311
" I only reacted to the thumb-print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 's who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-4.4450
" That 's his thumb-print !	-3.2485
And letters always smelt of smoke , because at that time a fire was lit because of the light .	-4.6171
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there .	-3.6914
Oh , I love archives ! '	-0.8484
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( " To be honest , I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting " ) , all this seems too good to be true .	-6.0163
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , visiting the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted hyanide heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch .	-5.4854
He strolled through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-8.4850
Then , at night he drank " whiskey and began to write " .	-1.9608
Scotney 's intimate history is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-4.4315
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees only began to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the roof . "	-4.9283
Diaries , letters from the time of English Empires , maps showing who owned what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight for the two families .	-5.2339
Guys , let everything go ! '	-3.5809
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 peasant uprising .	-5.3821
" There is a record of a rebellion that appeared in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.5454
" The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-2.9678
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-2.2170
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle , such as The Priest , which tells the story of the Jesuit priest , whom the Darrell family hid during the English Reformation for seven years .	-4.5080
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which depicts the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell , who staged his own burial by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-3.8404
The Darrells are Scotney 's favourite family of Rhodes : " The lords seemed to be quite crooks , repeatedly making debt and spending money on things they could not afford .	-5.9353
Other generations of Darrell men resolved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to recruit heirs . "	-4.4007
After the castle ’ s deployment , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-4.2735
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki , the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature .	-4.1942
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.4193
" I was sad to go back , " he says .	-1.5620
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to deal with the damned life again ' .	-3.6956
Launched Campaign : Covered over 300-year-old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf	-3.6985
On Friday , the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign for the introduction of a new roof brand ( Thursday ’ s round show ) with the unveiling of the 301 year old Marien Chapel in Rhöndorf .	-6.9786
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .	-2.6372
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight .	-4.2261
" Too good for us .	-2.7024
Or ? " , the organizers of the event have been asking on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel since yesterday .	-5.7683
" We don 't think this ( of course ! ) really , " they write on their yesterday released website .	-5.3667
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-2.0113
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem .	-2.5353
In fact , we firmly believe that , as Bad Honnefer , we citizens are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.2287
The action is about more than " only " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-6.4990
" It is important to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling proposition " .	-5.5768
After all , they compete with other municipalities .	-2.4712
The city of Bad Honnef can cost an average five-digit amount of its new roof brand and campaign .	-5.5157
Military Reform in Turkey - Erdogan 's Fear of the Army	-1.5643
Every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps .	-4.0267
So this week .	-2.4756
At first glance a normal procedure .	-2.0804
But nothing is routine for the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.6499
The meeting took place not in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .	-4.1841
The five Vice-Presidents , as well as the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs , took part in the discussions under the presidency of the Heads of Government .	-5.0222
As a result , civilians in the YAS were in large numbers .	-4.4119
The government is taking the reins in the military .	-3.3354
Chief of Staff , Hulusi Akar , remains in office , but the commanders of the army , the air force and the navy have been deposed .	-4.3421
Since the failed coup , leader Erdogan 169 has fired from the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.1810
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army , mostly because of alleged ties to the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen ’ s movement , which Erdogan sees as the instigator of the coup attempt .	-5.2873
Some 486 people who were alleged to have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been under negotiation in Ankara since this week .	-4.7363
Already the day after the coup , Erdogan called the coup attempt a " gift of God , " giving him the opportunity to " cleanse the armed forces completely " .	-5.0165
But does Erdogan really control the army ?	-2.1557
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Uneasiness in the Military Headquarters " .	-2.9940
In the General Staff , there are concerns about the increasing ' Islamisation ' of the army , which is manifested , among other things , in the lifting of the ban on women soldiers ' headscarves , the newspaper wrote .	-5.9436
In any case , the heavy cleaning of the army and the security forces continues .	-4.5209
In mid-July , Erdoğan ordered a further 7395 civil servants to fire , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.1587
Erdogan seemed to have tamed the military .	-2.7597
The generals used to be the real masters of the country .	-2.7121
Three times , they acted as guardians of the secular state .	-5.4322
Following his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reforms .	-5.1162
Former officers say that Erdogan is pushing ahead with Islamicization of the armed forces .	-3.3806
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the attempted coup for fear of persecution abroad warned that in a few years the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and salafists " .	-5.1145
If that is the case , such a development would not leave NATO cold .	-5.7768
In any case , following the purges , there are doubts in the Alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army to act .	-4.9234
The governance structures and operational capabilities are ' weakened ' , say NATO diplomats .	-3.3120
Washington ’ s Green Card Rules	-2.0700
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-2.2224
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas .	-4.5149
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.7892
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .	-2.8425
'This law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and it will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries spend Green Cards . '	-4.6574
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.3016
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-4.2117
The Ministry wants to Restore Track for Road Riders	-6.0243
Over the past few months , the future of the race platform hat has been the subject of constant controversy - now it is to be done very quickly .	-9.4823
Before the end of the year , the construction will take place on the ramified route on which the tourist railway runs .	-7.0169
According to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the track will begin this year in order to secure the future of the race platform hat in the long term .	-6.6037
" With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country is committed to this link , which is particularly important for tourism , " explained Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-5.3880
It put the cost of repairing the route at around EUR 2.5 million .	-3.5225
The country receives 75 % of this sum .	-3.5300
The shuttlecraft , which was to be ordered by the country in the future , is now being finally voted on , explained Sühl .	-9.6656
The Ministry and the Südtschüringen Railway as operators already agree on the technical details .	-4.0399
" The road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , " said Sühl .	-3.6106
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for eleven years .	-5.1308
This means that the race platform shuttle should be ordered as regular on December 2017 .	-5.2402
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations , especially for tourists .	-4.3035
In recent months , a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by a sufficient number of people to order it again in future .	-5.8323
The route is also highly dilapidated in parts .	-4.0488
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry .	-2.2062
Just when you thought that things could not get even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the sex robot sector comes .	-5.2374
Yes , indeed .	-0.9893
Sex-robots are a big thing at the moment .	-3.2079
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.1814
According to Noel Sharkey , an emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-3.1140
Customers can choose the robot 's eye color , its shape of chest and the type of fingernail .	-4.1312
'People are making fun of them , but companies are delivering a lot of them and we will see them much more often ' , said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-5.3795
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm , with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-4.2214
The user can also " customize " his robot according to his convictions , choosing everything from the robot 's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails .	-5.0750
But it becomes even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " who would make a Stepford woman look progressive .	-4.1988
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.2317
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as shyness .	-5.7846
Then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion , with pre-programmed personalities like Frigid Farrah , which gives the impression of shyness and Wild Wendy with an " adventurous " personality .	-4.9341
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well suited to your personality as possible , " says True Companion .	-4.3626
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc .	-3.1674
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people !	-3.5424
It can be tired , fixated on conversation , or it can be ' in mood ' !	-3.2431
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics , the allusions to rape , when one moves to Frigid ( i.e. , reluctant ) Farrah , worry one of the most .	-5.9486
On his website , True Companion compared Roxxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.6941
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxy ? " says the website .	-3.7809
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-3.2810
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality , to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-3.7140
Most men will not hold sex robots , of course , and while FRR notes its growing popularity , they remain temporarily on the verge of consumer culture .	-4.9564
But what leaks from the peripheral areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.7924
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-2.3580
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who lied about having sexually assaulted women .	-5.7056
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Magd 's Report ' ) is not the graphic images , the twisted bodies and the eyes cast , but how realistic this vision looks .	-5.3549
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-2.6396
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with porn proportions ) .	-4.3187
Their builders want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-2.3857
But , to put it bluntly , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , the robots are not real women .	-3.3138
You cannot separate from your pet or just leave .	-4.3556
They have no mediation or background , nothing to indicate independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjugation .	-4.8070
In other words , they are beguiling slaves .	-2.1929
Or , to put it in the 2017 saying , Tuesmaids	-4.4088
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-0.7290
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense .	-2.3809
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families .	-3.2549
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival , the US had newspapers advising on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s electing relatives .	-5.3155
We are all supposed to be working hard to let our filter bubbles burst .	-5.5461
Less noted has been Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.2317
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.4965
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.8075
With Trump in the White House , anyone she knows , including the Republican kinship with which she fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and strangely on the same side .	-4.4172
This is certainly a good thing about the table , but it strikes me in a broader context that this also entails considerable risks .	-5.7168
Trump has strengthened the left , but the distorting effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right .	-3.3702
When we talk about " normalization " and Trump , we refer to the gruesome possibility that his minions will one day no longer repel us .	-4.9878
But there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump " normalizes " right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality when compared to his standards .	-5.4316
Today , I find myself struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s bizarre version of the madman – the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like ) – both of which , in fact , seem to be a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-6.2718
If Trump goes , the next Republican candidate will need only be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.7253
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of New York ’ s carousels , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don ’ t need a coffee .	-4.7157
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knitted and the animals twisted to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the clipping music conveys this in a strange way .	-6.7534
So many clichés disappoint a city : the views of high buildings get old , the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-7.9151
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite over the day , when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed pub does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London .	-4.6061
The Central Park carousel , however , is still a strangely magical experience , as two two years old , an 11-year-old and two women can go on in the 40 's and all have a great time .	-6.7854
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .	-3.5242
On the other hand , in a department store this week , I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-4.0088
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to compare the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .	-4.7144
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .	-3.9920
The poor woman in the department store was excruciating while I was tired of the experience of extending my five-star credit card to her .	-6.1076
Oscar Pistorius with Breast Pains from Prison to Hospital	-3.5918
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.5503
Last year , he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists , which , according to the prison authorities , he suffered in his cell after a case .	-4.2185
Pistorius was sentenced for murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first sentence of death .	-4.0989
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine ’ s Day in 2013 by shooting her on her several times through a door in his house in Pretoria .	-4.6093
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the cabin .	-3.7342
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-3.1156
The National Prosecution Service said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.8415
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed .	-3.8434
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.6638
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg	-2.1135
As the last of the Blumberger schools , the four-plaintiffs from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed into holidays and secondary schools .	-4.8610
Three of the discharge students will go to high school and four to secondary school .	-5.1967
School leader Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental House in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-4.7580
As a symbol of school leaving school , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken yard but is then released into freedom .	-4.9968
This was followed by a musical called " Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf " .	-5.8063
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it be bribed by his hens .	-3.5222
Instead of a chicken kitchen a small eagle came out .	-3.2136
But the hope of making him a chicken crumbled , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and dropped out .	-5.8278
Then the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the composition of Yvonne Frank .	-4.0490
The hens danced with the young gockles who wore cylinders to bet .	-2.6959
The eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-2.9565
Although the kitten is different from the other kittens ( chicks ) , it is one of them .	-4.5452
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.8013
Its purpose is to be free .	-1.9214
She wanted every four-plaintiff to feel accepted in his new school .	-4.3895
Thanks were also given to our colleagues , the former head of the school , Michael Müller , who is constantly stepping in at school bottlenecks , and the parents ' representatives .	-8.9752
The chickenage is now over , says class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.4136
They are very reluctant to release their students after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .	-4.8006
Finally , they were able to rely on the four-plaintiffs .	-4.5944
At the end , all students had a song of summer time and holiday time .	-5.1683
The children were very happy .	-4.9320
Eight first class pupils have already been registered for the new school year .	-3.5218
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.4938
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .	-3.0603
On the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of illegally staying people in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.5891
On the same day , they were released while an investigation is currently under way .	-6.4681
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released .	-2.5577
The Greek authorities have strengthened control over the free camp and are imposing substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for that purpose .	-5.2686
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.5986
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-1.9786
Software Update for diesel vehicles : What those affected need to know now	-3.2941
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-2.0770
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the event ?	-3.1070
The most important questions and answers in general .	-2.7888
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.6597
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and Euro 6 in part .	-4.9383
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-2.2166
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :	-2.5599
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.2953
No , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .	-1.7097
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have Schummel software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.3581
Its retrofit was ordered by the German Federal Office for the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt ( KBA ) .	-5.8491
How and when are customers informed about updates ?	-2.3181
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet set a precise date .	-4.4323
Daimler has announced that it will write to everyone concerned .	-5.0520
If an inspection is required in any case , it will be done within the framework of that inspection .	-4.4355
How long should the overall changeover take ?	-3.1061
" Hard to say , " says Smetanin .	-2.4639
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure .	-3.1038
'We have seen that car manufacturers have not yet acted voluntarily on the subject of the environment . '	-4.4056
How long should the update take ?	-1.7203
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.2709
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment .	-2.9298
What are drivers who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.8703
The ACE advises to wait .	-2.2665
According to Smetanin , foreign producers would probably follow suit .	-3.3082
Is there now a massive fall in the price of Euro-4 cars ?	-3.2262
ACE fears that .	-1.6802
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are at risk .	-4.0071
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.7596
The ACE advises to wait for a sale .	-2.5655
LL Cool J	-1.9611
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.2177
President Trump ’ s first award ceremony promises to be political .	-2.7416
One of the winners does not want to come - in protest .	-2.4473
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .	-1.9614
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year , singers Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) , choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the guests .	-4.7655
The awards will be given at the beginning of December .	-7.5894
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Melania .	-3.2570
As a result , Lear , a winner of progressive TV series , has already announced that he will not participate in the gala .	-6.2024
He said to the New York Times : ' This Presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that is a burden on me ' .	-5.5503
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view .	-2.8950
The Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.3109
Former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.4665
Making the City Living	-2.4813
Roland Wacker , Haslan ’ s city architect , retires next year .	-2.8087
The job is already advertised - however , suitable candidates are rare .	-3.8312
Wacker has been a city architect for 31 years .	-2.5666
And he still enjoys the work he does in the press .	-4.3610
He reports on varied but demanding tasks waiting for his successor .	-4.1885
At the same time , he is surprised that no application has met the requirements .	-4.4615
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the earliest possible time .	-3.5734
In this way , with due regard for the regular periods of notice , there should still be enough time for preparation .	-7.2343
Since Haslach functions as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community , the Applicant must present the relevant qualifications .	-6.4135
The city wants to retain this function in any case . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-7.9817
If they were no longer able to fill them out , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-4.3638
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself , says Wacker , who reports about a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens .	-5.5842
In more than 30 years in office , Wacker has accumulated some important projects with pride .	-4.8825
" We make the city liveable " , he is safe through the construction office and his employees .	-5.2742
But varied projects will continue to be on the agenda in the future too : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the parking lot in Niederhof , for example , has begun .	-6.3274
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , and the reconstruction of the stadium is still under discussion .	-4.6781
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million , ' if we get it right ' , Wacker estimates .	-4.1269
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.0533
The work here is fun . '	-1.8033
There is a lot of room for a city architect .	-5.1356
With Haslan ’ s own building yard and gardening , a lot of flexibility can be achieved .	-6.3104
" You can move a lot " , Wacker said , and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-4.9378
As the old town is protected as an ensemble , it is important to " have an eye on what fits in " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city architect emphasizes .	-6.6139
In any case , the city architect bears a great responsibility .	-4.1956
He is a builder , " at the end everything goes over my table " .	-4.3478
He can count on many years of staff in support and coordination : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( Tiefbau ) for 15 years .	-5.9774
Wacker also wants his successor to stay a long time : " We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified with the place and want to stay " .	-5.9712
Continuity is important not only for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city .	-3.7989
According to information from the city of Haslach , anyone wishing to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to have completed a degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a technical field of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of planning and planning law .	-8.5617
The Municipal Building Authority is responsible for building and civil engineering , building management , land acquisition , municipal property management , municipal farm with building yard and municipal gardening as well as Lower Building Law Authority including monument protection .	-11.1477
Bikes thrown on lines : South railway closed	-7.0129
According to the police , the previously unknown culprits had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the area of Leobener Strasse ( B116 ) on the lines .	-5.0906
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-3.6622
The investigators leave two male offenders and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-4.1060
Witnesses observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver near the .	-5.2359
" This goes far beyond a stroke of eavesdropping , " said ÖBB-speaker Christoph Posch to APA .	-6.0142
The perpetrator or perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and also put rail transport at risk .	-4.0110
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement transport , the perpetrators could also be charged to the customers of the railway .	-8.1963
All in all , a " significant " sum should be assumed , said the speaker .	-5.4694
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon , and rail traffic on the southern railway line could be handled without any obstacles .	-7.7350
Almost ten passenger trains were out on Friday morning , two of which concerned long-distance transport .	-4.7945
Freight trains did not stop , but they were delayed .	-2.8515
According to the ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch , about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .	-4.1247
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.2850
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help alleviate IBD ( inflammatory bowel disease ) .	-2.7714
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.3780
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases .	-3.5576
The ominous state , which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK , causes stomach cramps and blowers , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme tiredness .	-5.4221
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-8.5330
The chief researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body .	-4.0002
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .	-3.1288
If the balance goes too far in the direction of inflammation , inflammatory bowel disease can result . are . are . are . are , , , , , , , , ,	-7.7994
Experiments found that some kind of tolerant immunodeficiency occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their enclosures .	-4.9797
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to cause the appearance of the cells .	-3.3399
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a bacterial drug - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom , and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance .	-4.9800
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . "	-2.9531
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote a more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal milieus if the same system works in humans .	-4.4978
The postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Baragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study girls had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was housed separately , did not .	-5.9023
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice ’ s colorectal microorganisms – the community of bacteria , viruses , and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.2123
The mice ’ s dams were DNA sequenced and six bacteria arteries found in mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in mice .	-6.1402
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lacked a intestinal microbio and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were created with L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-6.5368
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , L. reuteri researchers grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice .	-4.5823
Immune cells developed into tolerant cells .	-2.7359
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid .	-3.1547
If researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice ’ s feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but if the tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.2785
Dr. Cervantes-Baragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract .	-2.9943
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease .	-4.3928
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine .	-3.4109
Potentially , high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . '	-3.7675
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed Nemanja Matic to a ' genius ' .	-2.1425
Manchester United has signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampadoria on Wednesday evening .	-4.6100
Chelsea ’ s £ 40 million signature began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched to their liking .	-6.1052
Matic , however , had been excluded from the blues ’ preparatory Asia tour and made only 45 minutes , leaving Mourinho to admit that he had to improve before the premier league season began .	-6.3323
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.8773
'We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later ' .	-2.1950
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season .	-4.5239
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments .	-3.5567
" Three out of four , I thank the club , " he added .	-3.0071
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made a great effort ' .	-3.5450
Boeing ' paints ' Dreamliner to Heaven	-7.3422
The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-2.5009
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and took the form of a Dreamliner over the US , which is several thousand kilometers .	-6.3812
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.5232
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner .	-3.1205
It was a endurance test for new engines .	-2.8500
Boeing had already made such advertising before .	-2.2415
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing-logo were painted in the sky .	-3.5588
A new blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem .	-2.9248
How the wind turns : when Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD , Social Democratic prime ministers looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections .	-5.0264
If there were no troublemakers from the party ’ s headquarters , but no headwinds from the federal government – that was the main wish of the election fighters .	-8.3985
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed radically .	-2.5233
Since then , the Willy-Brandt-Haus staff have watched with increasing horror the events in the SPD-governed state capitals .	-5.4979
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds .	-3.3579
They were setbacks .	-2.3827
One by one .	-2.0856
The Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-3.3913
" This shows once again : Red Green simply cannot govern reliably , " said Christian Democratic Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-4.9493
The surprising outburst of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-3.7480
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-2.9382
Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Tvest to return their mandate .	-5.7017
The transition to the CDU clearly distorts the will of the electorate .	-3.5604
Elke Tvest must immediately return its mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and campaign manager of the Greens to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-5.3254
" All this must not be true , " a SPD campaigner sighs when the new message of Hios reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-6.6538
Stephan Weil , the Prime Minister of the Social Democratic Party of Lower Saxony , has been elected to the CDU without a majority of his own after the Green MEP Elke Tvest joined .	-6.9495
It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .	-4.2500
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.9550
The misery began with the unexpectedly significant defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-3.5887
A blue eye , no more , the comrades then calmed .	-4.1732
After the provincial elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different .	-2.2298
That became the case - and everything became much worse .	-4.6200
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a tailspin , and the Dusseldorf Pleite flattened the party .	-5.9959
The comrades grumbled up again in the weeks after that .	-5.0327
Then , when they had just acquired new courage , the G20 summit in Hamburg came .	-4.0680
And with him came the next blow .	-1.6881
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus this weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-4.0665
And because , in crisis communication , he then made pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong .	-5.2650
Since then , Scholz has struggled for its political survival .	-5.2708
Now also Stephan Weil .	-1.7563
Due to the VW exhaust affair and its role in the supervisory board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in the criticism for some time .	-5.9621
Mixed poll numbers were added .	-3.8812
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , in the last few weeks , Weil has been trying more and more to set the tone in the federal government .	-7.5622
The aim of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden from comrades around Martin Schulz .	-5.1584
They granted him because they promised to stabilize the party from Weil .	-4.1170
Now the opposite could happen .	-3.0111
Because , in fact , the Dutch Greens are not to blame for the party-internal dispute .	-5.7655
And Schulz certainly not .	-1.7386
In the meantime , the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.7896
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and in particular at the breakaway parliamentarian of Tvest .	-5.3861
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Mrs Tvest puts her own career interests above the interests of all others , " says Matthias Miersch , leader of the party left in the SPD Bundestag group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-6.1583
Mrs Tvest was elected to Parliament not because she was a direct candidate , but because of the country list of the Dutch Greens , according to the Lower Saxony MEP .	-5.8404
The logical consequence would be to return its mandate .	-2.6201
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestag , laments an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-4.2754
" The will of the electorate four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the German Social Democratic Party as the top candidate in the German Bundestag , the RND .	-5.8134
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result , " Oppermann continued .	-3.7912
He asked to clarify the background .	-2.7367
I would like to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU Niedersachsen .	-4.1872
Aid for centre III	-3.0046
If you want to renovate your old house , you can get help from the country soon .	-5.2872
On Wednesday , Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG city development took notice of this .	-5.1355
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler again gave a retrospective of what has happened so far .	-4.3630
Since 1991 , there have been areas of recovery in sensitive areas .	-5.3059
At that time , in the Sanierungsgebiet I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg took over two-thirds of the funding amount .	-4.8724
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-3.0231
For Schindler , the previous renovations are a " success " - after all , it is important to promote internal development as well , and not only to develop new building areas .	-6.3521
On 4 April , the Karlsruhe Government Bureau informed us that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-5.9077
The amount of funding would be EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the municipality felt .	-5.2681
How does a rehabilitation area develop ?	-4.4738
According to Schindler , we will investigate where the ' really old ' houses are .	-4.1147
It also has a role to play , however , as to whether there is any interest whatsoever in the planned area .	-5.6715
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be changed again .	-4.6175
The STEC represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-1.8825
Keller presented the contents of the federal state program " Social City " , in which the renovations would be carried out .	-5.0300
At the heart of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure .	-4.6394
The measures would be carried out on an objective basis , that is to say per piece of land .	-4.9496
The recovery area would then be defined as a statute .	-4.7317
Since 1 January 2017 , the grant period has continued until 30 April 2026 .	-3.8080
By September of this year , however , the inventory would first be carried out , in which those involved in the recovery area would receive a questionnaire to complete it .	-7.0774
In November or December , if possible , the decision on the constitution should be taken so that the renovations can begin next year .	-6.5895
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .	-4.4313
It is a question of assessing urban problems and deciding when and to what extent .	-4.7992
It will then also be entered in the Land Registry for the respective property .	-7.5656
Pietzschmann will come up again and get an idea of the situation , she promised .	-5.2259
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .	-4.1957
That is why there will be questionnaires , which will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and which can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-5.0868
The yellow questionnaire is the " Building and Land Arch " , which deals , among other things , with the building condition and the intention to redevelop .	-6.4524
In the grey questionnaire , the " Household and Housing Arch " , information on the size , distribution and residents of a living room can be provided .	-6.2889
The blue " operating sheet " is only to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building .	-5.1030
However , it should be noted , as Gotzel pointed out , that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding .	-4.1243
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible for support .	-3.6753
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds works according to the " greyhound principle " - who comes first , first steals .	-5.7476
You cannot " reserve " funds for later .	-3.8724
Finally , photos of the project " village centre II " were shown in order to make a " tasty " renovation for those present .	-7.6368
British inventors use a microchip to move home and car by hand .	-4.1618
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office , and even start his car with a hand movement .	-4.2936
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq .	-3.7945
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson , an anesthetist in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant process is performed in accordance with medical standards .	-4.2873
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-2.3714
Mr. Northam 's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra £ 300 per lock .	-4.8865
The married father of one has now installed both his home and his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .	-4.9117
The White House ’ s Advertising Costs Cost Taxpayers Thousands	-2.9721
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlighted American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military , which was handed over to TIME magazine .	-4.5032
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was at the heart of the White House event on July 17 with American construction programs .	-4.2462
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-3.1067
The helicopter , manufactured in Connecticut , was exhibited next to a Maine yacht , a Wisconsin fire brigade and a Mississippi forklift truck .	-4.3312
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-4.4024
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his boss , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-4.4156
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July at 3 p.m. and stayed until the pitch was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.9425
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of working hours .	-5.4451
The original crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .	-4.8998
The TIME records did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .	-3.8202
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-1.8784
rows indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could break the determination .	-3.7764
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-3.5771
" Sounds as if you are closed , " the deputy commander replied .	-3.2968
The ' Made in America ' event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.9088
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.2187
At the event , the president gave a push for reform of the health reform underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to contain government regulations .	-6.2589
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.6312
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.1972
But asking for their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .	-3.7071
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential plane served taxi services against the backdrop of his first Kampagnenrallye in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of complaints about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential plane .	-4.4082
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made In America " - which shows products from all 50 countries manufactured by American workers using American materials , " said White House Deputy Secretary of the Press , Lindsay Walters .	-3.8801
HMX 1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to clear US President in the White House .	-6.4559
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July , HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House .	-2.9651
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-3.3153
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for " Non-Presidential Support Missions " .	-3.6139
The White House said that taxpayers did not take over the burden of any of the other props presented at the event .	-3.9179
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-3.8277
HMX-1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.7593
However , according to hourly rates of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the VH-3D DoD refund rate is $ 24.380 per flight hour .	-4.5672
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-2.8277
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate .	-2.9276
'Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading , ' said Walters .	-5.1682
'These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds ' .	-3.2477
According to a 2015 RAND study , the compensation rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .	-4.0808
At that time , Sean Spicer , the former White House Press Secretary , defended the helicopter ’ s use for the event .	-4.2254
" The idea is to present things made in America this week , " Spicer said .	-2.7742
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , of people depend on it .	-3.5772
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.1007
It is , of course , appropriate to stress this . '	-2.8968
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his South Lawn tour for the event , but he was in the driver ’ s seat of a firearm car .	-4.8937
In the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky ’ s representatives , joking with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-3.2107
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said , ' I have three of them . '	-2.2728
TC BW Neuss	-2.6210
Spitzeiter der zweiten Tennis Bundesliga tritt beim Table Third Suchsdorfer SV .	-5.7433
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third table search village SV .	-5.6267
Despite five matches , the top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has gained a sense of reality .	-7.4063
Team leader Marius Zay certainly has respect for his opponent .	-3.5256
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formations .	-2.9801
I find the team very good on the back . '	-4.5438
Imports from the High North are the main reasons for class and stability in the search village SV .	-6.3172
" Their Danes and Finns can even point to stakes in the Davis Cup .	-3.4599
And they are also strong in double , " says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-3.1620
" As always , this will be difficult for us .	-2.3011
You also need a good portion of luck . '	-3.4222
The Neuss team for the trip to the high north is practical .	-3.2671
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier .	-2.7848
If the Frenchman who is still active in the challenge tournament in Biella , Italy , does not succeed in the Bundesliga match , the Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Republic will be his first bet this season .	-7.6096
The hitherto unwon Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel .	-4.4018
He should be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp , Niels Lootsma ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina .	-5.7444
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster , Máté Valkusz could also join the team again .	-4.5812
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary , which was still the number one junior world ranking in January 2016 , someone from the trainer club around Marius Zay will fill up the cadre .	-6.1764
How America Can Damage OMV	-1.8829
Indeed , Donald Trump was not happy when he signed on Wednesday evening the law tightening sanctions against Russia .	-4.4178
" In its haste to enact the law , " the Congress packaged a few " unconstitutional regulations , " he estimated .	-4.9250
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US push .	-4.3284
After all , the proposal envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-4.0887
Since then , investors of the domestic OMV , who , together with other European companies , co-finance the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 , have been similarly worried .	-7.0118
The threat backdrop is enormous .	-2.6276
Yet it is too early to assess the consequences , according to the oil company ’ s official statement .	-3.4153
In fact , Donald Trump himself would have to revive sanctions by executive order .	-4.7694
Twelve weapons are at his disposal .	-2.7787
" The press " has looked at which the company could defend itself and which could really hurt it .	-4.6517
Narco 's Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be placed in the spotlight in the Netflix hit series .	-4.5777
Despite the second season of Narcos , which reveals Pablo Escobar 's killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-2.8787
The season three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show .	-3.9622
With the third season , DEA has focused its attention on the richest drug trade organization in the world : the Cali cartel .	-4.2626
Led by four powerful sponsors , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more state bribes and violent actions .	-3.2407
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican compound , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-1.9153
In the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña , the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs .	-3.4110
Other new actors are Matias Varela , Michael Steel-David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .	-1.9180
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1 .	-1.8914
Rolling backwards : the city employs 46 kitchen utensils .	-4.2870
The city organizes the Kita lunch for itself .	-4.3269
With strong contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .	-4.1666
The clock is turned back in the urban nurseries .	-3.8481
On 1 September , the city of Krefeld will again take over the food supply in the urban nursery facilities ( Kitas ) .	-6.0871
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Director of Youth Aid , this is good news : ' We were all very pleased ' .	-3.4977
Cooking is still done outside the house : a caterer takes on this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled . .	-11.2458
The city operates 46 day-care facilities in the Krefeld area , and 44 children get a warm meal at midday .	-8.8668
In the past kite life , 2800 children each sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .	-7.2257
" Not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week are now eating in the Kita for lunch " , explains Pommeranz .	-5.9451
'The offer also applies to 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m. ' .	-4.1111
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the food delivered , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , carry out the meal individually , leave the food , rinse and clean the kitchen .	-6.8039
" The employees are firmly assigned to a kita " , says Pommeranz .	-3.9220
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the number of hours .	-4.5083
" The kitchen workers are now firmly part of the Kita team " , says Pommeranz satisfied .	-4.6512
" Thus , they are much more closely involved and it is easier for Kitaleitung to implement pedagogical concepts " .	-5.4541
That is also what it is about : healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-4.1576
" The children should help prepare the food " .	-2.5964
The direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team makes sense .	-3.3722
For children too .	-2.1556
" They have a known force in the kita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people " .	-7.1493
This continuity is important for children .	-1.2460
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel .	-6.2610
This variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only improved the quality of the kitchen service , but also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in comparison with the costs of self-government and foreign allocation for the city , according to the press office .	-8.8892
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited .	-2.9614
" But these hours do not matter so much to some 750 people in the education sector , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-4.9581
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN .	-1.6874
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .	-1.9792
Nicholas Haysom , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will stand in Council elections in the provinces , with three women running for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters being women .	-4.7296
" The role of women cannot be overestimated , " he said on Wednesday in a statement .	-1.8869
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.3619
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.2029
The Taliban have issued threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .	-2.9832
This year , for the first time , the elections will peacefully transfer power from one democratically elected government to another .	-2.2945
Haysom said that a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan 's democratic success .	-2.2495
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total of 3.6 million registered voters are registered .	-2.3618
Jubilee on TV	-3.1132
On the occasion of its 110-year existence , TV Kaiseringen invites you for a small walk with coffee and cake .	-5.1948
The hike starts on Sunday , July 9th at 1 p.m. in Frohnstetten near the water reservoir in the American Highway .	-4.4598
From there it goes to the airfield , to Natter and via the Waldhof back to the water reservoir .	-4.2581
The walk takes about one and a half hours .	-2.4716
After that , there are coffee , cakes , cool drinks , chestnuts and cheeses in Kaiseringen .	-5.3183
If you need a car ride from Kaiseringen to Frohnstetten , the meeting point is in Kaiseringen at school .	-5.3525
Men are trying to rob 13-year-old girls	-2.9344
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday .	-3.0618
According to information from the police , the men spoke to the 13-year-old , who was on Kolpingstraße with friends , about 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to phone the girl 's mobile . .	-10.2543
The 13-year-old refused the request and continued with her friends .	-3.4408
In response , one of the perpetrators tried to attack the girl 's mobile phone and necklace , which however failed .	-7.0381
The duo escaped without prey .	-2.6623
The two young men were later arrested by the police .	-1.9016
The investigations are under way .	-1.5598
GMB concern about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.1285
A trade union would like to check with managers of McVitie Biskuit manufacturer on the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant .	-5.6540
GMB Scotland said that the company had remained silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site .	-3.2724
More than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces , among other products , Hobbons and Rich Tea Kekse .	-4.3193
McVitie 's owner , Pladis , said that he has invested more than £ 5 million in recent years .	-3.8738
He added that if their activities changed , employees and trade union representatives would be " the first to experience " .	-3.7704
In a letter to the company 's subsidiary director , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called for " concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward " .	-5.3678
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply concerns our members .	-4.8936
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force is concentrating heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-5.1470
Therefore , with a view to jobs , wages , and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , rising living costs , and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie . "	-5.2709
One speaker from Pladis said : " The director of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-6.3391
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with Tollcross staff and GMB representatives , where some questions were discussed openly .	-3.5406
We discussed with our employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-5.9980
She added : " In recent years we have invested more than £ 5 million in our Tollcross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-2.9498
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site , and if our operations change at the site , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know . '	-5.4662
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago against Neymar ?	-2.5899
The La League ’ s side may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-2.6391
Paris Saint-Germain will continue to persecute Neymar after offering £ 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record accident ?	-4.7828
The sensational approach fueled the transfer window in the summer , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than twice the previous record , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for £ 89 million .	-4.8408
After finishing , Neymar becomes the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest paid professional athlete .	-4.9229
Barcelona is furious about the way in which Neymar forced his way out , even though a source close to the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to deal with him since he arrived from Santos in 2013 .	-5.4681
But was the PSG president warning the world of this prospect three years ago ?	-2.8900
When Manchester City declared interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser al-Khelaifi had a strong warning to any club that wanted to have one of the best players from PSG signed .	-3.9996
" I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.8891
" We respect all clubs .	-0.8460
But if they try to get one of our players signed with them , they will have consequences . '	-3.9634
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer .	-3.1149
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar .	-4.6859
Rollers Turned and Damaged	-3.1071
During the night from Friday to Saturday , an unknown perpetrator deliberately dropped a scooter on Königsfelder Straße in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused material damage of over 200 euros on the fairing of the vehicle .	-6.6986
Police Schramberg , phone 07422 / 27 01-0 , asks for information .	-3.3009
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese .	-3.1511
Because a car met him on his track , the driver of a VW Touran had to escape and touched the circuit .	-7.6161
On Thursday evening , the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on the road with his VW at around 19.55 on the B 215 from Stolzenau to Le.	-5.1447
In the area around Stolzenau , a passenger car arrived in his lane , so he had to move to the right .	-6.0161
In doing so , the Touran driver touched the mainframe .	-6.1443
Property damage was caused on the car .	-4.9464
The driver of the next passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident .	-4.7572
According to the accident victim , it may be a good thing that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident .	-6.0489
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter pays vehicle to contact the commissioners in Stolzenau by telephone 05761 / 92060 .	-5.4251
Interview : ' Domspatzen report relieves Papt-Brother Georg Ratzinger '	-3.3593
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves Papst-Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-4.4090
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-2.3242
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen continues to generate debate .	-5.0123
Christian Weisner , spokesman of the reform movement " Wir sind Kirche " , declared after publication to the German Press Agency that he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and now Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the master master of the cathedral , Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emeritud Pope Benedict XVI .	-11.4083
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or at the time their misjudgment of what was happening .	-8.1063
On the other hand , the Vatican Department " Osservatore Romano " criticized the use of " double standards " in the reporting of violence in the Cathedral Spatz .	-7.2218
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that they are ' shameful and shameful acts ' that should be punished and prevented in the future ; but what is striking is the ' degree of media manipulation ' , according to the author Lucetta Scarafia , historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee .	-5.2963
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " writes Scarafia .	-4.1639
In the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk , Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said : " You like going to the church and this is a pleasure to eat " .	-6.1603
She also pointed out that in her youth , " beatings were a quite normal pedagogical tool " to cope with naughty children , as I was one of them " .	-6.4119
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.4481
In connection with the reports of the cases of abuse , the papal brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared .	-5.8201
Unjustly , says author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the book " My brother the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-4.7649
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " Hesemann says , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he assesses the results of the final report .	-3.6311
What exactly does the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , who was appointed to the Enlightenment by the Bistum Regensburg ?	-4.9474
A total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 domain fun .	-6.0353
In the final report , Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , said : " To sum up , in many cases , Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence .	-4.9407
Especially with high emotionality the punishment could be more severe for the students .	-5.2669
However , unlike many other defendants , it is striking that many victims appreciated R. 's general humanity and thus , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence " .	-6.7398
In the interview Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen under Georg Ratzinger is relieving the burden .	-6.6402
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the ' incidents of the use of force on protected persons in Regensburg 's Cathedral Spatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Cathedral Master Georg Ratzinger .	-6.0135
On the one hand , many students emphasize their " humanity " .	-3.2499
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist , who often became handy when a cathedral pitch did not bring top performance musically .	-7.7434
As a biographer , how do you view this final report ?	-2.8016
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble to read the whole 440-page report from front to rear , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it .	-5.0793
Only eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-3.9471
The excessive violence at pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of influence .	-3.8082
At best , he can be accused of learning about this too late or of not having taken the initial indications seriously enough .	-6.0199
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by practically all respondents as " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-5.0526
Thus , the vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , give an excellent testimony , describing him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as an extremely benevolent teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , cookies and sweets and was " always surrounded by children 's grapes " .	-7.7313
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which sometimes led to a breakdown .	-5.6180
He himself admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he not only cracked with chairs and threw the keyring onto the floor , but also drew ear slaps and too naughty boys on his hair or ears .	-7.8618
In order to save his honor , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , among both parents and teachers .	-5.6726
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-2.8888
Of course , I think each of us born before 1968 .	-2.3360
I , too , experienced this in a secular school , a state high school .	-3.8487
Compared to what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and excessive pre-school violence , these are , of course , minor .	-5.4683
One wonders if it is not more to do with his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him .	-6.4698
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope .	-3.4166
But the truth is : the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-3.9186
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the issue of misuse of Regensburg 's Cathedral Spatzen .	-5.9808
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report ?	-3.3298
Michael Hesemann : Clearly no .	-2.3188
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted himself to the master of the cathedral .	-3.4017
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.6820
" I never dared to talk to my father or mother about this , " one of the people affected said , " It was all very embarrassing to me . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-11.2565
The real problem in educating people about sexual abuse was , and still is , that most victims remain silent out of shame .	-4.0802
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings , it would certainly not be a choir leader , who would , in a sense , have been a colleague of the perpetrator .	-6.0452
How do the Domspatzen Sturgeon Ratzinger 's role in the cases of abuse assess ?	-5.2642
Michael Hesemann : As one of the students surveyed put it , " Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator .	-6.7782
I also think it is really absurd to assume that it is him of all things ... Bubs have become more intrusive , clearer or even more open than to their parents , heads of boarding schools , teachers of trust , etc .	-8.8967
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.9867
Thus , the report comes to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed during the investigation ' .	-7.0462
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any complicity .	-4.2654
In this way , he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or of having made a complaint .	-5.9531
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these heinous crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.5807
There was much in the media about " excessive violence " at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen .	-4.8089
The former master of the cathedral , Georg Ratzinger , is accused in the report " Wegschauen " .	-5.4557
Does he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.5703
Michael Hesemann : That is the big problem , that everything has been mixed up and mixed up in the reporting , into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excessive violence and somewhere in the middle , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.4927
That , however , is another abuse of the report .	-3.2680
There is a clean distinction between pre-school and high school of the cathedral 's spas , between sexual abuse and excessive violence and , let us say , other accusations .	-7.6928
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , that is to say four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir leader of the Cathedral Spatzen .	-5.7658
All the terrible caning pedagogy , the cases in which boys were properly harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers , and among which were horrified , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed .	-7.5556
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he only saw the boys when they were already on Domspatzengymnasium .	-4.9689
On that , as most witnesses emphasize , was the subject of " pre-school " taboo .	-4.0743
One was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-5.2653
What was different at Domspatzengymnasium ?	-3.2216
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-2.7568
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims appreciated R. 's general humanity and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence ' .	-4.9260
At most , there remains the charge of having looked away .	-4.6567
Despite all the efforts , however , the report could only define two periods in which it was told about pre-school conditions .	-4.3250
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he was just starting to establish himself and was unwilling to hear anything about the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( according to the witness ) , and then again around 1993 .	-7.7823
Is Georg Ratzinger consistently closing his ears before the states ?	-4.1386
Michael Hesemann : No , because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.6901
In it he points out to them that ' caning continues to be practised in pre-school ' .	-5.2605
Even in the face of the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .	-3.5662
This was , of course , at a time when there was legal clarity , when caning was banned in Bavaria long ago .	-7.7569
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as I think we all know .	-3.9565
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit was actually exceeded .	-6.3990
Nor can we say that he has always looked away .	-3.6208
That is simply not true .	-1.2757
It was not until 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-2.8881
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to that time .	-4.2776
How do you see that ?	-1.9669
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " pitfall of anachronism " , in other words the danger of assessing the past according to today 's moral standards .	-5.3337
The princess is right .	-2.4512
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which has been odious at all times , nor to the acts of resistance and violence committed against innocent children ’ s souls in pre-school , which goes far beyond what was then common practice .	-7.6081
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being tackled .	-4.7335
But at the same time I have to protect Mr Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.7056
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to say , pulling his ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-5.3309
When physical punishment was then banned , he also adhered strictly to it .	-3.9393
What image of his time in Regensburg has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in talks with you for the book " My brother the Pope " ?	-5.1020
Did the subject of caning also come up ?	-3.1740
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , that he played only a side role .	-5.9904
Nevertheless , I do not deny that he had a strict regime there .	-4.0489
But that , too , has to be said : without this perfectionism , without the demands of absolute discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to transform the hitherto more nationally known Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen into an institution of world renown , true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-7.1951
With biscuits and bonbons alone , you don ’ t make unruly boys big singers and face every success , no matter which area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-8.0712
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book ?	-4.3543
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him again and again as wonderful , humorous , grubby , deeply believable and heart-good people , of whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything for a fly .	-8.3529
I regularly get to know how many former Dome Spatzen still today , 23 years after his invention , keep in regular contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .	-6.9632
Those who still do not forgive him for being strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-4.1629
Most of the Cathedral Spatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to their attention .	-5.2331
And that he was always a good , father teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a kind and respectful respect , to which they still look today and which they almost revere .	-9.5480
And let me make it quite clear once again that all that is being accused of is teaching methods that were the order of the day .	-9.0246
We can be pleased that we have long since overcome this time .	-3.7282
But it is highly unfair to turn a man into a media scapegoat simply because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother .	-3.7720
The evil intention behind this is all too obvious .	-2.7616
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.5647
Now the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit , and who would probably not know the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , should finally be at peace .	-8.3874
