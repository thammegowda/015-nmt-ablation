Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city.
A misleading institution where young people should meet today.
A crypt chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug.
Small gardeners manage the former farmer ’ s land. are..
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories.
It annoys if maps are not up to date.
Everyone knows that, because the auto navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas, an offer of the Bavarian Geoportal to the state government, are far from current - but this is precisely why they are very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the area of distribution of Merkur in Munich have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be recognized as such.
For cities and municipalities, more detailed maps, so-called primitive maps, have been incorporated into the large overview map.
According to data from the Bavarian survey management, these were established between 1810 and 1864 and originated from Bavaria ’ s first survey.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria from the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical reception of Bavaria, of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops eventually departed with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was the current neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the "Topographische Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian survey management.
The Munich Urpositionsblatt (Urpositionsblatt) dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between the former and the present is the most impressive of the provincial capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich-based district 21 years after the map was drawn up in 1877.
Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered corridors from the so-called "original photo" from which the property tax was derived.
Today, small plots no longer cover farmers, but small gardeners of the land in the sun.
A large green area is visible north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the venue of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the hill "Auf der Lüften", but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, people with delusions were once locked up here on Auerfeldstraße.
The Munich-Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded there in 1858 / 59.
From 1872 onwards, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the anchoring of the so-called astray.
He has also banned the personnel from using force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working with the institution for an exhibition.
There was room for 280 patients at first, and then there were 500.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district irrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatry, has been located there since 2006.
On the premises of the former Auer Anstalt youths now meet at the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training enterprises.
To the west is the football pitch of the TSV München Ost, east residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the "Casa Don Bosco" children's house was built, based on the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed by bombing during World War II.
Marienplatz was named "Haupt Platz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allied bombs broke many holes into the city centre.
A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business buildings and a medieval crypt once stood at the Marienhof, where the preparatory work will take place these days, and the spade stitch for the second S-Bahn strain route will take place on 5 April 2017.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial photo of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof., and.!!!!!
Citizens' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention and exercise extreme caution when travelling through the state, because a number of dubious race-based incidents have recently been reported throughout the state," stated in the Group's opinion.
A recent Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to take action against discrimination, and the state ’ s law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warnings, said the NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten up or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard. '
It is the first such warning issued by the US State Organisation.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline left while travelling through the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri, which shows that black drivers are 75% more likely than white drivers in the state.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
'People must be prepared whether they bring bailouts or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state. '
In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime report, ranking the state as the country ’ s 16th country in terms of the number of such violations.
Travel warnings are also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration, which ACLU believes will contribute to further race profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezau Project is Elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezau project is a successful project and will be continued next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on the ground.
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Schwendemann family ’ s rectangular courtyard.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals, and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest milk" is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
The guests' table is exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the pasture fence project "elementary important".
I cannot make a profit on such steep land.
A lot of work needs to be done with the motor sense.
"We are struggling with the conditions and topography here," said Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not run a bio-farm.
For mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The local authority recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the Leader promotion".
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3 000 and 4 000 per hectare.
It is hoped that this will allow the reforestation of the land to continue for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their business," said the mayor.
Farmers are often criticized for promoting it.
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced in through the support of willow fences.
The area covered is thus 40 hectares, which must not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of EUR 71 500, half were subsidised by Leader, and a quarter were carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This leaves farmers EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fences.
"The great advantage is the longevity of fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible".
Peter Weiß also stated: "Best food is produced here".
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state funding of fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a funding framework designated by the LPR.
Moreover, the area to be fenced must not be tradable (slope above 35%) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbach Weidezaunprojekt 2018, eight participants are currently applying for 24 plots to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.
The area covered is 35 hectares, and the estimated cost is more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Trump ’ s White House is now adopting the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans value them as much as anyone else – hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe into the statue of liberty in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta about the president ’ s proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have lynched him if he had done so.
But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
When Miller called Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. '
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself said, it is not really about history.
It is about contemporary resonance with the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: 'Your pains, your poor, your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely / the miserable waste of your rich coasts'.
There was never a time when the 'miserable waste' was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US.
This conflict, because of the importance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural debate: indeed, it is a conflict over America ’ s importance.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: mother of exiles.
The poem ’ s connection with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people on the right wanted to change it for a long time.
The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives who bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States. '
Quite unusual, Limbaugh found something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the position of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And, of course, that is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.
Their torch should not illuminate the way, but should ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team.
Neil Black, UK athletic performance director, says that the 16-man Scottish contingent in the World Cup will "make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that 'something special is developing in Scotland' and that UK athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find it out," said Black.
"I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. '
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected as team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether Scottish or wherever they live or train, left the room and felt very proud and motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great. '
The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete at her fifth world championship at the 400m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes in the World Cup was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The medium haul driver, Muir, is on this path, setting five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch after a great season of winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in Team Lee McConnell was.
The team captain says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but will also, in some cases, be involved in medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me makes it a very special thing for me," she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise on podiums.
As regards my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think it went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there. '
Block critics on Facebook: Don ’ t ask for public office if you can ’ t stand for voters ’ heating.
The father of our country knew a little about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He shouted at the criticism, certainly.
But he has not silenced his critics.
In 1783, Washington said: 'Freedom of speech can be taken away - and' stupid and mute we are being slaughtered like sheep '.
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogan ’ s staff blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?".
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it is important.
And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and play his hapless head for chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called official and paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan ’ s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions, arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers, or hate filled people who swing the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news programme "The Post".
'I do not appreciate this idea either, when a number of people take a stand on the same subject, they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of citizens'.
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "intercession." ".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or removing a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same thing had been done by sending staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue came last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letterboxes invaded his leadership.
Even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius", and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that laid down Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are at the heart of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club.
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Ireland, which led links to the final round at the Archerfield last year before losing against Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw the renaissance club being built and we see it reaching its fame with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from their best side, it is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He is a keen champion of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. '
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said Southport resident player.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the program the year after I won it.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife, Mrs Sharon, to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate. '
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home soil.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I am glad that this has been done. '
With the trio in the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free, the car park costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer deaths caused by passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer because of passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital in Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) have reached this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are attributable to passive smoking," said head of study Heiko Becher.
In comparison, he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994.
Back then, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Housing connections turn out to be very complex.
Construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is reasonably in time", says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than anticipated, as there is much hidden underground which is not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp construction staff.
"The ignorance of motorists in front of red traffic lights and barrier grids is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite exhausting.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt supplied us with cool mineral water, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
It seldom uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the carved bone is removed and swallowed with diligent, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a rootless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband ’ s four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around after 5 p.m. in the village," she says.
It is a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in public hands before the occupying forces.
An existing movement that stirred up independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which controls the region, excluding foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is deserted.
There is no public transport.
The city, with some 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated sheet roofs, converted by rust into various yellow brown tones.
Few Indonesians have travelled here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
'We used to have only leaves on our bodies. '
Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold country.
The world ’ s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix ’ s McMoran Freeport, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport lost $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
Moreover, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of wood resources.
But these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gooses and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua ’ s tribal hemisphere in the 1970 ’ s became genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We Will All Lose" is a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which contains reports of atrocities committed last year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic trends are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung-Kantinen sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up.
"Migrants have begun selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai resident who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura.
'It has cost local Papua - the mama [the women] of Papua - their market '.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 campaign to address inequalities and violations of rights in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, just two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on their spotlights.
One of the soldiers took offence at their clay and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They performed ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance of Papua ’ s Mee Pago-Stamm in a circle imitating a bird song.
Some demonstrators started throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official TIME document that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for rest and asked the crowd to return home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that it was," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the Papua police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
'It is about life and death. '
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings only came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he is setting up an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000 ’ s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements, but there are processes that need to go through, "he said.
Then Wiranto retreated when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, 'everything is regulated by law', he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of 'crimes against humanity', which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with fierce disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times over the past three years, but no progress has been made," says Yohanes.
'I am tired. '
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I am afraid," he says.
'I am afraid to be arrested by the military, I am afraid to be shot. '
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the corpses, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai ’ s neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a conscientious man to hospital, one person died, and 17 others were injured, including children..
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Well-awaited villagers protested in front of the company ’ s location office.
The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered here quickly, according to the TIME.
'I hid my house for two days'.
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for withdrawing the police mobile brigades from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and arbitrarily detained on the pretext of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is equally out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women, who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between indigenous Papua and the new migrants, who have risen in numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs in the region usually go to the more educated and prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or skills to run their own businesses in a competitive way.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting remain tight on international media.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, even though they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch ’ s deputy Asian director, Jokowi ’ s campaign ’ s promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report about Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesia ’ s government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the 'various and widespread violations' in Papua, including the Paniai Shield.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmanatha Nasir, dismissed the group's accusations and said to journalists in Jakarta: 'Indonesia still has a democratic system and free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases'.
The people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human-rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and afflicted him with 'We want freedom', according to a source that also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai committees," says Gobai, Chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, the Paniai people are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, regard their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must repay.
"They do not need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site precisely opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they do not forget the perpetrators of their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
'What else can we do? '
Fires capture the Dubai skyscraper for the second time.
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high 79-floor building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the tower in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and the cries of the people.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor, "said a resident who named his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units destroyed the fire and cooled the building around 4: 00 a.m. local time (GMT).
The government said that it is working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in areas outside high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the covering, the outer lining for decoration or insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulating and covering the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed around 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has gone through the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup coup.
At the Ho Chi Minh City meeting, the revolutionary proposal that Davis Cup players should only play on two winning rates was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-place classics, which are often very long, but are also very valued for this reason, are therefore retained in the traditional competition.
63.54% of member countries voted for reform, so ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal was barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our members did not accept the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, "said Haggerty.
They will continue to work to improve their applications.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place was not put to the vote.
New from 2018 onwards are only comparatively small details: For example, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host rights in the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce costs for the organisers, the requirements in terms of training places, etc., will be simplified and players will have to make less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 US travelers bring banned items onto the plane, finds out a survey.
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20% deliberately or unconsciously illicit items were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6% who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1% claimed that they were late in discovering that they had travelled erroneously with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers tend to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7% were millennials, compared to less than 15%, who were members of generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% admitted that they had knowingly carried items with blades through the security check, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately put banned drugs on the aircraft.
The company said it had consulted travellers across the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many had deliberately done so.
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry smuggling goods - knowingly or unwittingly - through security were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain about what liquids they can take with them or how much of it.
No surprise, then, that most of the TSA ’ s confiscated items are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn ’ t matter: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel the order.
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to announce with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
In doing so, he has so far denied that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the constantly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has, for the first time, revealed a different, less brilliant figure when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.
Over the past few months, Musk has often advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (1000 US dollars in the USA and 1000 pounds in the UK) "Reservation Deposit".
At present, 455,000 such non-binding reservations were planned, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not with demand, but with production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models taken together - it will be 500,000, and in 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently added per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla is able to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without any major interruptions with maximum utilisation.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become the problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent discontented customers from getting away in droves.
EPA Chairman Pruitt is withdrawing from the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions.
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency ’ s chief, reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce Smog emissions of air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency was more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint brought against his previous post in a federal court of appeal.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time, study the plan, and avoid 'interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth'.
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma ’ s Public Prosecutor prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, was for a long time a staunch opponent of tougher environmental regulations.,, the of, the., the of., the of
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday ’ s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt ’ s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his U-turn on ozone standards simply strengthens the EPO ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by groups of activists and others and, in an agreement, set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in legal regulation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that we have seriously. '
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use its' late power and all other legally available powers' to ensure that the rules are 'based on sound policy and the best available information'.
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader overhaul of ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued EPAs this week, said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - according to our complaints - is an important health and safety benefit for these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power stations, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered about Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
'We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade of bidding polluters and their particular interests. '
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church.
750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a Serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday 16 July at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefit Gallery can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made Tumlingen's friends and patrons their concern.
Walter Martini stresses: "It is a unique village jewel".
In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg Book of Documents: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen along with the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the letter of the document, on the Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, there was also a stately court, to which the church or the patronage right belonged and not the other way round.
People also lived there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt in 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the dominant settlement centre of the village.
Old maps dating back to 1600 underpin these historical realities.
The patronage law originated from the early Middle Ages.
A gentleman who built, equipped and occupied a church with a parish remained the owner of this church and could also inherit it it.
This was accompanied by the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two collapsed at Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell first sounded in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the Thirty Years War (1616 to 1648) the windows were sunk and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796 French troops were stored near the church.
They broke the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilarius was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf, which still exists today, remained as a witness to the 750 year old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cultivate the Hilarius plant as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.
As organiser, the friends and patrons of Tumlingen invite to the sixth Serenade at the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel on Sunday 16 July.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Incoming is from 3.30 p.m.
At the end of the Serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers are hoping for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
Friends and patrons of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to have permission of wind turbines tested
"Boisheim defends itself" does not see any legal precondition for the construction and has therefore approached the councillor.
The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has asked councillor Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines at the Nette Boisheimer.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that, at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at Boisheimer Nette, because at the time only the city border with Schwalmtal had existed a wind power concentration zone in Viersen.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are designed to prevent the landscape from being "saved".
A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Nette Boisheimer - which had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district government because of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of a planning legal basis, the approval decision issued is still unlawful and therefore also withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim is resisting".
Current state of affairs: before the summer recess, the City Council again decided on the wind concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette; the district government has yet to approve it.
Erkens: 'This means that the granting of permission for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law'.
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The relevant letters have been received by Viersen County since last week," said a speaker.
The circle takes them to look again at the matter.
However, they are unlikely to result in the process being stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim wehrt sich" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200-metre windmills on an area of the Nette Boisheimer.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
The construction of the four wind turbines will be able to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest about EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Crack Car and Tractor: Women dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at about 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was killed.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The highway remained closed for hours.
After police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich, accompanied by her car, and her 53-year-old mother, found the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and Dealers Planning "Homeland Ships" Weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping.
As the chairman of the trade association Christian König announced, the "Homeland Shipping" weekend is intended to make customers aware of the offers offered by their own city away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies should present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to be invited to "midnight shopping".
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the weekend of action, according to Christian König.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce.
This means that the trade association and the city will enter another stage of the project "Attractive city centre".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Well Festival and the sale of Sunday, discussions with all traders and hosts to get them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be reopened or re-opened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
However, many locals would also have lost sight of the city center when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revive the city centre, including landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had partly spread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will participate in the third "Heimat-Shoppen" day, nationwide.
Besides Bad Langensalza these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities," he says.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her direct environment through his / her purchasing behaviour.
Two deaths and several injuries following the explosion at US School
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) another injured person was in critical condition.
A person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A missing person was also recovered dead later.
The dead were school employees.
As a matter of accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico for paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of telephone calls.
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President insulted him for publicly denouncing the wall and reportedly said to him: 'You cannot tell the press that'.
Trump started his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the US southern border, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US is "ridiculous," bad, "and" stupid, "and that insistence on trade provided by the Obama administration would make him look like a" depp "after proposing a ban on resettlement of refugees to the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull, 'this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day'.
Moore Ford Massacre: Activists resubmit racist Lynchakt as a call for justice.
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rushed to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windscreen.
Inside, the inmates were frightened.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man shouted.
'Get it out of the car! '
Schreie torn the silence when a young black man was dragged from the front-passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, is just a replay.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience found very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It is truly incomprehensible that in all these years, not a single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organise the repatriation.
'It is a dirt stain on a story, but it is a burden on our souls'.
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a civil rights activist for a lifetime.
For him, deference serves as a dramatic call to action, and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
'We cannot heal and reconcile until we get justice '.
A forensic doctor lays a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Order synthesis on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI files received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although suspects have remained at large for decades, civil-rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch ’ s actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, Roger Malcom, the black farmer, stumbled a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly for a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom ’ s wife Dorothy, and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
'It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses'.
Brooks put it even more succinctly.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
'They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, you will be here.'
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual follow-up of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch ’ s murders.
Their presentation is vivid, moving, and rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It is hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that is the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we are then confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I cannot establish a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have been through".
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - poured into a room and listened when Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said that the role would never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I am not so," said Marbaugh.
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times'.
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who attacks and afflicts Hester, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
'I said n --- he, disappeared from my property! '
Rascona returns fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) breaks out into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
It is alarmed and confused.
Was I too tough?
"No," Greene said, still kicking.
'I simply do not think that white people said 'n --- he'. '
"But", one of the other black actors joked.
'You only have to meet the hard 'R.'.
And that is exactly where the energy in the room is shifting, a feeling of comradeship replaces discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are shootings, shootings and then silence.
A woman dressed with a sorrow stands above the bodies of the actor and performs Billie Holidays's mourning speech "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred metres behind it, a group of around four dozen spectators is sweat and tears out of sight.
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white.
A couple arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are just down the street.
They have experienced Georgian humidity for almost eight hours, when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the killings have remained anecdotal, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch killings took place, the air is ghostly.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children raise their heads, register the falsified blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They are not really dead," a little boy murmurs as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over.
The actors throw away the lynch and wipe out their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down crying in their arms, and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It is okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did so for one reason. '
Later, the audience met the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta excited about the replay with a black pair they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling.
"It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... from people who look like you and who do this because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me leads me to believe that lynching is still going on," she added, "today it is only called a police shooter."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks ’ court holds at his table, eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"Defense is somewhat inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"If we do not learn anything from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it. '
The Wagnerians in Bayreuth reconciled the Dawn of the Gods.
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colourful frivolous staging against a gigantic six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with the wall and dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, there is an open Mercedes classic car park, where the Rhine daughters pose as rock-energy vehicles, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" stag.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize beautifully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a corpse into the boot in Hollywood style and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) still has to believe.
The audience would like to thank the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in a stormy manner, which humbly bows hands to the Merkel-Raute.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing.
The show was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his director.
Five years later, when he had to go on a whistle concert in 2013, there was great jubilation in which the occasional "buh" cries fell.
The director of the festival Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this.
"One realizes that the audience has somehow grown together with the" ring ", she said just before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also an understanding of his view grew.
I would like to draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a Volunteer
They work in several locations during their voluntary year.
Where everywhere?
Lots: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have also been working at school for an open day.
What is your experience with this?
Lots: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years, that is, a late volunteer.
Why?
Lots: I have done an Abitur.
And then, let us say, a civil engineering study has successfully broken off.
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered what you are doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight into it, and you can see how it really is on the ground, perhaps in the focus.
And was it?
Lots: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sphere in the winter semester.
I will study dual, I will probably do a social worker training at the Youth Welfare Office in Herne and I will study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the voluntary service?
Lots: Yes, it is very variable.
It ’ s always important to know where to do your FSJ.
It can be done from retirement homes to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the UCITS, that is to say in the afternoon care.
For me that was exactly the right thing to do.
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Well, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of you, each with a different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, a young person who has been taken out of the family, it is always necessary to deal with this individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of touch?
Lots: I am not the type for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but life is like that.
Pearson is cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting the dividend to revive business.
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72%, as another restructuring program would be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.
The job cuts that Director-General John Fallon announced mostly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 come in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in May, in a third cost-cutting program, a cost reduction plan of £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after it had increased from 1% to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul ’ s Konvoi Attack: NATO Soldier Killed in Suicide
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killed a Nato soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, and a statement by NATO was made.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the Qarabagh district incident.
Bombing is the last act of violence that struck Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
A statement by NATO states that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening, when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was' attacked 'by a' people-supported improvised explosive device '.
It says that all the injured are in a stable condition and are treated in the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a chiefly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since the US-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.,,,,,,,.,,,,,
EPA Reverses Decision on Delaying the Smog Rule after Complaints
The US Environmental Protection Agency has revoked a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration that requires states to contain smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to promote the so-called 'ozone provisions 2015' and said that it is showing the Agency's commitment to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPO ’ s intention to delay the ozone provisions – which aim to measure pollutant emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards – by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has sought to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump claims will boost economic growth.
However, the efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that inhaling air that contains ozone can "reduce the lung function and increase the respiratory symptoms" such as asthma. is.. is in the.. is.. is.
Community area
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a Community area in the future residential complex.
Before the discussion there is an important piece of information: the purchase contract for the missing piece of land has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden...
Although it will take some time before the area previously owned by the parish church is in the parish's possession, there is now no obstacle to planning the project to be put up by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area for this.
One of the two investors still on board offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council would like to see such a common area not just as a meeting place for seniors, but open to the community.
As an example, the word "knitting café" went round.
The decision that was pre-empted by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn is being overlooked by means of support opportunities.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
The creation of a Community area, Tjaden reports, would be eligible for 60% of 30%.
The proposal for a resolution, in order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a stick between their legs in this respect, provides for the observation that both the saddle - which is in line with the surrounding construction - and the pulse roof - which reduces the pitch and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
It is not only Wilfried Sohmer who believes that this addition is unnecessary.,,.
If it helps, it happens unanimously.
The Community area is not so easy.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, which do not make much progress, but the Community area is now being rejected, she says: 'I'.
Yvonne Staiger is very much in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against local participation.
It sees it as a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because the purchase of land does not grant a subsidy, but rather gets a real value that can be marketed in the event of doubt, is the counter-argument.
Mr Staiger's proposal to split the proposal for a decision accordingly has three supporters.
That is how two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes: 'If we take the decision in this way, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure'.
Car collision: Wheelers are thrown on the road.
On Wednesday in Garath, a 82-year-old cyclist was captured and seriously injured by a car while crossing the road.
As the police announced, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had travelled by bicycle on the Schwarzer Weg road from Hilden at 12.20 p.m.
The senior wanted to cross the railway at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfeld took to the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He came together with a car that managed a 66-year-old helper.
The man was thrown onto the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue message.
FC Bayern Munich has to forgo David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund.
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game suck Dortmund.
With staff care the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the trophy winner.
The human resources at the German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 h / ZDF and Eurosport) at the trophy winner Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti has to forgo David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, the Münchners Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
Ancelotti was responsible for the five defeats in the last six test games for the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
That was not good last time. '
The 58-year-old believes, however, in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intensive game ".
The duel of the two German soccer weights captivates the fans.
The game is sold out with 81.360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Moving from Star to Star in the Harz
In the resin the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans this.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "Star Path" met the need for information from many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to set up boards along the planned route and then inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase up to 2018 the association plans "easily accessible installations in five to six places" in Oberharz.
It would be called St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception is important when choosing the location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path of Zug by Zug will be extended.
"On the Star Path the spectators learn a lot worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why a star shines more than another, even though it is much further away.
It will also explain the constellation in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in North Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the National Park Harz is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen with the naked eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar in the United States city to the planned Star Shift - the Planetary Path.
Beginning in front of Gebhardt's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary trail leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "alien" site in Diemarden with the planet Sedna.
The steels with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to dwarf planets at the endpoint - are located exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres.
While light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stand with Pluto.
Pedestrians are thus faster than light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unrivalled World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federgewicht-Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for Pound-Liste.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said: "How do you, Champion?
I wish you good luck. '
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7 p.m. on Saturday evening.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between combatants would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"I am a former feather weight," recalled Garcia.
"I went up for bronze [to 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I am small for 140.
I would like to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That is what the fans are asking for.
Let us give them that '.
Lomachenko agreed.
'Boxes need this fight '.
Klimas asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it," said Garcia, and later expressed openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... '
Garcia said he regards Lomachenko as "a huge fighter," and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the three-fight champion from Riverside look "very slow, I am sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-out".
Garcia said the focus is to show strong, then boxes.
Both said that they could feel the momentum they had built up for their own struggle.
"This is the battle that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on this, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: 'I waited for the top fighters, and that is Mikey.
It will be a great fight. '
Four injured after Reifenplatzer
In an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the Marktbreit junction, presumably after a tyre plater.
The car slid to the right into the slope, where it was overloaded and then lying on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
The A7 was closed for about an hour to the north during the emergency service ’ s first delivery of the injured, and then the traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident site.
Fortuna Hoffmann: 'Triple works better'
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2: 2 season opening against Braunschweig that the optimisation of the defensive formation in Aue points.
Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the first season game, and the result would not have been the two opposing pitches against Braunschweig.
"These were two counterparts too much, and we have to be even more vigilant in Aue," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains the triangle is to be further optimized.
And the fortunes no longer want to capture a goal after a free strike.
'For the future, it will be the case that no one will stand alongside Michael (Rensing). '
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better after the experience in preparing the triple-chain than with the quadruple chain.
"I do not yet know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we just have players in the triangle on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," said Hoffmann.
'It is a prerequisite, but that we harmonise even better and that we do not afford to make so many playback errors'.
Of course Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game.
"Whether one can speak of a failed start after a draw does not know.
The performance could well be okay, "Hoffmann said.
'But if we can stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a good start to the season. '
His trainer didn't want to know about this.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the Sachsen match in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," says Funkel and Hoffmann, who believes that Aue players might even be a little fresher, because they don't have a big and complete game like Fortuna against an upward favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know 100% where they are at the moment," says Fortuna's interior defender.
It is true that the guests from the Rhineland as a light favourite will meet on Sunday in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we claim to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to be beaten from the start," says Fortuna's chief coach.
'To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant '.
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Sweden's Asylum Assessment Tests
Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of people tested are over 18 years old, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Ministry of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the testing last year.
They are intended to make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish migration agency (migration union) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migration Chart has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were rated as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age".
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to have been over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases' suggesting that the person investigated was 18 years or older '.
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases, the person had frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI shots of knee joint are taken, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say it safely, we should not pretend we could, "he said to the newspaper Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case about 10%. '
Full of the Plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstrasse 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-tonne concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it is running super," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road Transport in Freiburg.
In April the work started simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation.
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted arch bridge covered with red colored stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years.
In order to ensure durability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach.
They are made of red colored sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance to the village of Lauterbach received a 1.30 m wide bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning and seven tons of heavy.
This is a border attachment which is also used as a way of operating.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Particular attention has been paid to the installation of pipelines by the Lauterbach building.
This is also where a fibreglass cable runs, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project by hand in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs first had to be fished.
For bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is single-lane controlled by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance the road in the area of the bridge is completely closed at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden".
The total cost of the three reconstruction projects is EUR 700 000.
It is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), it comes together, which otherwise is difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district congress (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance that peacefully shows flag on that day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the poster "Great campaign start".
And well-known names will be launched, such as Alice Weidel, who, together with Alexander Gauland, will be the leading duo for the federal election on September 24, and Beatrix von Storch, Deputy Chairman of the German Parliament.
But those who are already there hours before the event starts want to demonstrate rather than listen to the AfD people.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally the town picnic was planned on the Brunnenplatz under the motto "All at one table", but now takes place in the parking area below the toboggan run - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that comes up there.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the One World Forum and one of the authoritative organizers, is really pleased: "Great how many people have met here".
There is music and a lot of food, including a "German potato salad that the AfD could eat without any problems", says the woman who brought him with him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, and they are mainly present at the railway station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcanic Eifel reported that he was trying to get such an event and was awarded the prize.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but was refused there because of the already built Laurentius church there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
With regard to the event on the Rondellvorplatz he says: "This is the good right of the people, main thing, it remains peaceful".
This is what it does: At around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on Rondellvorplatz, and various speakers in the Stadthalle, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD Chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 people in the Chamber who are waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts for a little more than an hour, the guests on the square have a longer breath, but there is also a need to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can leave - no special events.
The Trompete
A repertoire with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli is available in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert entitled "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and perform solo performances in top European orchestras.
Petkov is Solotrompeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the soloist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach, like in a new guitar, sounds like "World Music" with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz musician Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play combine to form a fascinating total artwork.
This core piece of the programme was premiered this spring with enormous success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more: the Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything, "says Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
'Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think: 'Oh that was cool, what comes next?'.
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was that with her twilight fellow Robert Pattinson, who eventually went sorely apart.
In spite of all this, the brittle performer assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was in love with everyone I've been in.
Or do you think I had played it? '
After their separation Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So I have never been confused or obstructed.
I have never liked to be taken seriously. '
She was particularly affected by this, according to "Bang Showbiz", but in school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a great deal.
When I was eleven, the children told me that I would look like a bust.
I felt really attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think: 'girls, be proud of you!'.
In particular, they do not like to explain their love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And perhaps some people call me thankless, but I do not like having to justify myself to the whole public. '
West Virginia Governor announced that he would change the party.
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening in a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me, "said Governor Justice.
'Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I will tell you that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor. '
The rally broke into jubilee.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
'As a trainer, I would say it is time to play another game. '
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening saying: 'Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again'.
"With only 15 governements and the control of least legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice ’ s announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, the global leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated in sport.
Russia ’ s athletic leader, Dmitry Shylakhtin, said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World athletics championships that his country ’ s withdrawal from sport was correct, and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snatched away gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
'The entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised with itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is redesigned '.
Coe said he was also 'pleased' that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to restore Russia," said Coe.
"In the coming months, we must do everything possible to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system, "he added..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
On Monday, the head of the IAAF ask force, Rune Andersen, said that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Sadly for Missing Soldiers in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, some 1000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Cathedral City under high security precautions.
On the unresolved crash, Secretary of Defense Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she called the two defeated pilots "experts of their field".
"We bow down to this highest sacrifice they made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from Northern Hesse died in Mali, West Africa, on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday accompanied by a death guard of the Bundeswehr.
At lunchtime, only the family members of the church left.
After that, the funeral in the family, the closest friends, representatives of the German Armed Forces and politicians began.
These included Hesse ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Sad guests laid down roses, the family members stood arms in arms at the coffins.
In front of the church Fritzlar and many soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
The Defense Minister of the Ley called the defeated soldiers "highly decorated" and operational experience.
The Tiger fighter pilot was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots in his region.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regime to which the soldiers belong, also said: 'If this occupation could not prevent the crash, no one would have succeeded'.
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: the deployment was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance 'for a country from which we are separated by only two states', she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the German Armed Forces did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik wants no grave beside his wife.
The man of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband ’ s decision, as stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of his unhappy title.
After his wife Margrethe ’ s ascent to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired with the title of "Prince Election".
Since Henrik was not given the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the head of the Danish royal house.
Where the last retirement of the 83-year-old will ultimately be is unclear.
It is not his intention, however, to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French noble family, Margrethe met in London in 1965.
He worked on the theme in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, Prince Henrik had a hard time with the Danes in his nearly 50-year rule.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: 'A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation here for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with that position and not to be ashamed.
These were two mistakes! '
Prime Minister Weil wants a speedy re-election
The CDU and the FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday it was in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her Lower Saxony party had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s government into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official election date, the Red-Green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow single-vote majority in parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition.
Elke Twesten, a former Green MEP, based her move on the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
Christian Democrat leader Björn Thümler would recommend to his group that it be included.
This would give the CDU and the FDP a total of 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament, the SPD and the Greens 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag decide to dissolve itself as quickly as possible.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is expected to decide on on Tuesday the report.
The constitution also provides for the possibility of the parliament withdrawing trust from the Prime Minister and electing a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined in a legally clean manner, "said Thümler.
'All questions will be discussed calmly if they are properly examined in law '.
Thümler called Twestens Schritt "doch etwas kurios".
The politician herself emphasised: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good '.
She was a supporter of black green.
The Greens called on the separatist MEPs to return their country's mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return with immediate effect the mandate she received from the Green Country List," said the regional presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance, Anja Piel, said: 'We greatly regret the decision taken by Elke Twesten'.
She has deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group.
'Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step. '
The SPD Chancellor ’ s candidate Martin Schulz denounces Elke Twesten, a Green deputy from Lower Saxony, as a betrayal of the CDU.
"The behaviour of the former Green deputies in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters, but also betrayal of the Red Green," wrote the German Social Democrats leader on Friday on Facebook.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s decision to re-elect the parliament quickly.
Leaving Twestens costs the majority of the Red Green in Lower Saxony.
The politician, "in her wounded vanity and frustration, puts her personal interests before the good of the country," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to make political capital out of it".
The head of the CDU in Lower Saxony, Björn Thümler, will recommend to his deputies that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU.
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of using personal careers to distort the outcome of the 2013 general election.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament.
Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Christian Schmidt (CSU), Minister of Agriculture, is speaking and answering in an interview with the German editorial network (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de the federal states provide the latest information on the respective eggs batches.
The eggs affected should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, there is virtually no danger to health.
Does Aldi now accept the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the Federal Minister of the Economy does not really perceive the central role of the enlightened?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my House immediately turned its attention and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became aware of Germany's concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe to transport.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg, they are not transportable.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it is not the companies that are to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production companies are not directly to blame.
On the contrary, they have to reckon with economic damage as a result of alleged illegal practices by service companies. are. are. are,,,,,
As always, there are too few inspectors in case of emergency.
Is it simply a lack of staff or even of conclusive competence?
It was precisely the official controls that uncovered the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that it is crucial to provide consistent information on such events and to pass it on to the public prosecutors in cases where there may be criminal offences.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the authorities responsible.
Is it really necessary to keep food scandals on a regular basis?
Consumers have the right to have only safe and transport food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The muddled means have put producers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be made clear that the illegal use of Fipronil insecticide in keeping food suppliers is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with great pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to provide speedy and complete information.
How Football ’ s Financial Rules Impact Neymar ’ s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spain ’ s Barcelona to France ’ s Paris-Saint Germain.
There will be some consequences for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar ’ s transfer was financed with little loss.
Barcelona has paid €222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signs up and takes him into a galaxy of other stars, given the team ’ s funding from the energy-rich Qatar ruling family.
Clubs may spend a lot of money on buying players, but must counteract with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break even in their soccer business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - buying a potentially strong club and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher business.
During the current three-year FFP hiring period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million.
And, while Platini was disgraced by the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to discouraging excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the replacement fee for the next five years, amounting to EUR 44.4 million, can be recorded in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, who holds Manchester City, struck the PSG with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of €60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outlist their financial supervision by blowing up their revenues from companies associated with club owners.
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments could come to Neymar via payments made by the World Cup Organization Committee in 2022.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors, and that such a maneuver could easily be found for UEFA regulators.
Previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press under anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising, and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports team, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country. '
Swiss is Looking for a New Shoggilist
In recent years Chocolat Frey has produced Bord chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "North-West Switzerland" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very pleased with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
Approximately 17 million small red and white shock panels of 14 grams per year distribute the cabin crew to the passengers prior to landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide information on the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "North-West Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss Francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss Francs.
But what is more important is the advertising effect: for a shoe manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate tables on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with Migros ’ daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had delivered the chocolate tablets.
Two and a half years ago, Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be spoiled with delicacies from the Sprüngli Confiserie, in Business Class from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed by Chocolat Frey on the short-haul route, both in business and economy class.
athletics - Discussion Olympic Champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympics winner, had failed in the national World Cup squeeze, and could only look at the discus race from the gallery.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters wide, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche of "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective".
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s Grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to make larger things.
As a cultural artefact it is also a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables, spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By getting stuck to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless made it impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more by the scattering principle, including a reef on the Stalker movies of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character groves through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy malicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the courses are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's beard of "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old crackdown.
These are the moments of accidental madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", the last scene of which the bands will show how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-west wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism.
The main characters - a hardened Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'Find the Voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like one.
In six long episodes, the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited to a lesser length, could better deliver his agitprop series, as Gregor and Iosef visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed a jelly.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we are even doing it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Killing Drug Mafia in the Land
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor ’ s office in Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused people aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants were issued against them.
The officials also secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two Italian suspects.
The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The Mafia's members are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.
Since summer 2016, the prosecutor ’ s office has been investigating Konstanz against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
The prosecutors in Constance and Palermo were in close contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
That is why the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four Palermo officials.
The investigation was directed mainly by Italian nationals closely related to the Italian mafia.
Another incident in Hüfingen on 27 May, during which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to be the result of the gang.
There are major gaps in the foreign register.
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the register of foreigners in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government ’ s representative for the management of refugees, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to major gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to 'sometimes serious mistakes' in asylum procedures and deportations, warned in an analysis presented in the 'Süddeutsche Zeitung'.
According to the data, the register contains ten million people of foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data was not maintained sufficiently, the quality of the data has not been good in parts.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, 'by people who are no longer alive or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should not actually appear in the register'.
"Incorrect data input can slow back processes considerably," the report goes on.
Moreover, statistics on people who are forced to leave include EU citizens who do not need to leave.
However, such false allocations' led to a distorted debate on how to deal with those who have to leave ', according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government appears to have begun sending refugee families with under 16 years of age back to Italy once they have arrived from there.
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper therefore states that the BAMF 'has been carrying out such procedures for families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017'.
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Convention, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state, which they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
To justify this, the office now writes: 'In the meantime, the absorption capacity of families with underage children has increased significantly in Italy'.
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, the spokesperson for domestic politics in the Bundestag, criticized this decision: "Families with children are threatened with inadequacies in the Italian asylum system and with inhumane reception conditions and a threat to children's welfare".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided the blood donation service to other people.
At least among the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all, Jürgen Greule, who, with his now 100 donations, now shared 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the Council of the Municipalities, the municipality acknowledges the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for this purpose and we respect the donors who provide their blood for strangers, not to mention altruistic," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, the district governor of the German Red Cross (DRK), for the cannons are crushed into their constituents.
Three people could benefit from blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the head of the DRK Association.
Apparently, the change to the theatre house led to higher attendance numbers a few years ago.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 donations each.
Half as many Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger stayed, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave them 500 milliliters each of their life.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%.
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation slowdown have dampened speculation about rising.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" by maintaining interest rates on family income in the midst of intensifying pressure.
Bank Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7%, and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the next few years to rein in Brexit ’ s fueled inflation, and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call for time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - GBP 115 billion sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, GDP remains weak in the short run, as pressure on real household incomes continues to impede consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that 'some tightening of monetary policy' would be needed to cool inflation and a 'slightly greater' level than the markets expect.
Markets are forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
The Bank ’ s downward adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next year are relative to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has kept its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31, falling by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision cannot be changed after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest-rate hike, and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to reach 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank at the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage increases, because the tightening first gets worse before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the loss of income in the next few years, but she added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will offset part of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August, following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve this fully in terms of prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank ’ s latest judgment on interest rates, the call for an interest-rate hike had risen, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell last month, from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and that it will recover in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its 2% target was' entirely 'attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders are clamoring for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who end the existing deals and make the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more popular. '
The National Health Service (NHS) is to prescribe a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people.
Patients will have access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September onwards, following a fight in front of the High Court against funding for the drug in the NHS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NHS England announced that preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86%, is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as "an important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a "decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and other clinics will follow in October, before it will be launched across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person ’ s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as targeted, absorbed, and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in tackling one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity. '
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted at people in need and danger, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is genuinely individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. '
Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly throughout the country and for no one who is at risk of HIV to be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are well on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. '
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us move one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society '.
Living the Great Life: The mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.
"Before that I lived with my ex-in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. '
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the spacious ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To this end, she asked Erfan Azadi ’ s Duck & Shed Architecture and Design studio in Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to put ourselves together.
It was not just a question of building a simple platform, but of creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. '
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other in full height, with a lot of drama.
For the mezzanine floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses from Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering art went there," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door.
'It is counterweight so that when you push the door up, it slides very easily '.
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is estimated," Erfan says.
'In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter into a calculation based on the size of the land '.
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You do not fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
They are important, but they do not play with your heart. '
It shows that a flat can turn from something standard to something quite amazing due to good design and increased square meters.
Indeed, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers Fight for a $500 million Real Estate Imperial
Two brothers are in conflict four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, over $500 million worth of one of Victorian ’ s largest real-estate empire.
Former director of the Carlton football club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a clash over separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 homes worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis ’ portfolio now includes urban offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centers.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
According to a legal act, this means that Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul $176 million worth.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of administering some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs will rise in this case, with hundreds of Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a Brunswick shop in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood store where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years high school, when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Lukas and Mark, Paul says, have become embittered about the terms of their financial separation.
Colin was very reticent, even though he was a former AFL board member and, after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really cannot say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our surname through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother ’ s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution".
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts," wrote Colin.
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House ’ s new chief of staff, met senior executives on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that comes into the president ’ s hands.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"When candidate Trump was angry for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of posts that were to be persuaded," said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that, "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption is consistently praised."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we others do not know – that without their interventions, Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel.
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If his colleagues have managed to keep him out of trouble several times, their efforts have paid off.
But no one has been consistent in preventing Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing parties, people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting material to Trump that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the advisers' preference to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is keen to find out where they come from.
This was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson ’ s website, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter for harassment, or has offered no concrete evidence, or has made false accusations and revoked them in the past.
Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter “tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives. ”
How did this work?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than primebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult.
Europol's mail to the most sought after criminals
Since the address is unknown, the support of the population is being sought and hoped for.
Police across Europe this summer sends (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
As the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are by definition unknown, evidence from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday the action following the 'EU Most Wanted' winter advent calendar.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, as Europol said.
21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled.
Since 2016 the website www.eumostwanted exists, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
36 of the online enquiries have so far been arrested, at least eleven of them due to information after publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the Millionaires series.
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are once again at war with some determined travellers who negotiated a ditch drawn from the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy Solihull street called the "Millionärs" series.
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained untouched to find a way.
Angry residents have afflicted the advice of Solihull, who said that 'it is useless to deal with the problem'.
An anonymous resident said: "They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
Travellers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably more today. '
She added: 'The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by making long instructions to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it. '
A resident who did not want to be called said: 'It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area. '
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and we are working with the Solihull police and we are taking the necessary legal steps to move forward as quickly as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101..
This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the Court will have to examine when we will present our case. '
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise.
The Waldhotel Luise becomes the former Hotel Birkenhof.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
After all, with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH as of 13 April 2014, around 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time and income from the spa tax was also lost.
In the autumn of 2014, with dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the councillor ’ s office as a collective shelter, causing controversy.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the municipal council.
But Freudenstadt ’ s Lord Mayor, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel ’ s location and spoke of serious interest in the hotel back then.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels Group, with its managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has bought the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star plus hotel under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the pleasure city object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof building waste containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were removed, ceilings partly removed, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
Much remains to be done by March.
"It's actually a beautiful hotel", says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautifully close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
'We want to make a jewel out of it '.
Swimming pool, wellness area and meeting room are all equipped..
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a higher level of the inner city, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, aims to set itself wide, explains Scherer.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.
'We are on the same line '.
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise.
Less than a million euros, he calculates.
The outside areas are also being brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace is created in the courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: United States Special Counsel sets up the Grand Jury
In the Russia affair involving US President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reported to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury.
The panel has started work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the issue.
The newspaper viewed the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
The CNN channel reported that there are already preliminary subpoenas of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who campaigned as Republican advisers.
Mueller has reportedly been more and more scrutinizing Trump ’ s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Trump, the special counselor, had put himself at the center and investigated whether the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to bring charges.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Chambers of Appeal.
Most of the time they are switched on when there are major and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The board can also be consulted by the public prosecutor to invite people to interrogate under oath.
According to the CNN channel, lectures have already been issued on the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who took part in the meeting were asked to make a statement, as the report says.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his campaign chief, Paul Manafort, were on the conversation.
On Thursday evening, legal experts said on US television that the appointment shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be consulted at the end in order to decide whether to bring an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the start of a new phase in the investigation and a new source of concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech on Thursday evening in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia's history is a complete invention," Trump said.
The issue gives the democrats a chance to 'feel good because they have nothing else to talk about'.
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury.
But they usually work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Counsel in a 'fair' way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that the president is not being investigated.
There is no reason to believe that this has changed, the statement continued.
But Mueller was only deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Trump had been accused of obstructing the judiciary because of this overthrow.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the Special Counsel and its staff.
That triggered speculation about whether Trump would sack Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special envoy, such as the Watergate affair surrounding later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which, theoretically, at the president ’ s insistence, he could be fired by the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Thursday that would make it less easy to dismiss the Special Counsel.
Antarctica ’ s Gigantic Ice Mountain Drives in Antarctica
In the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has got rid of its shell.
This was announced on Wednesday by the Bremen Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research.
The colossus weighing more than one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
It is one of the largest ice giants registered by researchers over the past three decades, with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres.
It does not pose a danger to people.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear according to research.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice cubes in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a background of facts.
According to many researchers, this could be linked to global warming.
The colossus that has now been aborted has been part of the larsen-C shell.
Schelfeis swim on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north of this shell, the balance of growth and breaking was disturbed some years ago.
A complete shell has broken up there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to be said about the fact that the larsen-C shell is also in danger, because the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is today.
In addition, the ice sheet is under stress and may collapse if a piece of ice breaks off at a key point.
The melting of the shell and iceberg does not raise the sea level, as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it does after melting.
However, the loss of the skeleton ice means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This may increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the UK ’ s Midas research project.
According to AWI-data, the Larsen-C skeleton is the fourth largest skeleton in the Antarctic with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
There it stops regularly.
"Although it is natural and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in the UK.
"This is the furthest withdrawal since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is contentious whether the Larsen-C shell will now grow again or fall in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: 'Our models say it will be less stable'.
But it will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a great many icebergs of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades.
This long tip of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the last 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperature is rising fastest.
CDU ’ s Household Tariff for Personnel
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant posts, the CDU is calling for the resignation of the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer recess, the Kreistag has completed 41 new administrative posts.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 apprentices have their first day of work behind them.
The apprenticeships at the district are obviously very much in demand.
Approximately 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
At present there are still 50 unfilled posts in the Mettmann circle.
Doctors and engineers as well as general administration staff are requested.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the district parliament and to address the shortage of skilled workers in administration.
In accordance with the wishes of the parties, the administration shall "develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of candidates in the future, it is said.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, should show concrete measures for cross-frontier entrants and should include a training offensive, CDU, FDP and UWG demand.
That sounds like a good approach.
After all, the circle is dealing with personnel problems that were previously unknown.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of real 'competition between public employers'.
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is therefore high time to act so that more jobs do not remain vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, the leader of the CDU group, and his party go beyond the joint motion.
He recently caused a fistful surprise in the district parliament when he publicly questioned the staffing ceiling and startled the other parties.
Peoples want to see a review of all the possibilities that allow them to leave the local employers' association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the trade unions, perhaps also in cooperation with the nearby cities," says peoples.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the collective agreement for the public service actually provides for.
Wages are currently strictly prescribed, and increases or more money can only be achieved by moving to a higher level, based on years of work.
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown ever more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on the protection of prostitution.
Not least because of the increase in the number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy Strengthening the Mind of NGO Migrant Rescue Bo
Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue unless they adhere to new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rettet aid organisation, because its team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in a statement on the social media.
'We cannot judge any allegations currently made until we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation '.
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that its crew will take on board migrants who are supplied directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be reused.
At least such a meeting was supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor ’ s file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian coastguard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta, and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring about 'major changes or obstacles' of their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner is Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescue operations has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libya ’ s coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In recent days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives, and with Chad, Niger, and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Upgrades and Trials
Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
Accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome addition.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It was followed by observation points, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there have always been prolonged increases for which long trials have been rewarded.
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and to the folk feast sausage market.
Once again, the viewpoint stood at the viewpoint, connected by "floating" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days, a lot of altitude meters were planned.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and caves brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed salt in the open-air inhalatory.
New Town has also been fired.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group got to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of grass - Bundesliga is Arming for E-Sport
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of having to fight over the stadium pits in the wind and weather?
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high profits.
This is also recognised by the first Bundesliga leagues, which are increasingly committed to this area.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and, most recently, VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB", says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there are still a number of clubs on this train".
Next weekend, FIFA World Cup in London is organising the first Interactive Club World Cup, where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds in particular, that young people will continue to enter the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be present on these markets online much more often than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is this about?
In e-sports, computer games such as League of Legends, Dota 2, Counterstrike or FIFA football simulation are fought at competitive level.
As in normal sport, leagues have long established themselves in which professionals compete against each other.
And E-Sport is already part of the official program for Asian games in 2022.
But is it really a sport?
For many, the idea certainly needs to be used.
Ingo Froböse also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - e.g. increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid response capability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.
'The fit player is a good player '.
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to implement in online games, and the structures of classical sport were lacking in the scene.
On the positive side, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are on the international stage, which is like a big global family, and there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, this amounted to €50 million in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship, and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
This is not the case with the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the football league.
However, e-sport is "not far away from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are already on the international stage.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-baseball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actress Ashton Kutcher invests in the e-sports betting provider Unikrn.
There are also things happening in Europe.
In a Norwegian school e-sport has been introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse..,,,,,,,,,,, and.,,,
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"Germany is lagging behind in the European comparison," explains VfB-Executive Board Röttgermann.
It is no longer enough to fall into nostalgia, and to paralyse the old times.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
'You cannot hold on to the fact that only football is the way it has always been '.
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
Almost all the Länder are now affected by the poisoned eggs scandal.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and removed all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs are to be placed on the shelves that have proven to contain no fipronil.
Michelle Carter has been convicted of the texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months condemning them behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: 'My family is unblemished.
My son was my best friend. '
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had a mental illness.
Closed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands, and downward eyed eyes when she was convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility, "she said.
'She has shown no remorse '.
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible circumstance that she deeply deplores."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said that he did not find out that their 'age, maturity or even mental illness have a significant impact on their actions'.
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy ’ s mother, Lynn Roy, saying that “there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything, and I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we will bear for eternity, "he says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "persecuted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be a aunt for his children.
"Not having this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that it had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, spring from a building, swallow yourself, I do not know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: 'You have to do it, Conrad' and 'All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy'.
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter were Amanda Knox, convicted in 2007 of murders of her fellow British citizen in Italy, before being released two years ago.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: 'Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment'.
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the FC Bayern Mini-Lahm
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to be a captain at the Audi Cup.
The FC Bayern believes the Confed-Cup winner has a great season - there is no harm to any extra motivation.
Something else was there on his seat in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since no Philipp Lahm was seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup and no Manuel Neuer was seen either, he made the binding to him.
"The coach has not announced it", the Confed-Cup winner told us after his first assignment as Bavarian capital.
Well, the booth could have been better than the 0: 2 against the SSC of Naples.
But Kimmich could interpret the sign of the coach as well.
It was not Arturo Vidal, who was eight years old, who was chosen to play in the C-Elf, which was made up of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come out of the holiday.
It is preferable to distribute sugar to those who are trusted to have a great deal of pleasure.
So if you were chosen to take up the legacy of Lahm, you can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flipped over the field as a mini lamb.
Right back, that's its position now, the white tie on the arm did the rest.
And Kimmich even worked like the one who can best take the helmet in this starter formation.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unplayed troop.
He looked at the whole thing, while many others looked at himself.
Vidal was playing his lack of fitness (barely worked); Renato Sanches was hitting out with the achievements of the Asia trip (only conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did not turn out negatively in their first appearance in the Bavarian thriller.
After all, that worked very well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereign.
The famous Napoli Storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to succeed a few times in the construction of the game.
His colleague, Mr Rudy, admittedly admitted that the result was' not as we hoped it would be '.
But he, too, showed a good performance at the debut.
Relocation of the game, change of tempo: "I was brought up for this style".
After the match, we saw how unusual this Bavarian world is for the new entrants.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven interviews.
Kimmich quit after a few tough statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what goes on here.
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game ".
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba Motivates Austrian Women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria ’ s most famous footballer registered on Twitter just before the match and wished the ÖFB-ladies well.
The Bavarian regional is almost a club member of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is fevering with our Ladys.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winners should be a special injection of motivation.
Our ladies may well need the famous Bavarian shower.
Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economics praises Wissings Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economics at Rheinland-Palatinate.
This is apparent after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Volker Wissing (FDP), is in office.
At T V, chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy - and at the same time accuse the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association Trierer Unternehmen (VTU), says: "Wissing picks up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy: closing the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now high on the country ’ s priority list.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure to be followed, and construction law will be in place by 2021.
The West Trier bypass also plays a role in the country ’ s plans, which is the primary requirement of the federal transport route plan.
The aim is to start the route in December 2020, says Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine, as suggested by Wissing, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been taking off for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, praising the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
It is planned to receive a premium of EUR 1000 for the completed master examination and EUR 2500 if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master training.
But the country ’ s homework list remains a long one.
The plan to build a road quickly creates facts and at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to hire mobility at the national plant, up to now only 29 jobs have been filled.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, the CDU Group vize, points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that in 2017 and 2018, the country will invest more than EUR 20 million less in maintaining roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a country ’ s concept of how to address the region ’ s shortage of skilled workers.
It is also sobering that the country has so far expanded its broadband network.
In 2016, regional companies had rated the power supply in an IHK survey with only a 3.4 rating.
They complained about stalling Internet connections and breakdowns.
On the other hand, former Minister of Economic Affairs, Eveline Lemke, is now out of politics and is still on the board of the wind turbine company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe - where, after four months of disagreement, she had already left the field.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash.
One day before Audi announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of the BMW Group said that the company considered that 'there are smarter options than driving restrictions', referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles will be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the enterprise as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing systems for neutralising the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which was able to regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices to comply with the rules when a car has been tested, but to drive back in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees of Volkswagen have been accused, while others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi ’ s engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
Audi ’ s involvement in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury automobile manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profits.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar.
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the visitors of the Isar can take part, a raft will run through Munich tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
When it comes to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a big float between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
In particular, the building department wants to enlighten.
On the raft you can see a large information transparency.
It shows a mountain of rubbish.
The start of a public relations campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
The motto "True love is..." is to sharpen our understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river.
As early as last summer, the raft crossed the Isar and this year, there are other actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious attitude.
Mordillo ’ s Crystal Places and Laughter Against Disease
Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoon artists, and his characters' bones are his trademark.
Even with 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: laughter, 'because there is too much suffering in the world'.
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his early years as an artist, he worked as a drawing for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job," he once said.
After graduating in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures appear in drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he is still sitting at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plushy toys and watches, his drunken figures continue to be widely spread worldwide.
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand feet as an opponent.
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is scheduled to appear on the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordless.
Provence ’ s Lavender Threat to Climate Change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-related conditions and disease insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change, which brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. '
And the stakes are high.
Lavender soles attract not only tourists, but also perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long ears of plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. '
The solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the ground, but also planting with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year existence this year.
This Saturday and Sunday is the peak of a medieval festival.
Crams, guilds, merchants, vagabonds or a land trolleybus are to be seen in the city centre these days.
A journalist ’ s assassination highlights Mexico ’ s growing threat.
Riodoce weekly workers usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials, and relentless drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children into office, which in 2009 was the target of a grenade attack, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and belly feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s payroll or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous.
There is no respite from violence, and while bodies are piling up across the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 have been under federal protection following attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
Its absence is deeply felt, although its presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor ’ s Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, the latter, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists ’ killers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa ’ s violence, even though they are inconsistent, and even though the terrain is now more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
'Until we know why, we distrust everyone. '
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the provincial capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to travel a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced from his car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which is translated as "Twelve River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlegrounds, as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa, every day, one or more people are shot on the streets, or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, which are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of calm when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was blamed for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought up each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $50 holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to discuss.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You have to do the job you do as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I do not want to be asked: 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why did you not say what was going on?'
The Riodoce team miss Valdez, the funny bird who could curse like a dock worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his destruction?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"You don't like it when you are dealing with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, 'smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier.'
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials reside.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where Riodoce staff met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed, and it was announced days earlier that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were mandated by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Halfway through the joke, some reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50% of the policemen that the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountains, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has clicked on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the governor ’ s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor ’ s office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have regarded Valdez ’ s column as the most informed source of abduction.
"Previously, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body stature..
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken up '.
The Valdez office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against journalists ’ killings, because the staff have become something they would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing "SOS Press" on the streets and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away from Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and murdering them for telling the truth.
Since then, she has asked for it to be reorganized by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are being killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces, who were under the cover of organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Their body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel: 'Here I am because of my reports'.
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled 'What do you want from us?'
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile and they are still watching the streets and looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as appears to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 in a home in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz, along with four women.
For those who stay behind and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking frightens him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office on the pavement and drank beer when all their phones suddenly started to bump.
A number of shootings with band-rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel ambassadors in the region.
From the edge of the brook, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens hooked up nearby - another shooting facility in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the police who kept guard to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they did not show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"How can you think of closing this," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade his enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as "the dinosaur's Mona Lisa.".
It was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said they had had something of a "restless past".
The report in the magazine Current Biology called it "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurians who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well preserved state has startled researchers who describe it as' truly remarkable '.
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of the earth ’ s shrimp.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little with your eyes, you might almost think it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
'It will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs. '
Researchers have found that, despite being covered with armor and resembling a changing tank, this herbivore was likely to be threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have made it possible to mix better with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered counterfeiting, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that dinosaurs were hunted by sufficient pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored veiling confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals using countershading – think of roe, zebras, or belts – are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was facing a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been during the Cretaceous Period," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for information about its life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it eaten as its last meal.
They believe that when he died, the dinosaur was flown into a river and driven out to the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it was in the early Crescent period.
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just look a little with your eyes, you might almost think that he is sleeping. '
The Crescent era was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived for millions of years in Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
Scientists whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology journal believe that Borealopelta was diluted in the sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub up on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
Creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long on average, weighing up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch peaks that stood on its shoulders.
Researchers believe that the armored herbivore was flooded by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur ’ s underwater burial kept its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a gain in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Aucted remains of the skin still cover the woody armour plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forehead is on his side, his five fingers are spun upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole '.
In Storm: Mass Carambolage on A8: Many injured
Thousands of accidents on Thursday evening on the A8: Less than 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are many injured, kilometres of traffic jams and gadgets.
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), around 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg), almost 30 vehicles, probably including trucks, were interlocked during a thunderstorm.
The exact number of injuries was not reported at first.
It is light to medium injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometre backlog was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive obstacles on the opposite track - due to a large number of visitors.
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle stewards, who now face severe penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
This resulted in a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests' Comfort Check-in '
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you sit in the train and sleep with nothing in suspense.
Or you are deepened in his work and just have a brilliant idea.
And then: pufff.
Comes the creator and awakens a gently or tears the passenger out of the work.
Ticket control.
But the interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the seamless ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus devalue the ticket.
Currently, a test operation runs on two tracks.
"If the offer comes up, we extend it.
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany, "said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort Check-in" is the name given by the train to the depreciation of the ticket without the conductor.
However, in order to be able to use them, a number of conditions have to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
You also have to buy it via the train App, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way to book your ticket.
Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you get into the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic validation will appear for test customers.
On their mobile devices, train attendants receive a notification that passengers X are on the train and have taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives in place Y at ticket control, he knows that a passenger is there with an online ticket that has already been devalued.
So you can sleep, continue working, keep quiet.
Check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should benefit passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train attendants, just check in at the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time on the train, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often travel on the railways know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the biggest annoyances. are.
Often, but in any case, one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or any other document you need to present.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or in the large room and delays in controlling your own ticket, and ultimately takes the time for the creators to deal with other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet available.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, she sat in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street," they said.
Confused because nobody else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mon.
He posted an image of Brown ’ s lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police band and people shouting, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who bore a sign saying: 'Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!'
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unleashed his rifle and shouted: 'I will kill you... animals all'.
"This is not customary," Ferrell recalled her statement.
'This is not the kind of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call typical '.
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the next morning they would go to Ferguson.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas since the 11th century.
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, they discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state «.
"You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I could not take her with me, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.
She must know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, know not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to be free, to free ourselves.
Although I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman child.
I feel I would be doing her a disservice to keep her away from it. '
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who had lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, and notes that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. '
Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question was put to Ferrell: 'Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?'
This skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people, often whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview, 'We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centrate their voices and we wanted to do it differently'.
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals, followed the Whose Streets team in the years following Brown ’ s shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us," DaviDavi.
'That was the main thing for me how these people are presented, because that is how I will be presented '.
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from Whose Streets show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
Moreover, Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in managerial positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. '
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because there is so much at stake in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman.
You can feel your energy through the screen. '
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is suspended for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
However, she clings to a song and feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. '
From Dream to Size: TV readers discuss Bit Gallery.
The Bit Gallery moves people even though it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
There is hardly one cold issue.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the Bit Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "Needs no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply "megalomania" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, benefiting the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bloom.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the site where the farm market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will be the end of the construction process.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmhouse market hall almost weekly for many years.
Our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women, are always very welcome.
We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the gallery has been built.
Other cities also have this.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. '
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
However, I do not think this will be very low in the new project. '
Eva Kilic: "What shopping malls in Bitburg?
Whether it is clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I find that superfluous.
There are already enough of this in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.
It is a pity that there are almost no more special shops and that what remains of them will probably disappear. '
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not suit me.
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farm-market hall be located during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or is the Ghost Bit Gallery already managing to sell all shops from Bitburg? "
George Marquet: 'That will simply not work.
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the madness of many - I think - useless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farm market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. '
An Appropriate Similarity: Artist Creates Portraits with Chelsea Manning ’ s DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from chelsea slippers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning., and.,,,,,,,,,,,
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publishing classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined their expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he had only three days left.
Dewey-Hagborg, through algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning, from which 30 portraits of how someone might look with these genomic data, has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud, and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo - a grained, black and white Selfie, in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2010 project Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts, such as cigarette dumb and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of what those people might look like.
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal correspondents who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
Indeed, just a few days after the book was published, Obama would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is still some depth and strength at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweet-capable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to address.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a given reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is embroidered with a heart), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist ’ s highly developed scientific lexicon) to show how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
'DNA data can tell so many different stories, so there are 30 of these stories. '
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the aforementioned comic novella.
She shows Manning how she appears like King song with a hands-on phone from the disciplines of the United States.
"When they cold your speech, they won," it says.
'Never stop talking '.
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
'I still get goose butter when I talk about it '.
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as predictably anticipated in the comic book - but if it should, it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by its own genomic simulacres, which collide like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
'I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind its liberation. '
Professor of Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee looking for killing.
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are being sought as suspects after a man was stolen in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with lethal injuries.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murders for alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as evidenced by the acts of the Court of Cook County.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Agency states that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been certified and has been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A university spokesman and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that 'we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in every way possible'.
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to face.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he is urging suspects to face up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional, and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to the residents: 'The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.'
'We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future '- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for restoring Russia ’ s anti-doping agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the roadmap criteria, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for reintroducing RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, there is nothing that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: 'We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted an error.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist. '
Mutko ’ s words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia ’ s independent anti-doping commission.
When talking to the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.
In November 2015, following the doping scandal, RUSADA was excluded from conducting doping controls in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
Following a visit by the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being
That was shared by the business groups.
It is a purely precautionary measure, as the communication says, that no further damage to health can be assumed.
From now on only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fipronile-containing anti-Läusemittel.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next ubiquitous.
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your employees in your e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or, worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.
She has called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-Suite executives and directly address the board of directors.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analysis tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to snap surveys and surveys by certain teams, it offers a company heat card that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill why.
Companies are coming to see that they must stay at the top of the workplace culture, so that you do not become the next man involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation, and compliance could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity early this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customised "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotts, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters.
In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email to the headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff.
Now that the company employs Convercent, problems previously hidden by leaders who sat in offices in cities or states, such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices, can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes'.
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the Social Media to get their act together, and companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that meets the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzers secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing set of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that listens to their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well.
If third party analytics tools promise to increase employee involvement and commitment, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee involvement according to the experts of the workplace culture important.
But the data are useless if a company ’ s managers do not take action.
Indeed, if a company asks employees for your feedback, they can expect change to be on the way.
And if change is not rapid enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Kotter International Business Management Company, which has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you do not follow staff will ask," Did you really hear me?
Are you concerned about this?
And who you do not care about it, why should I? '
Madison Reed, who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, according to Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, thanks to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company keeps getting new insights into its employees, and hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better retention of employees in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team's new practice fields on the campus.
Some have removed their tricot parts and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a large part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6: 30 the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," said Bruins trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
For this reason, the UCLA ’ s first three training sessions should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the players ’ busy schedule.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season, and practiced during the summer school for the first time during Mora ’ s six seasons in Westwood.
They are expected to hold 18 exercises during August, 20 before the formal game preparations begin for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the NCAA ’ s rule change, even if they added another point to the players ’ busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they continue to placate, they are great people.
I think that once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great. '
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task, given the clear lines of its fields, from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upper class that has already been fired with footballs clearing a safety net behind a gate post.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it is quite a good business.
But we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I am therefore not too concerned.
We have a plan. '
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking efforts to combat counterfeit news.
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to fact-checking auditors from third parties and then display their results under the original contribution, said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin to use updated machine learning methods to detect possible falsehoods and send them to fact-inspectors who may display the results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distributions for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled postings, as they did before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
"In addition to recognizing which stories are challenged by third-party fact-checking experts, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "related article" and work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has lived through 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy home in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaaric Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he sadly says.
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands. '
A Castle in England spans the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney.
It is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there.
Oh, I love archives! '
For someone who is so old that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting"), all this seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyan heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries digging.
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape lovers, gardeners and sometimes artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "whiskey and began to write".
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, because the National Trust only gained full access in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees began to look at the archive he described as "hundreds of years when aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the roof. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who possessed what: "You could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to which two families fought.
Young, let everything go! '
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for a wider immersion into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Perhaps the two are connected? '
Other stories are deeply rooted in the castle's history, such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks, borrowing time and money for things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys, with a talent to promote grandchildren. "
After the end of his visit to the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like: 'Oh, now I have to deal with the condemned life again'.
Campaign Launched: More than 300 Years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf Shattered
With the covering of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand on Friday.
Until Thursday, mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or? ", the promoters have been asking on posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel since yesterday.
"We don't really think this (of course!)," they write on their website, which was yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we firmly believe that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know full well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city. '
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is necessary to make a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique feature".
After all, it is in competition with other communities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost an average five-digit amount of its new roof brand and campaign.
Turkey's Military Reform - Erdogan's Army Fear
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and promotion in the officer corps.
This week too.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine among the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff's building, as it used to be, but in the Prime Minister's office.
The five Vice-Premier and Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government.
As a result, the civilian population in the YAS was in excess.
The government is tightening up the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup, Prime Minister Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army, mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan views as the leader of the coup attempt.
There have been negotiations in Ankara since this week against 486 people who are alleged to have been directly involved in the coup attempt.
Even the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt a “gift of God, ” because he gave him the opportunity to“ clean up ” the armed forces completely.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper Hürriyet published an article entitled 'Unease in the Military Headquarters'.
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamicisation" of the army, manifested among other things in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the big cleaning up of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered a further 7395 civil servants to fire, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
Erdogan seemed to have tamed the military.
The generals were once considered to be the real masters of the country.
Three times they cleansed, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After winning in 2002, Erdogan gradually pushed back the military ’ s power, not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reform agenda.
Former officers say that Erdogan is purposefully pushing forward Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a non-named officer, who sought asylum abroad following the attempted coup for fear of persecution, warned that in a few years' time the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and salafists."
If so, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, after the purges, there are doubts in the alliance about the Turkish army ’ s readiness to intervene.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," says NATO diplomats.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
'This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way in which green cards are issued to citizens from other countries. '
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry of Renewal Track for Racetrack Huts
Over the past few months we have been arguing about the future of the racetrack hut - now it's time to go fast.
Before the end of the year, construction is to be carried out on the crumbling route on which the tourist train runs.
In order to secure the future of the racetrack hut in the long term, construction work on the track should start this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, which is particularly important for tourism," said Klaus Sühl, transport secretary, on Friday in Erfurt.
He put the cost of repairing the route at around EUR 2.5 million.
The country takes over 75% of this sum.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country, is currently being finalised, declared Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operators already agreed on the technical details.
"The roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for eleven years.
The race shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular train service between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, especially for tourists.
Over the past few months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by a sufficient number of people to order it regularly in the future.
In addition, parts of the route are heavily demolition.
The rise of sex robots is real, and let us worry.
Just when you thought that it could not be even more crazy in 2017, a new report comes out on technological developments in the field of sex robrobots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex-robots are a big thing at the moment.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.
"People make fun of them, but companies make up a lot of them and we will see them even more frequently," said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye color, the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more worrying, because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex puppets have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which give the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible", swarms the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, tied to conversation, or 'in mood'!
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape when one takes a step toward Frigid (here: reluctant) Farrah, worry one the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have a Roxxxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity, they remain on the margins of consumer culture for now.
But what leaks out of the periphery can be very instructive in the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market allows them to do so.
There is a certain overlap between these highly developed sex robots appearing at a time when the rights of women worldwide are under threat, when there is a President in the White House who has irradiated by having sexually assaulted women.
The most deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the twisted bodies and the exposed eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to sum up, when it comes to their 'personalities', robots are not real women.
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply walk away.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or, to put it in the 2017 dictum, maids.
Trump ’ s Great Performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival, newspapers in the US gave advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s elected relatives.
We are all supposedly trying to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noted has Trump ’ s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousine, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, anyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
That is certainly a good thing about the table, but it strikes me in another context that there are also significant risks involved.
Trump has strengthened the left, but his presidency ’ s disfiguring effect has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we talk about 'normalization' and Trump, we refer to the dreadful possibility that one day his patrons will no longer throw us off.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes ” right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reason relative to his standards.
I now find myself struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s funny version of the madman – the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of whom, in fact, look very mild compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the Republicans ’ next candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousine was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crazy and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climatic music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a major roundabout in northern London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strange magical experience, as two two-year olds, one 11-year olds and two women can go there in the 40 ’ s and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is needed.
The poor woman in the department store was apologetic grinning, while I tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius moved breast pain from prison to hospital.
Pistorius left the hospital for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treating cuts to his wrists, which he suffered following a case in his cell, according to the prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine ’ s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his Pretoria house.
Pistorius claimed that he regarded his girlfriend as a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius, who they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to the South African Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg.
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourteenth students were dismissed from Fützen and Epfenhofen for holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the dismissed students will go to secondary school in future, four to primary school.
School leader Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public to the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and director Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken house but is then released.
In addition, the lively crowd performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and caused it to erupt from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken baking, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken broke, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and vanished.
After that, the classes three and four showed a chicken dancing in Yvonne Frank ’ s study.
The hens danced with the young goggles who wore cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
The puppy is different from the other puppy (chicks) but belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His determination was to be free.
She wanted every fourth student to feel accepted in his new school.
My thanks to my colleagues, former head of school, Michael Müller, who keeps jumping in at school bottlenecks, and to the parents.
The chicken age is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
They are very reluctant to release their students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the quartet.
At the end of the course, all the students performed a song of summertime and holiday time.
The children were very happy.
Eight first-class applicants have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece, informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted on television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegally detaining people, including the two Bulgarians, was arrested by the police in Sithonia.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose significant fines on anyone found to be in a place not intended for that purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected now need to know.
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in an overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve exhaust behaviour for cars in emission categories Euro 5 and, in part, Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europa estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have dumb software," says Anja Smetanin.
The German Federal Motor Agency (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and from when are customers informed of updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet set a precise date.
Daimler has announced that it will notify any person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its framework.
How long will the overall changeover take?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
'Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment '.
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises you to wait.
According to Smetanin, foreign producers would probably follow suit.
Is there a risk of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
However, it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
ACE advises you to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award.
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious awards of the Kennedy Center.
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday, this year also saw singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be handed out at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, known for his progressive TV series, had already announced that he would not participate in the gala.
He said to the New York Times: 'This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the resources - and this is a burden on me'.
59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.,, the.,, the, and the.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
Making the City Livable
Roland Wacker, Haslach ’ s city builder, retires next year.
The job is already advertised - however, suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work still gives him great fun, as he conveys in the press interview.
He reports on varied but challenging tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application fulfils the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the earliest possible time.
This means that there is still enough time to get involved, taking into account the regular notice periods.
Since Haslach functions as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the Applicant must have the necessary qualifications.
Because the city wants to retain this function.
If they were no longer able to fill them in, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the city and to the city itself is important, says Wacker, who reports a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, a number of important projects have accumulated, to which Wacker is proud.
"We make the city worth living", he is assured by the construction office and his employees.
In the future, however, diverse projects will also be on the agenda: the reconstruction of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, are underway.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will hit at around EUR 1.5 million, "if we get it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. '
There was a lot of room for a city builder in design.
With Haslach ’ s own farm and gardening, many things can be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot", says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the Old Town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing City Architect stresses.
In any case, the mayor of the city has a high responsibility.
He is a builder, "at the end everything runs over my table".
He can count on longstanding employees in support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (building) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been involved for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the job and stay with it".
Continuity is important not only for a good business climate, but also for the further development of the city.
If you would like to inherit Roland Wacker, the city of Haslach would like to have completed your studies as a diploma engineer or Bachelor of Architecture and have a good knowledge of construction planning and construction law.
The City Building Office is responsible for building and civil engineering, construction planning, land acquisition matters, administration of urban properties, Municipal farm with building yard and city gardening, as well as the suburb building law authority including protection of monuments.
Wheel thrown on lines: South railway closed.
According to the police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators start from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
A rosarote scooter and a bicycle rider had been observed near the scene.
"This goes far beyond a whirlwind," said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch, head of the APA.
The perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and would also have put rail transport at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and plant, as well as the minutes of delay and the cost of rail replacement, the perpetrators could also be the patrons of rail customers.
All in all, the speaker said that a "significant" sum should be assumed.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, and rail transport on the southern railway line could be carried out without any obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains had disappeared on Friday morning, two of which were long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch, overhead lines had to be exchanged for about 200 metres.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease).
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable state, which affects about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach swamps and blisters, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, inflammatory intestinal disease may result.
Experiments have found that some kind of toleration-promoting immunodeficiency occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their originals.
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger cell appearance.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells ".
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestines, if the same system also works in humans.
The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of mammals had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with mice ’ s intestinal problems – the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice ’ s dams were sequenced to DNA, and six types of bacteria were found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them the mice lacked.
mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal robiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grew in a fluid and then transferred small quantities of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells became the tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol 3 milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice ’ s feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50%, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as they do in mice, but deficiencies in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the intestinal surface.
Possibly high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a genius with Nemanja Matic.
Manchester United signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, believing Jose Mourinho after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40 million signature by Chelsea began with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the role of holder when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues ’ Preparatory Asian tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
'We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later. '
Besides Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a 'fantastic job' to meet three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for which I thank the association," he added.
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have taken a lot of trouble. '
Boeing "Malt" Dreamliner in Heaven
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots departed from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan and took the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.
New setback for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem.
As the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just not a flare from the party headquarters, just no headwinds from the federal government - that was the main wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, Willy-Brandt staff have watched events in SPD-governed capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds.
They were setbacks.
One by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red Green simply cannot govern reliably," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network (RND).
The surprising departure of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s government into a serious crisis.
Five months before the general election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition.
The Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kellner has asked the breakaway Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
Transitioning to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate ’ s will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate, "said the Federal Managing Director and campaign manager of the Greens to the German editorial network (RND).
"This must not be true," a SPD campaigner sighs when the new hio message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands without a government majority after the Green deputy Elke Twesten surrendered to the CDU.
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national federations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the comrades reassured themselves at the time.
After the regional elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That became the case - and things got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to a halt, and the Düsseldorf bust flattened the party.
The comrades were slow to pick up again in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit in Hamburg came.
And with him came the next blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nickname that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because, in crisis communication, he subsequently made pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust emissions affair and its role on the supervisory board of the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, criticism has been going on for some time.
Miese survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying to place emphasis on the federal government in recent weeks.
The effort of the former mayor of Hannover to increase his power in Berlin was not concealed by comrades around Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted because they promised Weil to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because, in fact, there is no blame for the partisan dispute between the Greens from Lower Saxony.
And Schulz certainly does not.
For the time being, therefore, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Your anger is directed at the Greens, and especially at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Mrs Twesten puts her own careers above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, leader of the party left in the SPD Bundestag Group, the German editorial network (RND).
Mrs Twsten has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but has been elected to parliament via the national list of the Greens from Lower Saxony, according to the Member from Lower Saxony.
The logical consequence would be for it to return its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag Group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre."
"Four years ago, the will of voters was clear: the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now the personal career memory of a future CDU deputy falsifies the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Funding for Locality III
If you want to renovate your old house, you can get help from the country in the near future.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60%.
For Schindler, the refurbishment to date is a "success project" - it is important to promote internal development as well, and not just to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Karlsruhe Government Bureau informed that there would be a rehabilitation area III.
The amount of funding was EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country and the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a rehabilitation area come into being?
They will, according to Schindler, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, there is also a role to be played by whether there is any interest in the planned area to be remedied.
If necessary, the territorial borders could then be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme "Social City", within the framework of which the rehabilitation would then be carried out.
The programme focuses on the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out objectively, that is to say, per piece of land.
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the eligibility period for the funds has run until 30 April 2026.
However, by September this year, the inventory would first be carried out, in which those involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire for completion.
In November or December, as far as possible, the decision on the statute is to be taken so that the rehabilitation can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing urban problems and deciding when to redevelop and to what extent.
There will also be a change in the land registry for the land.
Pietzschmann himself would come to reception again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Arc of Buildings and Plots", which deals, among other things, with the building condition and the restoration plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Household and Household Arc", information about the size, distribution and inhabitants of a residential area can be provided.
The blue "sheet" can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.,,,,,,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Moreover, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "greyhound principle" - who arrives first, grills first.
It is not possible to 'reserve' funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" have been shown to make a restoration "tasteful" for those present.
British inventor is setting up a microchip to get into the house and into the car with a hand. is.
A British inventor is the first in the country to have a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office, and even start his car by hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between fingers and fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam ’ s firm also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an extra £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built in both his home and his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House ’ s Advertising Cost to the taxpayer Thous
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that emphasizes American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military ’ s data given to TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exhibited next to a Maine yacht, Wisconsin fire brigade and Mississippi forklift truck.
The White House Military Office demanded the helicopter ’ s presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his supervisor, Deputy Naval Command for Aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn at 3 p.m. on 17 July at 7 a.m. until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.
The note adds that if departures from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the restrictions on service hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit ’ s security staff remained at the aircraft during the time on the ground.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could break the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Sounds as if you are closed," replied the deputy commander.
The "Made in America" event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave impetus to the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump carried out an investigation in February, when the presidential aircraft performed taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of complaints about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled by the show" Made In America "- which shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers using American materials," said Deputy White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to deliver accurate centimetres to the US President in the White House.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said one official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours this day for 'non-presidential support missions'.
The White House said that taxpayers did not assume the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have budget drawings for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly tariffs by the US Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD refund rate for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Recordings of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for refunds is highly misleading," said Walters.
'These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget. '
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance, and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House press officer, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasise this. '
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his South Lawn tour for the event, but he was in the driver ’ s seat of a fire-fighting car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
'I know Sikorsky very well ', the President said,' I have three of them '.
TC BW Neuss ’ s Tricky Task
Top runner of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga starts at the table third Suchsdorf SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will appear tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games, the top runner of the second tennis league has retained a sense of reality.
In any case, team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar format.
I think the team is very good at the rear. '
For the quality and stability of the SV team, the imports from the far north are the most important.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to Davis Cup stakes.
And they are also strong in double, "says Zay looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"As always, this will be difficult for us.
You also need good luck there. '
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north is practical.
His blue-white debut could give Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman who is currently active at the Challenger Tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga event, the Czech player Zdenek Kolar will play at the tournament in the Czech Liberec.
The hitherto unwon Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with Belarus Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
However, he should be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was the number one junior world ranking in January 2016, someone from Marius Zay's trainer club will fill up the cadre.
How America Can Bad OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed Wednesday evening ’ s bill to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his haste to enact the law," Congress packaged a few "unconstitutional regulations," he appreciated.
The reaction from Moscow was as strong as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US move.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors from the domestic OMV, together with other European companies, have been concerned about the construction of the Nord Stream 2 Russian Baltic Sea pipeline.
The backdrop of threats is enormous.
Nevertheless, the oil company's official statement states that it is too early to assess the impact.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
"The press" looked at which the Group could defend itself and which could really hurt it.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be focussed on Netflix's hit series.
Despite the second season of Narcos, unveiling Pablo Escobars Killer, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The three and four seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, DEA has focused its attention on the world ’ s richest drug trafficking organization: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful sponsors, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Role backwards: The City is deploying 46 kitchen aids.
The city organizes the Kita lunch dinner itself again.
With permanent contact persons for the children and assignment to the team.
In the city nurseries, the clock is turned back.
As of September 1, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the city's daycare facilities (Kitas).
This is good news for Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the Youth Aid department: 'We have all been very pleased'.
Cooking is still carried out outside the house: a caterer takes on this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 daycare centers in Krefeld area, and 44 children receive a warm meal at midday.
Last year, there were 2800 children sitting at the tables and demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week eat lunch in the Kita," explains Pommeranz.
'The offer shall also apply in the 35-hour service if children stay until 2 p.m. '.
As of 1 September, 46 part-time employees will have kitchen services: they will warm up the food supplied, add salad, raw food and fruit, carry out the meal individually, give out the food, leave, wash and clean the kitchen.
"Employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven group units - determines the amount of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"Thus they are much more integrated and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the kite steering".
It is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
'Children should help prepare food '.
The direct connection of kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for children.
"They have a known force in the kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - up to now also the job of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only improved the quality of the kitchen service but also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in comparing costs for the city's own administration and foreign procurement, according to the press office.
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours do not count as much as 750 people in education," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN.
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, President-in-Office of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will stand in provincial elections, with three women standing for the role of Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters being women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will peacefully transfer power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan ’ s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered from 3.6 million registered voters.

Men Attempt to Auct 13-year-old Girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men approached the 13-year-olds who were on Kolping Street with friends at around 14.55 because they wanted to phone the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but failed.
The duo fled without loot.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is under way.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to reassure Bishop McVitie managers of the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had kept quiet about the future of investments at Tollcross.
More than 500 employees work in the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, said he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be 'the first to know' if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's head of branch, GMB Scotland McVitie's called on 'to express concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being promoted'.
GMB-senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about Tollcross's business needs and investment plans for the future deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
As a result, from the perspective of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs, and a chronic decline in output, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving McVitie production presence. "
A spokeswoman from Pladis said: 'The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will react directly to it, as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with Tollcross staff and GMB representatives at which some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: 'In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise Tollcross's heritage as a production site and, if our operations at the site change, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know. '
Has the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago of Neymar?
The League ’ s side may regret its interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not slacken in her prosecution of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the World Recoattack?
The sensational approach fueled the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous record, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional player in the world.
Barcelona is angry at the way that Neymar forced his way out, though a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to look after him since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But was the World Cup president warned of this prospect three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to have one of the best players signed by PSG.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players signed with you, it will have consequences. '
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers to Neymar.
Rollers Reversed and Corrected
During the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately reversed a scooter placed in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the estate number 30, causing material damage of more than 200 euros on the car's cover.
The police force Schramberg, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, asks for instructions.
In 2373, the USS Enterprise-D was assigned to the USS Enterprise-D.
Because a car met him on his track, the driver had to avoid a VW tour and touched the railroad.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum and his VW were on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.
In the area surrounding Stolzenau, he met a car on his track, so he had to turn to the right.
The tour driver touched the plank.
The car caused material damage.
The driver of the passenger car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes-Benz driver had not noticed the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the 'polluter pays' driver to contact the Commission in Stolzenau on phone 05761 / 92060.
Interview: 'Domspatzen Report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger'
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuses relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what the author and historian Michael Hesemann says.,,,.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen continues to provide for discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church", explained to the German press agency after publication, that he expects an apology from the former bishop of Regensburg and today's cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly benefit the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their misappraisal of what happened at the time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the fact that "double standards" were applied to the reporting of violence in the cathedral lanes.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation", according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "You are happy to go to the church and this is a found fresco".
She also pointed out that in her youth, 'beatings were a normal pedagogical means' to deal with naughty children like me '.
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of abuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Quite wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial book "Mein Bruder der Papst" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Bishop of Regensburg?
Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral treasures were sexually abused with high plausibility, and 67 Cathedral treasures were sexually abused.
In the final report it says about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be said that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence were used by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment could be more severe for students.
Despite this, unlike many others, it is striking that many victims value the general humanity of R. R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence. "
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral pilgrimages Georg Ratzinger relieves in his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440 page report on the "incidents of violence against protective orders at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen" gives a contradictory picture of the master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became handy when a cathedral treasure did not produce top performance musically.
How do you view this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it.
Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence processes at preschool were also taking place outside its sphere of effect.
He can be accused of being too late or of not taking initial suggestions seriously enough.
The domain grammar school on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, give an excellent testimony, describing him as "warmhearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "sympathetic", an extremely benevolent teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonuses and was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has led to outrage.
He himself admitted years ago that he was deeply saddened and apologized for not only sticking with stools and throwing the key bund on the floor, but also dragging the ears of distributed and all too naughty guys.
To save his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, in the 1960s and 1970s, among parents and teachers alike.
Do you also know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think all of us who were born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the pre-school violence processes, these are, of course, trivial.
One wonders if it is not more to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him.
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.
The truth, however, is that the report relieves Mr Ratzinger from all aspects!
In connection with the report, a great deal has been reported in the media on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedral Columns.
Will Georg Ratzinger, in the final report, also be accused of any involvement or compassion with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the master of the cathedral.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I have never dared to talk to my father or my mother about this," said one of the people concerned, on behalf of the others, "It was very embarrassing to me".
The real problem in educating about sexual abuse was, and is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, it would certainly not be a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.
How do the Domspatzen-students rate Ratzinger ’ s role in cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: As one interviewed pupil put it: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which it was he (Georg Ratzinger) who could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I also think it is really absurd to assume that it is he who... has opened his hands more forcefully or clearly, or even more so, than to their parents, boarding school leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. '
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion: 'The fact that pupils and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation'.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, therefore, Georg Ratzinger is free from any form of cognition.
Nor can he be accused of not obstructing or bringing him to justice.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these odious crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
The media read a lot of "violent processes" at the Regensburg Cathedral Columns.
The former master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything has been mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence processes and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is another abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation between the preschool school and the secondary school of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents dating back to 1945, that is, also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir conductor of the Cathedral's spheres.
All the terrible caning pedagogy, the cases in which boys from sadistic teachers were actually harassed and maltreated and suffered horribly, all took place on the preschool school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys on his face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On this, as most witnesses stress, the topic of pre-school was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that 'many victims value the general humanity of R. R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence'.
At most, the accusation remains of having looked away.
Despite all the efforts, however, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported on the pre-school conditions.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and did not want to hear about the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (according to the witness), and then again around 1993.
Georg Ratzinger consistently closed his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it he points out to them that 'caning is still practised in preschool'.
Even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity when caning sentences had long been banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the people affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the permitted limit had actually been exceeded.
Nor can we say that he has always looked away.
That is simply not true.
It was only in 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to the times.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "trap of anachronism", that is, the danger of judging past by today's moral standards.
The prince is right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which was odious at all times, or to what was buried in the pre-school school of conflict and violence on innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was then common.
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being addressed.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is to say, slapping the ears and hairs, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also adhered strictly to it.
What image of his time in Regensburg was given by Georg Ratzinger in the conversations with you for the book "Mein Bruder der Papst"?
Did the issue of caning also arise?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his point of view, because the domes played only a side role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there.
However, this must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world renown from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburg Cathedral spatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and bonbons alone, you do not turn recalcitrant boys into great singers and face every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-reliance.
What kind of person did you experience in the conversations with Georg Ratzinger about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I have really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have seen him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, good-natured, deeply believing and heartfelt person, and one cannot imagine that he could do anything for a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former domes still keep in contact with him today, 23 years after his departure, visit him, read him out - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
So those who still do not forgive him that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the domes are grateful to him today for having enriched their lives and brought the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good father - a strict father, of course, that may be his father - but he was also a kind respected figure, to whom they are still looking up today and who they almost revere.
I would like to make it quite clear once again that all the accusations against him are methods of education that were the order of the day at the time.
We can be pleased that we have long since overcome this period.
But it is highly unfair to turn a man into a media scapegoat simply because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind this is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves it.
Now the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit and without whom no one would know the Regensburg Cathedral spheres outside Bavaria, and perhaps even Germany, should finally be in peace.
