Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city.
A deceptive talt where young people are supposed to meet today.
A pit chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being excavated.
Smaller farmers cultivate the former land.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It nerves if maps are not current.
Everyone who had to get worked up because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer by the Geoportals of the State Government of Bavaria, are anything but up-to-date - but that is precisely why they are very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century in the crime area of the Mercury in Munich.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be seen as such.
In the large overview map, more detailed maps were drawn up for cities and municipalities, so-called ballot papers.
These were created according to the Bayerischer Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and correspond to the first survey of Bayerns. were and.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted to have an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew from Lunéville with the peace of 9 February 1801, today ’ s neighbors were the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographische Bureau" (Topographical Bureau) and thus the Bavarian surve.
The Munich Urpositionsblatt dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.
The comparison between the former and the present is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has spread in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.
Sendling was introduced 21 years after the creation of the map, 1877, as a Munich district.
Today Untersendling is located in the heart of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the Plinganserstrasse, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the western park is today, you see nothing as fields - at first glance: a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears when zooming in: handwriting numbered pieces from the so-called "Uraufnahme", from which the land tax was derived.
Today, small plots no longer occupy farmers there, but rather small gardeners of the "Land in Sonne" plant.
A large green area is situated north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar there is the historical map an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or the heights "at the lies" but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße people were once locked up with madness.
In 1858 / 59 the Munich County Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was created. were, and.
In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who was associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the purchase of the so-called delusions.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has occupied himself with the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients, first place had been, later was extended to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular mist in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatry in Germany, is located there.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich-Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training enterprises.
Westlich lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the "Casa Don Bosco" children's house was erected, modelled on the origins of the deception that had been destroyed in World War II in bombings.
The Marienplatz was named "Haupt Platz" in 1856. The Kaufinger street was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought the Second World War to the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs in December 1944 demolished many holes in the city centre.
A large one remained until today - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small businesses, and a medieval chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the funeral for the second S-Bahn (city rail) line were.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil rights group published travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel by the State and to exercise extreme caution, as a series of questionable race-based incidents have occurred recently throughout the state and are noted here," says the group's opinion.
A recent law by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination actions, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state aimed at disproportionate minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances early in the year, after he had no gasoline during the trip by the state and was detained by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime.
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri, which shows that black drivers in the state will hold 75% more frequently than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared to bring bail or let the relatives know that they travel through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s Hassverbrechen report program, which classify the state in terms of the number of such violations to the country ’ s 16th rank.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Before that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for having migrated, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently pressure groups have used the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary.
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun-Projekt is a success project and will be continued next year.
The members of the CDU, Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac, obtained a picture on the spot.
On the occasion of the rights grabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverbands met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members. of, the of., the of,,, the of...
Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his company, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, cooled 40 dairy cows and also supplied many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests.
"Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaunprojekt as "elementary important".
I cannot make profitable economies on such steep land.
The green space for a lot of work, a lot of work has to be done with the Motorsense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography", Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003 he took over the parental business and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a bio plant.
For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The Commune recognized the importance of the Weidezaunprojekt and is glad about the promotion of Leader".
Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of EUR 3 000 to 4 000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of land could be extended for a long time to come.
"The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and worry about how to continue their business," stressed the mayor.
Farmers are often criticised for promoting it.
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were fenced in for.
The open area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be raised until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of €71 500, half was funded by Leader, a district that contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, farmers love EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of meadows.
"The big advantage is the longevity of fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a good job without farmers and rural women does not work".
Even for Peter Weiß, it was clear: "Here we produce the best food".
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie (LPR) Baden-Württemberg facilitates the state promotion of fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
Prerequisite is the existence of a support framework defined by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be draconian (35% gradient) and must therefore be threatened with reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build the 16 km fence, is currently under way.
The conservation area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now Trump ’ s White House is embracing the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans, like everyone else, therefore appreciate Saddam Hussein's carefully staged overthrow in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically curtail legal immigration with a sense of freedom.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty-beekeepers would have borrowed him if he had done so.
But he grasped their meaning, and especially the meaning attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base.
As Miller Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the statue of liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem to which you refer was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is factually correct, but, as he put it himself, this is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your mills, your poor, / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the elk waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "elating waste" on our screens was better to see.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US.
This conflict, because of the importance of statue, is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance.
Lazarus - and her friends who advocated placing their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they were performing a highly political act.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic visual representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.
The combination of poem and image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this a long time ago.
The great cries of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives who brought America ’ s flame into the post-World: “Lady Liberty is moving forward. ”
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not pave the way to the United States. '
Ziemlich ungewöhnlich ist Limbaugh hier auf etwas gestoßen.
The importance of statue is quite a question of the position of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, elving but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the will they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish team members of Britain
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the British team.
The performance director of the UK Light athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team in the World Cup cadre.
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the United Kingdom's athletics have to learn from it.
"We welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it," said Black.
"I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are Medaillen-Anwärter, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Your captain's speech was incredibly ', says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great. "
The Commonwealth silver medal winners, who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 m hurdles, say that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland ’ s best total athlete so far at the World Cup was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The midrange runner, Muir, is heading in this direction and last year set five British and two European records.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch the victory of the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games after a great season.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot in Team Lee McConnell was.
The team chapter says that it is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots belong not only to the team, but in some cases also to the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team chapter is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums.
As regards my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy with this situation, as we have a home world championship.
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are once again in the Olympic.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be so easy to be a great atmosphere out there. '
Blocking critics of Facebook: Don ’ t be bothered by a public office if you can ’ t stand in the way of electorates.
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He shifted criticism, certainly.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said: 'Freedom of speech can be removed - and, stupid and stupid, we will be led like sheep to slaughter'.
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted those who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him earlier this week.
The staff of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online commentary was full of a backlash with "Na, and?".
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it is important.
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hit head.
He has shown firm leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and play on his hapless head for chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum officially designated and paid by staff who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan ’ s spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the actions of the governor, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online the whip.
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserfüllt, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news program "The Post".
"I do not like this idea, either, when a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are disregarded by some more than a so-called collective effort, and not recognised as a large group.,,,,,,,,,,,,
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" would probably call "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if the same thing had been done, that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or arrest or silence protesters.
But that is precisely what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when she appointed a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter-writers suggested his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that overwhelmed his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade, and shipping with Britain, according to the historical documents collected by the Washington Project ’ s Online Papers.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse form the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Ireland, which last year led to the final round of the Archerfield Links, before losing against Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance-Club was built, and we see how he reached with this event his fame," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He is a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. '
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending himself for the first time as a champion, even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said the player based in Southport.
"I could not defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate. '
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action at home.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I am glad that this has been done. '
With the trio in the field, former Masters Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James, and Mark McNulty are the winners.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance belong to the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free, parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
This results from a study conducted by the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
In comparison, he used his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new research is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Housing connections turn out to be very complex
The construction works in the Villinger street are in full swing and "are somewhat in time", says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of domestic connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as there is a lot of hidden in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which is constantly hampering construction work, is a major problem for Stumpp.
"The ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and barrier bars is already enormous", Heinze reports.
The road is closed and only the scheduled buses are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were pretty exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks the dinner she does not use a cook.
It rarely uses a pot.
In its wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually lays a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the cartilever is washed with ice, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, for example washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was admitted to Indonesia after a controversial referendum in 1969, when only 1,026 elders were supposed to vote by a public handpicked before the occupying forces.
An existing movement that stirred up independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against Jakarta ’ s government, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated roofs transformed by rust into various yellow brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, revered Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We were not accustomed to wearing these clothes," says Degei and hints at her lively, hand-woven Turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst rates of infant mortality and literacy in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a high-land province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport lost $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has natural resources worth an estimated USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua people who ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are relentlessly treated.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua ’ s tribal country in the 1970 ’ s became genocide under the Asia-Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything," says a 2016 report by Erzdiözese Brisbane, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua ’ s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warnings sell fried chicken and gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"The migrants have begun selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to work.
"It has cost the native Papua - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi in the popular community, promised to address the inequalities and legal injuries in Papua during his campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October, Paniai had a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The shocked children told them that they should turn their spotlights on.
One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk, chased and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They brought together ceremonial hunting gowns and conducted the Waita dance - in a circle constantly and a bird song imitating - by Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm.
Some protesters began to throw stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldier was sent a command via an internal spark: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," it is said in an official document of TIME that was not released the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for rest and demanded the crowd to return home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful old wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was" said Yohanes, who as many Indonesians only bears a name, the TIME in dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I bought him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It is about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings came only the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the victims ’ families, and vowing to address Papua ’ s historical grievances.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements, but there are processes that need to be enforced, "he said.
Then, Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June, saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, 'everything is regulated by law', he said.
Wiranto, accused of "crimes against humanity," which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim infidelity.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," says Yohanes.
"I am tired."
He says that he still lives in fear years later.
"I am afraid," he says.
"I am afraid to be arrested by the military, I am afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I had buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniais neighbourhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital, a person and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man who was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw drowned when he fished in a nearby river died on his way to hospital.
Local villagers protested at the company ’ s location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the crowd and killed one.
"We were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, so the TIME.
"I hid myself two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the police mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal living in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, on the pretext of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua is Paniai known as "a tragic, forgotten place.
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as much out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat, especially Nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women, who can work on the four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants who have arrived since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport have increased.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own companies competitive.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because here there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chair of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on media coverage remain strained.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Asia ’ s deputy director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia's most troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesia ’ s government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the 'various and widespread violations' in Papua, including the Paniai Shoulder.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
The Speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta: 'Indonesia still has a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases'.
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited on 4 May, local people took their silence and pressured him 'We want freedom', according to a source that also attended the meeting, but would remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai conclusions," says Gobai, the chair of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their vote for Jokowi as a "guilt" he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, the Paniai victims' families carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the corpse of a victim was buried on an area just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a shaken head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'Torch' skyscraper from Dubai for the second time
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai its diary and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meters high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in only two years, which one accidentally calls the Torch Tower (torch tower tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and when people were shouting.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor down, "a resident who told his name as George angab, Reuters.
Dubais civil protection authorities said that the units of firefighting against 4.00 local time (00.00 clock GMT) extinguished the fire and cool the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the fairing, exterior clothing for decoration or insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said they believe that the system of insulation and disguise panels on the London Grenfeld Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has passed his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
This is often very long, but it is precisely for this reason that very esteemed five-part classics remain in the traditional competition.
63.54% of member countries voted for the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was scarcely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our membership did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic contests, "said Haggerty.
We will continue to work to improve the assessment.
Gar did not come to the vote until after many inconsistencies the proposal was made to carry the final out in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: for example, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the coming year ’ s first round.
In order to reduce organizers' costs, training requirements will be made easier and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers brings prohibited items to the plane, finds a survey out.
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously banned items were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent of the aircraft, while accidentally banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1% claimed that they had discovered that they were mistaken for firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey conducted by a Jet-Charterservice, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc, found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had knowingly tried to fly with something banned by TSA, 19.7% were millennials, compared to less than 15% who were members of the X generation.
The most common items collected on TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% said that they knowingly carried items with blades through the security check, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately taken banned drugs to the plane.
The company said it had consulted travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods would have been brought through airport security and how many would have done it deliberately.
It is no surprise that the people who bear the most jewellery - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of items confiscated by TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to give with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
In doing so, he has so far failed to propose that part of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla ’ s head Elon Musk for the first time in announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet has a different, less glossy figure: the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
Over the past few months, Musk has often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, which is about to be delivered.
Now, Musk admits: Of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (US $1000 and UK £1000) "full refund".
Currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, Tesla ’ s leader does not believe that the cancellation of around 12% of all orders to date could be the problem.
His argument: the challenge in ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models are to be taken together - 500,000, 2020 one million.
Demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
After all, the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from going off in droves.
EPA ’ s head, Pruitt, is withdrawing from the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions, owing to the reluctance of the Obama-Era rules.
A day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency ’ s chief, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state ’ s environmental authorities than previous.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous post in a federal court.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who had been President Donald Trump ’ s attorney at Oklahoma long ago, was a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulation that chemical industry and fossil-fuel industries oppose.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority by trying to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitoring and reducing methane leaks.
Pruitt proposed, in a statement issued on Wednesday evening, that his U-turn in ozone standards was simply the EPO ’ s willingness to work with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," Pruitt said, who left EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in legal regulation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that it gives us seriously. '
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion that Pruitt will at some point use its' competence to delay and all other legally available powers' to ensure that the rules' are based on sound policies and the best available information '.
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPO this week, said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPO - after our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and those over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources respond to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and every year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for air protection that we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump administration to pollute itself and its particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church.
750 years St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16th at 4.30 pm is invited to a serenade.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius complex a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made friends and supporters of Tumling their concern.
Walter Martini stresses: "It is a unique village jewel".
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergisches Urkundenbuch in documents: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen, including the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the text of the document, there was also a ruling court on the Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, to which the church or patronage law belonged and not the other way round.
So people lived there as well.
As can be seen from the description of Oberamtes Freudenstadt in 1858, besides the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which can still be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the ruling settlers of the village.
Old maps from the time around the year 1600 underpin these historical facts.
The patronage law originated from the early medieval church law.
A Lord who built a church, furnished and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church, and also inherited this church of his own.
This was linked to the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The size of the two crumbs at Christmas 1673.
The newly opened bell was first crowned in 1692, but had to be delivered later in World War II in 1942.
In the Thirty Years War (1616 to 1648) the windows were insulated and the bells were stolen.
The roof was leaky.
In 1796, French troops moved near the church.
They broke the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to topple in 1809.
Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of St. Hilari was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In the New Year ’ s Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to avoid an accident, the tower was broken.
Only the Turmzwerg, which still exists today, was preserved as a witness to the 750 year old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the "Schaffigen Rentnern" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius facility.
As organiser, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen are invited to the 6th Serenade at the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, 16 July.
This is made by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The final word is the preacher Hartmut Romann.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Decree is available from 3.30 p.m.
To the end of the Serenade there is a reconstruction in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer night under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers challenge the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumling feel particularly committed to home care, as confirmed by Serenade organiser Walter Martini.
Association wants to have windmills approved
"Boisheim defends itself" does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore approached the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" invited Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It is illegal.
The association argues that, at the time the approval was issued on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Nette Boisheimer, because at the time in Viersen, only one wind turbine zone existed on the city ’ s frontier with Schwalm Valley.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone prevents the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
These zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being "conquered".
Although the city of Viersen had decided a few days earlier to change the land use plan to a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of a planning requirement, the issued approval document remains unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim wehrt sich".
Current state of affairs: The city council decided to re-open the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This excludes the granting of permission for the construction of wind turbines from planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The appropriate letters have been received by the district quarter since last week," said a speaker.
The circle takes it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to stop the procedure.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to speak in substance about the reasoning of the association "Boisheim defends itself".
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200 metre high wind turbines on an area near the Nette Boisheimer.
Already last year, the company in which the city was involved in Viersen is closed leasing contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of large grounds.
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - roughly one-fifth of all four seniors' electricity needs.
The NEW Re wants to invest some EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersens Stadtrat gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Windpark Linnich near Aachen, as well as for the participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crashes together: Mrs dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were easily injured.
The road remained locked for hours.
According to police records, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her car accompanied her 53-year-old mother as a companion accompanied the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and traders are planning "home shoots" weekend weekend
Bad Langensalzaer und Menschen aus der Region sollen im September die Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Innenstadt neu entdecken.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on the 8th and 9th of September to entice the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade union, Christian König, announced, the "home shoots" weekend should raise customers' awareness of what offers the city itself has prepared apart from the usual supermarket goods.
It is therefore a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
Furthermore, domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite you to the "Mitternacht shopping area".
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the region.
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, so Christian König.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The trade association and the city are thus entering another stage of the ‘ Attractive City ’ project.
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the Brunnenfest samt selling Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be reopened or re-opened.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalising the city centre - right up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was said with a network to overcome the lethargy that had spread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, director of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, said that for the first time five Thuringian cities are taking part in the nation-wide third "home shoots" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should 'promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities', so strike.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her own direct environment with his / her buying behaviour.
Two deaths and several injuries after explosion at the US school
During construction, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New people have been injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine more have been injured, some of them seriously.
According to the fire brigade, an injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
A person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A missing person was also born later.
The dead were employees of the school.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday there were few people in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump, after leaked transcripts of telephone calls to Mexico, pressured the border wall ’ s payment.
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump, in a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, asked to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall and reportedly said to him: 'You cannot say that to the press'.
Trump started his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the US southern border, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US would "ridicule" refugees who emigrated to Australia, "be bad" and "stupid", and that the existence of trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a "depp" after proposing a ban on resettlement of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after having told Mr Turnbull, "that is the unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Massacre: Activists cite racist Lynchakt as a call for justice again.
A Ford Mercury in 1948 drove through a group of rural viewers, Monroe, Georgia, and rested on the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men emerged with rifles to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe - took a long train on his cigar and watched through the windscreen.
Drinks floated into fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" rode the man.
"Get it out of the car!"
Shrine torn the silence when a young black man was torn apart by the front-passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just an offsetting.
But if a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all of the audience outraged very real sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been accused of murder.
"It is really inconceivable that in all these years no one has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in organizing posterity.
"It is a jewelry on a story, but it is a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a life long civil rights activist.
For him, offsetting serves as a dramatic call for action, and is an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must get justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A court doctor puts a begging towel over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore ord-Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received from the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a ruling by the Supreme Court allowed the citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
About at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black Farmpächter Roger Malcom stacked a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a struggle, allegedly for a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent White landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they came from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes here a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks worded it even more succinctly.
"It was an election rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, then this will happen to you here. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual submission of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, touching, and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It is hard to see, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We do not want to talk about the Lynchen because then we will be confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've done".
The samples for this year's production started in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest black - moved into a room and laughed when Greene played a well-rehearsed overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is the co-director of Greenes.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I am not so," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, the Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester tried to play their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who rides the cushion and afflicts him, furious that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said n --- he, disappearing from my property!"
Rascona reciprocates fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
It is alarming and confused.
Was I too tough?
"No," Greene said, still kicking.
"I simply do not believe that white people said then 'n --- he'.
"But," one of the other black actors zelte.
"You only have to hit the hard 'R.'.
And this is exactly where the energy shifts in the room, a feeling of comradeship replaces the unease.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharp and emphatically.
Nobody is laughing.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There is cry, shots and then silence.

"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work, director Frank Castorf also sets the scene for a colorful, frivolous staging in front of gigantic, six-sounding scenes.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner, including Mauerrest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "plastic and elastic" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.

Katharina Wagner will have fun with it.
"It is noted that the audience grew up with the" ring "in a way," she briefly said before the performance of dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it was also an understanding of his view grew.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their voluntary year.
Where anywhere?
Menge: Normalerweise in Steinfurt in der Möbelbörse, einmal in der Woche helfe ich hier in Greven in der Möbelbrücke aus.
I also worked at school during the open day.
What are your experiences with this?
Number: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, in other words a late professional volunteer.
How is that?
Menge: Ich habe Abitur gemacht.
And then a civil engineering study, let us say, successfully aborted.
I realized that for me it is the wrong thing and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked myself what you did.
Make a social year, there is a glimpse, there you can see how there is on the spot, in the focal point maybe also, really is.
And was it?
A lot: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social field in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably at the Youth Welfare Office Herne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Is it not unusual to have several different sites during the voluntary service?
Number: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from the old age home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the UCITS, in other words in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing to do.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Number: Well, this is not about calculating statics.
There are always other people who have a completely different history behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a young person, has been taken out of the family - one must always respond individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of contact?
Number: For this I am not the type.
It is an area that gives a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also sometimes negative moments, but so is life just.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revitalize business.
The British educational group Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72%, because another restructuring program would be launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company.
The job cuts that Director-General John Fallon announced mostly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost-cutting program a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) to revive a business that has been hit by the fast move to digital learning.
The company, which last month sold its stake in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann, said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after achieving an increase of 1% to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Konvoi attack by Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack.
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killed a Nato soldier and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement was made by NATO.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the Qarabagh district in the event of an incident.
The bombing is the last act of violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a statement by Nato, it is said that the explosion took place on Thursday evening, when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an 'improvised vocabulary of persons'.
The statement says that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, some 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people, with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack, since US troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, with US President Donald Trump weighing up the number of US troops supporting, increasing, military and police forces in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
EPA reverses decision to delay the Smog rule after lawsuit
The US Environmental Protection Agency has revoked a decision to delay the Obama administration ’ s regulation that states are obliged to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the Agency for the move.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to press ahead with the so-called 'Ozone provisions 2015' and said that it indicated the Agency's commitment to work with states.
"We believe in dialogue and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPO ’ s intention to set the ozone regulations – which would measure emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards – to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to roll back a wide range of environmental concerns that former President Barack Obama has imposed, as part of a broader agenda that Trump claims to spur economic growth.
But efforts have triggered the Democrats ’ and nature groups ’ setback, which worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The website of the EPO says that breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase breathing symptoms" such as asthma.
Community space
At the end of the day, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a Community area in the future senior citizens' residence.
Before the discussion, there is an important piece of information: The purchase contract for the missing property was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
It is true that it will take some time before the area belonging to the church community is in the municipal district, but there is now no planning barrier to the project to be started by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace of 70 square metres for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council prefer not to see such a common space as a meeting place only for residents of the senior-just residence, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "knitting café" made the round.
The decision taken last autumn to allocate funds to the current budget will be based on support.
Construction is in the rehabilitation area.
The creation of a Community area would be, according to Tjaden, eligible for 60% of 30%.
The proposal for a decision provides for a signal to be sent to the investor that, in this respect, he does not want to throw a stick between the two, stating that both satellite - which is leaned to the environment - and the Pultdach - which reduces the grape level and makes the construction of economic power possible.
Needless to say, not only does Wilfried Sohmer think this addition is necessary.
If 's help: unanimous he happens the body.
It is not as easy as the Community area.
Daniela reputations point to the many buildings with which we are not making such progress, for which we are now rejecting the Community area from the window, she says: 'I am struggling with this'.
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area, but absolutely against local participation.
It sees a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant, but rather gives a real countervalue, marketable in case of doubt, is the counter-argument.
Staigers request that the proposal for a decision be split up accordingly, there are three advocates.
For example, there are two votes against the original programme that Stefan Haller sums up in this way: 'If we take the decision in this way, we are taking a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure'.
Collision with car: Radler is thrown on street.
On the road crossing, a 82-year-old cyclist was captured in Garath by a car on Wednesday and was seriously injured.
As the police told us, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on the bike at 12.20 p.m. on the road Schwarzer Weg from direction Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the cableway at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A priority granted to him in the same direction as a driver travelling by car.
When the Langenfelder took to the streets, however, he did not seem to care about the traffic.
He joined a car that steered a 66-year-old woman.
The man was thrown onto the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue failure.
FC Bayern München has to give up the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund on David Alaba and Thiago.
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to leave the game to Dortmund.
With Personalsorgen the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the trophy winner.
On Saturday (8.30 pm / ZDF and Eurosport), the German football record champion Bayern Munich will be making ever greater attendance at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
The coach Carlo Ancelotti has to do without David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Münchnern Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six test games Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti and added: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
The last one was not good. '
The 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance during the first official mandatory season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intense game ".
The duel of the two German soccer weights pulls the fans into their bans.
The match is sold out with 81.360 spectators, divided the German Football League (DFL) on Friday.
Hiking from Star to Star
In Harz, the first "Star Path" is to be created nationwide.
This is the plan of the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star-path" meets the information needs of many visitors to Harzbesucher.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up the planned route table and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase up to 2018, the association plans "well-attainable installations at five to six locations" in Oberharz.
Infra-cold St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the table should be supplemented by Internet.
This is why the location selection of a good mobile network reception has a role to play.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Path train is to be extended by train.
"On the Star Path, the observer can learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors, or why a star shines more strongly than another, even though it is much further away.
It will also be communicated in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see it.
The association has been operating the highest situated observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the heart of the National Park Harz is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are visible from there with the naked eye.
In the Uni-Stadt region, there has been something similar since 2003 on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen, as well as the planned Sternenwerg - the Planetenweg.
Beginning in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetenweg with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the Sternwarte - as well as a "extraterrestrial" site in Diemarden (municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto, which is degraded to a dwarf planet at the end point - are situated exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres.
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than light in the world.
The march to the next fix star would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, up to Garcia, the unrivalled World Boxing Council lightweight champion who went down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federgewicht-Champion.
After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for Pound-Liste.
Garcia stretched the right hand and said: "How do you, Champion?
I wish you good luck. '
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple asked for photos, Lomachenko-Manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"I am a former feather weight," Garcia recalled.
"I got up for bronze [on 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I am small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he must move to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That is what fans demand.
Let us give them that. '
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climate asked if it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-peach debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 Knockouts) also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight triathlon in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode, because all fans asked for it," said Garcia and expressed himself later openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can generate this type of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think the tripartite Champion from Riverside look "very slow, sorry Mikey... you wanted the Ko-Aus".
Garcia said that the focus is to show strength of punch, then boxes.
Both said that they could sense the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be conducted.
No other fight will attract so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I waited for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight. '
Four injured after Reifenplatzer
In an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
After initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost the control of his vehicle at about 4.30 p.m. just before the closing point of the market.
The passenger carried on to the right into the Böschung, where he was swamped and then settled on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial injuries caused by the rescue service, the A7 was locked to the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes for the 2: 2 season start against Braunschweig, that the optimisation of the defense formation in Aue will bring points.
With the first season match Andre Hoffmann was happy, with the result, there would not have been the two counterparts to the 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two counterparts too much, and we have to be even better on Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defender.
In the Ore Mountains, the triangle is also to be further optimized.
And a gateway to a push of free will no longer capture the fortunes.
"For the future, it will be the case that no more than Michael (Rensing) is on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope with the trio even after the experience in preparation than with the Viererkette.
"I do not yet know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we are building on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"It is a prerequisite, but that we harmonise even better and that we do not make so many abusive mistakes in the construction.",,, etc.
Of course Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"Whether or not one can speak after a decision of a failed start, does not know.
The performance may well be okay, "Hoffmann said.
"If, however, we stand by four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season start."
His coach did not want to know about this.
"The start to the season I only judge after six to eight days of play," Friedhelm Funkel said, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely due to an storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favorites in the bones.
"But they don't know 100% where they are at the moment," says Fortuna's Home Defender.
The guests from the Rhineland will meet in the stadium of Aue as a light favourite on Sunday.
"That we sweep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance sheet is positive only in a defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," says Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asylum age screening tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80% of the people tested are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began carrying out the tests last year.
They are to be more precise during the asylum procedure in assessing the age after the Swedish migration authority was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, migration has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person "may have been 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old".
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months.
"We do not see a big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "propose that the investigated person be 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays were closely related to whiteness zones and MRT shots of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves evaluating the biological maturity of humans to see if they used to go through puberty sooner or later.
"I had reason to think about this and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age to judge this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say it safely, we should not pretend that we could "he said the newspaper Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is incorrect is small..
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent. "
Full Plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven tonne concrete section at the bridge was installed at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it runs super", says Reinhold Leicht, building manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Government Bureau Freiburg.
In April the works started at the same time on all three needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete covered with red stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has been in the meantime.
In order to ensure the stability and safety of transport, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red bunker stone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven metric tons of so-called bridge cap on the Wednesday morning on the north side.
This is a fringe attachment which is also used as a working path.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2,20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
That is where the pedestrian path should go.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Particular sensitivity has required the laying of wires through the construction in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fibre optic cable that is connected to many companies.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the works by hand.
In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished first.
A traffic light regulates the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher towards Schramberg.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher Ortseingang, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully locked.
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest bei deutschem Kartoffelsalat at
It does not happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what is otherwise hard to reconcile is coming together.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, left) represented in the Volcanic Eifel Circle are part of a broad alliance, which this day peacefully demonstrates its flag, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites Rondell to the "big campaign event", according to Plakat.
And well-known names are coming to the fore - such as Alice Weidel, who, together with Alexander Gauland, is the top duo for the federal election on September 24, and the deputy president, Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already hours away from the beginning of the event on the ground do not want to listen to the AfD artists, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the slogan "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now it takes place in the parking area below the toboggan track - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful image that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the authoritative organizers, rightly rejoices: "Toll, how many people here have come together".
There is music and plenty of food, including a "urdeutscher Kartoffelsalat, which could also eat the AfD easily," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, they show presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD volcanic ice reports that he made an effort and won the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but got a cancellation there because the already built Laurentiuskirmes did not have enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
With a view to the event on the Rondellvorplatz he says: "This is the good right of people, main thing, it remains peaceful".
This is also the case: at about 20 o'clock, the Rondellvorplatz is a band for entertainment, in the Stadthalle several speakers, including the rheinland-pfälzische AfD-Chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall, some 200 listeners are waiting for top candidates to make their speeches for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
Unmodified is the police presence, but so far officials have had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour takes the AfD event, which guests can enjoy at the Vorplatz, but there is also a short break after 9.
The police can move away - no special events.
Posaune meets Trompete
A reunion with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the slogan "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in the brass music.
Both soloists are winners and laureates of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Thus, Petkov Solotrompeter is the acclaimed Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo songwriter of the SWR Symphonieorchester.
Both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments, but also to merge the borders of the various genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach explores the fusion of classical music, jazz and free play into a fascinating work of art in the two new, Daniel "world music", with of, in, in,,,, in,, in, in,,,,,,,,, and,,,,, and.
This core piece of the program was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it for the two musicians and more: the Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything, "Kristen Stewart quite openly said about her bisexuality.
"When I once passed in grilled cheese, I think: 'Oh that was cool, what comes next?'.
The most well-known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of their "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately fell apart bitterly.
Despite all this, the nice performer assures against the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I've been quoting.
Or do you think I had played it? "
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So I have never been confused or obstructed.
I never liked to be taken seriously. '
In particular, she suffered loud "Bang Showbiz" but during school time, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
I was really very injured.
When I was eleven, the children told me that I would look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself: 'Girls, be proud of you!'...,,, and,.,..,,..,.,.,,.
Especially the public doesn't like to explain to them their love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and annoy me.
And perhaps some call me thankless, but I don't like to have to justify myself to the whole public. "
West Virginia Governor announced that he would change the party.
. West Virginia ’ s Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the democrats have moved away from me, "said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a trainer I would say that it is time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement in advance at West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which the Forbes says is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes finds that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying, "The change of party from Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governements and control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," said the RNC chair Ronna McDaniel in a statement the CBS News.
Coe praises' honest 'Russian apology for doping scandal
The world leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-admitted to sport.
Russian athletic director Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that banishing his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were kidnapped in competitions of gold and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe the reporters.
"The entire council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also 'pleased' that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to restore Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the deceased system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete in the World Athletics Championships that begin on Friday in London, according to the strict IAAF criteria as neutral players.
The head of the IAAF force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still active, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Trauerakt for Mali Crashed Soldiers
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, around 1000 people commemorated the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security precautions.
Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unresolved crash.
She described the two converted pilots as "experts'.
"We bow to this highest sacrifice that they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from Northern Hesse died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali.
Their singers were transferred to Germany and accompanied on Thursday by a death guard from the Bundeswehr in the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At midday, only the members of the Church took the farewell.
After that the wedding ceremony began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and the politics.
He also served as Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Trauergäste laid down roses, the relatives stood in arms at the coffins.
Before the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Secretary of Defense Leyen described the soldiers killed as "highly decorated" and experienced in action.
The Stabshauptmann was the pilot of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his region.
Volker Bauersach, commander of the regime, to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to".
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show ministerial leadership: use is dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife.
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried beside his wife after his death.
That was what the royal house said on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is placed in the cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already completed a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen agrees with the decision of her husband, it continued in the notice.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is not yet clear.
But he has no intention of being settled in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik never made a secret that he was not happy with his title.
After the insult of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired, including "Prince Choice."
As Henrik did not get the title and function in Denmark, which he wanted, he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokesman of the Danish royal house, declared.
Where the last retirements of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is not yet clear.
However, he did not intend to be settled in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Thames in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his fifty-year reign at the Danes.
In a autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: 'A few months after I arrived, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was wavering, I preferred wine instead of beer, soccer socks rather than knitting socks, citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of societal critics of intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
These were two mistakes! '
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick re-election
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country after the loss of the red-green majority in government, but he does not want to step down.
Because on Friday the resolution of Parliament was expressed.
Prior to this, the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had toppled Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s government into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country's election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition.
The previous Green MEP Elke Twesten founded her step with non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU", she explained on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Group Chairman Björn Thümler wishes to recommend that his group accept them.
The CDU and FDP would thus have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD, and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on January 14, next year.
Thümler said that the country ’ s red-green government must now decide whether to govern without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the day of the land should be resolved as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the day of the country deprives the Prime Minister of trust and elects a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These opportunities need to be investigated legally ', said Thümler.
"You will discuss all the issues in peace if they are legally sound audited."
Thümler described Twestens Schritt "doch etwas kurios".
The politician herself said: 'I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. '
She called herself a follower of Black Green.
The Greens called for the disgraceful Members to return their parliamentary mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will immediately return her country mandate, which she received via the green list of the country," said Chairman Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The group chairmen of the Greens, Anja Piel, said: 'We deeply regret the decision of Elke Twesten'.
You have deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
"The behaviour of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters, but also betrayal of Red Green," wrote the Bundeschef of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s decision (SPD) to allow the country ’ s day to be.
Leaving Twestens costs Rot-Grün in Lower Saxony the majority.
In her injured vanity and in her frustration, the politician puts her personal interests before the welfare of the country, "criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue and is trying to make it political capital."
Niedersachsens CDU-Fraktionschef Björn Thümler wants to recommend his deputy to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 election.
The CDU was then the strongest force in the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the parliament.
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoners, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) speech and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves against poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the affected egg chargers.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, as we now know, health risks are virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking the best possible crisis response - all the eggs from the offer - because the central role of the enlightenment of the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs is not really being perceived?
Food monitoring is a task for the Länder.
Nevertheless, my House has sounded up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the German concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are safe for both transport and health.
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded in the case of eggs, they are not capable of transport.
However, contaminated eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it is not the businesses that are to blame.
Do production plants and consumers sit on the same boat?
As it stands, manufacturing companies are not directly blamed.
On the contrary, they are liable for economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there is too little control in the event of a harvest.
Is it only for the staff or for the consistent competence?
It was the official controls that revealed the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out at 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that such events and the handover to public prosecutors are consistent in cases where crimes can be committed that are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide full information.
Is it really necessary to regularly alert food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and safe foods.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The money that has been pumped into this situation means that manufacturers, dealers and consumers are in absolutely no need of it.
As a matter of principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of life-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the facts quickly and fully.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars World Record Transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Saint Germain, France.
Any consequences will still arise for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the leading organisation that oversaw the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair-Play rules, created in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid €222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of $10 million per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.
PSG can certainly make money loose so that Neymar submits it to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy rich family of rulers of Qatar.
clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but they must counteract legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break points in their soccer business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
Former French players believed that if banks or owners withdrew their support, clubs that had made huge debts in their quest for success had effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the club ’ s debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a tougher business.
During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million.
And, while Platini has fallen from the presidency in Ungnade in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to discouraging excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future still," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible at the UEFA for FFP, vis-à-vis The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the invoicing over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer fees for the next five years can be reported at EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, which owns Manchester City, has hit the hardest sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to over-list their financial supervision by raising their revenue through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates, the UEFA would not consider this legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors, and that such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could be easy to find.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than €10 million in 2015 / 16, with a turnover of €542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year still have to be published.
PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jerseys.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and it tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports coons, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"Once a country has an association, everything is possible.
It is going to be very difficult to respect the financial fair play, because you can have different ways or different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country. '
Swiss is on the lookout for a new shoe supplier............
In recent years, Chocolat Frey Bord-Choade has produced for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is coming to an end: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.
According to current plans, the airline will sign a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied," said the spokesman.
Some 17 million small, red-white shoggy boxes weighing 14 grams per year accompany the flight prior to landing on the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to disclose the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros-Tochter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But the advertising effect is more important: for a shoe manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Like many applicants in the new call for tenders, the Swiss does not want to betra.
But only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey is seeking to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018..,,, and, the,,,,,,,
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not reachable for an opinion.
Chocolate tables have been distributed on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, Business Class Nest passengers Schoggi of Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
The Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey, both in business and in economy class, is also spread over the short distance.
Lightweight athletics - Discussion Olympic Champion Robert Harting reaches World Championships
The three-time World Champion fights on Saturday at the finals for a medal.
His brother, Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, failed in the national World Cup bid, and could only look at the competition from the gallery.
Also with the first attempt qualified Polish champion Piotr Malachowski, who was 65.13 meters long, for the final race.
Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" to the niche.
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of characters of the 80s, for the 90-year-old Grunge era (as the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV turned), and for himself - that is, for 2001 before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artefact, it is also a parody and embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a talking can vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By jumping to the heart of the gag - actors of middle age play horny children who are awakened - they still managed to regain the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more by the casting principle, including a reef to the Stalker movies of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that looks the cradle").
At one point, a character through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy malicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan (including Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the courses are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who Matt Dillon's lower lip bart of "Singles" shows, whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old boy.
There are the moments random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I assume as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the gang how it will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka as director, indicates to be a tied TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, fighting for truth, atheism and the way of Marxis-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-anointed Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching Chess on television, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one.
In six long episodes, it moves, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which has been edited to a lesser length, could better deliver its agitprop sounding, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything into a fodder for a voyage.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we are even doing it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Beating the Drug Mafia in the Land
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects were searched, such as the Public Prosecutor's Office Konstanz on Friday morning.
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 years and 77 and have already issued arrest warrants against them.
Moreover, officials ensured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time raids in Italy, two people were arrested.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects.
The two are therefore likely to be shipped to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
More than 300 police officers were deployed.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office has been identifying consistency against organized drug trafficking in the southern German region.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
As a result, the large-scale deployment on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four Palermo officials.
Ins Visier of the investigations made especially Italian citizens with close reference to the Italian mafia.
Also a incident on May 27 in huts where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning should go to the band's account.
Thus, large gaps in the foreigner register are lamented.
'Data from citizens who should not appear ': according to one report, the country register in Germany shows significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
According to the Federal Government ’ s refugee management commissioner, Frank-Jürgen Weise, a media report has drawn attention to major gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to serious errors in asylum procedures and expulsions', warned in an analysis available to the 'Süddeutsche Zeitung'.
According to the register, 10 million people are of foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been maintained sufficiently, data quality in parts has not been good.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, 'of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register any more'.
"Flawed data inputs can slow down returns significantly," says the report.
In the statistics on people who are subject to emigration, it is covered by EU citizens who do not need to travel.
Such false assignments, however, led to a distorted debate on how to deal with travellers' fleets, so it is in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government seems to have begun sending refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children when they have arrived.
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), which reports on the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is resuming such procedures' with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 '.
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, according to the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, the responsibility for refugees lies with the EU State, which they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can return him to the country of entry.
The explanatory statement now reads: 'Meanwhile, the absorption capacity of families with underage children in Italy has increased substantially'.
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries, too, would send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
The internal political spokesman of the Left Group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children are threatening to become a threat to the welfare of children because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system.
The Second Best Result
A total of 220 litres of blood in Oberreichenbach provided blood donation services to other people.
At least 12 citizens who were awarded the prize on Friday.
All the way to Jürgen Greule, who has now shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community pays several times the willingness to donate blood at the municipal council meeting.
"It is ingenious how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood to strangers, even to the unselfish", underlined mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the preserves are broken up into their constituents.
Three people could already benefit from blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in spring.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK team leader.
Obviously, the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half as many are booked Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave 10 times each 500 milliliters of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it reinforces interest rates on family income in the midst of intensifying pressure.
Monetary Committee policymakers (MPC) agreed to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with less members rising this month, as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7%, and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% this autumn.
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to rein in inflation fueled by Brexit, and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic package that was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this system - £115 billion sterling.
minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that 'a certain tightening of monetary policy' would be needed to cool inflation and 'a somewhat larger' extent than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The Bank ’ s downward growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7%, compared to the forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31, and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to change does not come after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest-rate hike, and GDP has risen to 0.3% in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, though it will easily recover after the Bank ’ s demise at the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage increases, as tightening becomes even worse before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" income collapse in the next few years, but she added that wages will recover significantly at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the cut in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound ’ s fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve this fully in terms of prices and the economy.
Before the Bank ’ s last ruling on interest-rate rates, the call for an interest-rate hike had risen, as inflation pushed pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding a 0.5% increase in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said that this was expected and that it would rebound in the coming months.
The bank said that exceeding the 2% target is' very 'to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders are clamoring for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who are running out of existing deals and closing new mortgages, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more popular. '
NHS (The National Health Service) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people.
Patients will have access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September onwards, following a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the NHS drug.
NHS England announced that pre-sexual exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk opiates by about 86%, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the process after last year's appeal court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it.
The chessboard announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS UK chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October, before it is introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious patients.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is used, absorbed, and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September to September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is genuinely individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. '
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now has to be to carry out the study quickly across the country, and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important for this study to be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and to help us move closer to ending the spread of HIV in society. '
The big life: Upstairs and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrank from a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold.
"Before that I lived with my ex-in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne Stauraum wanted to add a mezzanine to make the most of the spacious ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement ', she says.
To this end, she commissioned the Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which uses 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset.
"The steel mill is quite complicated", he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked together, without us having to sit down.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but of attaching the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper window looks down from Retrouvius over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the reflection feels like a window into another room.
The entrance offers divided units for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By perceiving a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Combinable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the stahlverstärkten, furnierten MDF door.
"It is counterbalanced, so if you push the door high, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base floor - or as your property is estimated", says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the ground."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor and simultaneously use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't lose yourself in the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can turn itself into something quite amazing by means of good design and increased square metre number of something standard.
Indeed, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a $500 million property empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victorias ’ largest property imperials worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared.
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 homes worth more than $half a billion, since the family acquired a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of corporate assets and Paul about one-third.
A court ruling says that this means that Colin owns $316 million worth and Paul owns $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The departments proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was best for the objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed mediations.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - as Colin, as Paul claims, ruled out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but rather accuses Paul of managing some ownership incompetence.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian inheritance dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs are rising in the case of hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails and reports by companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides of the Anwaltskanzleien.
De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950's and bought a Brunswick store in the early 1970's.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the first family jetty.
Colin says that he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, have become embittered by the terms of their financial separation.
Colin has been very reticent, even though he was a former AFL board member, and after a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the best friend of television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can not say much" because the case before the courts is.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to draw our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court in a letter that he had tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I in our current dispute would end," he said and added that he "still hope for a solution".
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts," wrote Colin.
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to curtail the president ’ s media abstinence.
Others tried it and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of keeping the head on a more even course.
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House ’ s new chief of staff, met with senior employees on his first day at work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair: poor information that falls into the hands of the president.
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. '
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump ’ s television relationship dates back decades – and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If Trump had been angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs to be persuaded," said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady praise".
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Trump ’ s tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions.
We will probably never hear about the tweets Trump has not sent.
If his staff were able to keep him away from him several times, their efforts would have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - quite preoccupied with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide questionable information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a volcano, can respond to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is keen to figure out where they come from.
Exactly this happened at the end of February, when someone blatantly printed a copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, gave the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh accused of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or has not provided concrete evidence, or has made false accusations in the past, and has revoked them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did this work?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population will be inherited and hoped.
The police all over Europe send in this summer (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted swordsmen are not known by their nature, references from the population are hoped and requested.
Europol reported on Friday of the action that follows on the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar of winter.
Experience has shown that many fugitives are hiding in holiday destinations, as Europol has said.
You have put together 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the web site www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have been recorded so far, at least eleven of them due to references after the publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millions' series'
Some of Midlands ’ wealthiest homeowners are once again faced with some determined travelers on warfare, who negotiated a burial excavated by the community to reclaim a field from their homes.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous road of Solihull, called the "Millions Series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a trench excavated by the Council, in order to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unbridled to find a way.
Angry residents have afflicted the Solihull Council, which said that it is' useless to deal with the problem '.
An anonymous inhabitant said: "They moved there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers-by.
The Council must indeed be forced to implement it, because it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
Travellers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably even more today. "
She added: 'The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by keeping long instructions to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council cannot even stop it. '
A resident who did not want to be called said: "It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of this traveller just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and even a horse has been seen in the parking area. '
A spokesman of the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court has to examine when we submit our case. '
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise will be.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, some 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and income was also lost by the spa tax.
In the autumn of 2014, given the dramatic increase in the number of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collection accommodation, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council.
But, above all, Freudenstadt ’ s Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and spoke of serious interests in the house back then.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back into a three-star Plus category hotel under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise..
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in building waste containers for a long time, and when you enter the house, you will see how extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were removed, ceilings were partially dismantled, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a jewelry on the outside".
Swimming pool, spa area and meeting room are all equipped.
You don't want to position yourself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated inner city level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, wants to broaden, explains Scherer further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups and business people should feel at home in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause have already led him, so Scherer.
The city's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
After the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to commit himself to it.
Nearly under a million euro, he expects.
The exterior units are also mounted on the front, which is already clearly visible.
There is a large terrace in an inner courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US Special Counsel sets Grand Jury
In US President Donald Trump ’ s Russia affair, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
Over the past few weeks, the panel has begun work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, referring to people who are familiar with the.
The newspaper regarded the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The CNN reported that there are already initial charges from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for some time of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation focuses on several men acting as Republican advisers in the campaign.
Mueller reportedly also looked more and more at Trump ’ s private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special counsel had personally moved Trump into the center and investigated the charge of possibly obstructing the judiciary as the affair proceeded.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be made.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called prosecution chambers.
Usually they are switched on when there are major and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to interrogate under oath.
According to CNN, charges have already been issued to turn the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who took part in the meeting were invited to say that it was in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as his former campaign chief, Paul Manafort, were in the discussion.
Speaking on Thursday evening on US television, legal experts said that the idea that Mueller should not be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he should act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body is the start of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total invention," Trump said.
The subject gives the democrats a chance to 'feel good because they have nothing else to talk about'.
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion, he knew nothing of the setting up of a Grand Jury.
But he also usually worked in secret, he emphasized.
The White House is in favour of any measures that could 'fairly' speed up the work of the special counsel.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it would not be investigated against the president.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed, so the statement went on.
But Mueller was not deployed until Trump fired Comey.
Trump ’ s accusations of smoking have become loud, and he wants to impede the judiciary.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to the US media, the White House collected material against the Special Counsel and his staff.
That triggered speculation about whether Trump wants Mueller to be released.
Unlike an independent congressional envoy, such as President Richard Nixon, who later resigned in the Watergate affair, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at urging the president from the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday, according to which the special counsel could not be dismissed as.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has solved itself from the chess.
This was done by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs more than one trillion tons and covers 5800 square kilometres, is now going north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
It has a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, one of the largest ice giants to have registered researchers over the past three decades.
A danger to people does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear, according to research.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice cuffs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factor background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus was part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north of this haggling was the balance of guards and abortions disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shank was destroyed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to be said for the fact that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never gone as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can be broken down if a key spot is broken off.
The melting of hawks and icebergs does not raise sea levels, as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it does after melting itself.
However, the loss of the hawk means that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.
This may raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, the UK research project to monitor Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shaft feis in the Antarctic, according to AWI data, with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.
It regularly breaks down there.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the broadest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly fall together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say that it will be less stable".
But this will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades many icebergs of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen.
This long cistern of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Arctic Peninsula's ice surface has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the fastest growing areas in the world.
CDU wants domestic tariffs for personnel
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU is calling for employers' association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer recess, the District Day marked 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the Mettmann district administration.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teachers at the circle are obviously very much in demand.
Some 620 applications were available for the places to be awarded this year.
However, there is still a shortage of staff to deal with the increased demands and tasks.
There are currently 50 vacancies for Mettmann.
Among others doctors and engineers as well as general administration are invited.
The CDU now wants to join the FDP and the UWG in taking the initiative to counter the shortage of skilled workers in administration.
According to the parties' wishes, the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the scarcity of candidates in the future, that is to say,.,,, and.,,, and.,,, and..,....
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems, which were previously not known.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.
There is talk of genuine 'competition between public employers'.
This includes a large number of employees who retire from the service due to illness or age.
It is therefore time to act, so that no more jobs are left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, CDU leader, goes further than the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a fuzzy surprise in the circle for a faustdicke, when he publicly questioned staffing costs and hid the other parties.
Peoples want all options to be reviewed to allow exit from the municipal employers ’ association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the neighbouring towns - should aim for a house tariff," said peoples.
By doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service collective bargaining system actually provides.
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Law.
Not least by increasing the number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy ’ s Tone for NGO Migrant Rescue Boats
Italy has warned NGOs that if they do not abide by new rules for their operations, they must not continue to do so.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet', because their team had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, and remains the salvation of human life our top priority, so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
"We can only judge all allegations that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and have been able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take hose boat migrants on board, which will be delivered directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers will be able to leave so that ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting took place allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The occupation is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian coastguard, the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search-and-rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not entail 'substantial changes or disabilities' in their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organization Médecins sans Frontières (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue operations has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives, and with Chad, Niger, and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Goes and Trials
Neun Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Castle and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It was followed by lookout points, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pfälzer Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there have been repeated increases for which long trials have been rewarded.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, lookout points lookout point, connected by "flowige" trials and moderate increases.
On the last two days many vertical meters were again called.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shopping huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathe a holistic salvation in the open-air inhalatory.
Neustadt was also taxed.
After 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 metres of altitude, the group had experienced the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Konsole statt Rasen - Bundesliga rüstet sich für E-Sport
Do the sports stars in the future meet in front of computer consoles, instead of having to compete with the stadiums in wind and weather?
Fakt is: E-Sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high Gagen inclusive.
This was also recognised by the first Bundesliga leagues, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
In early 2015, VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04, and later the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July, made two profits for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.
"We hope to inspire very new young target groups for the VfB," says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that on this train still several clubs ascend".
Next weekend, the Football World Association FIFA will organize the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven, for example, have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year old in particular, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be present on these markets far more frequently online than just once a year to send the Bundesliga team to Asia.
What is this all about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or even the soccer simulation FIFA are contested at competitive level.
For a long time, like in normal sports, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And in Asia ’ s 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it really a good sport?
For many, the idea is certainly habitual.
Ingo Froböse, too, has long been grappling with the question.
For the professor at the German Sports High School in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions which can also be found in classical sport - for example increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also train their bodies and watch for nutrition.
"The fitte player is a good player."
But frogs also see problems: "doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls are difficult to implement in online games, and the structures of classical sport were lacking in the scene.
On the positive side, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are on the international stage, which is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverbandes Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts that e-sport will lead to rapid growth.
In 2016, Germany implemented €50 million, mainly through advertising, sponsorship, and major tournaments.
In three years, sales will be 130 million.
Of course, the Euro 2.4 billion of the football league is not enough.
However, the E-Sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey", writing the Dell consultants.
Many countries are already international.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood-Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
Europe is also doing something.
In a Norwegian school e-sport was introduced as a subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the first-league football clubs, according to Dutt, are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board Röttgermann.
To fall into nostalgia alone, and to shrink old times, is no longer enough today.
It is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association, but also of aligning the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," says Dutt.
"You cannot hold on to the fact that only in football everything remains as it has always been."
Poison eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The scandal surrounding poisoned eggs now affects almost all the federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and are selling all eggs throughout Germany.
In the shelves only eggs are to be taken, which are demonstrably not contained in a fipronil.
Michelle Carter, for the texts that Conrad Roy urges to commit suicide, condemns him.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June for negligent killing Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is untröstlich.
My son was my best friend. '
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal.
She was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
In red pants and a creamy blouse dressed, Carter stood with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and looking down as she was condemned.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She finished his life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility, "she said.
"She has shown no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said that it was a 'terrible circumstance that she completely regrets'.
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, have a significant influence on their actions."
A prosecutor read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy, saying that there is "no day on which I did not consider the loss of my beloved son.
I would like him to be proud of me and, like me, to deal with everything.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was being persecuted by the realization that she would never participate in her brother's wedding or be a aunt for his children.
"Not to have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will keep for the rest of my life always with me," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself on, spring from a building, get yourself, I do not know there are many ways," she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "You have to do Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter attracted attention by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the case by any press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Among the few he defended were Amanda Knox, convicted in 2007 for murder of her British fellow inhabitant in Italy before being released two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new Mini Lahm of FC Bayern Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
The FC Bayern does not trust the Confed-Cup winner to have a big season - extra motivation does not harm.
Something was different on his place in the cabin, that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even if the additional garment was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer was to see, he made himself the connected to the arm.
"The trainer did not announce it," the Confed-Cup winner narrated afterwards, after his first bet as a Bayern-chapter.
Good, the booth could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from Coach could also interpret Kimmich this way.
Not the eight-year old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the leader of the existing C-Elf in the holidays of youth players, debutants and professionals.
Sugar distribution is most popular among those who are suspicious of what they want to keep at Laune.
So anyone who has been chosen to attack the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra-motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want to take on as a player: responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old fled the field as a mini-lamb.
Right at the back, this is now his position, the white string at the arm did its rest.
And in this startup formation, as the one who can best take the rudder in his hand.
He gave instructions to try to steer the unused force.
He had a look at the whole thing, while many others were concerned with themselves.
Vidal so that his lack of fitness to play (sounded hardly); Renato Sanches so that on devil come out to make the achievements of the Asia trip (sounded also conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot did not fall negative.
That, after all, worked very well.
Süle ran beside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereign.
The namesake Napoli Sturm often struggled, and additionally, scapegoats tried to succeed in the construction of the game a few times.
His colleague, Mr Rudy, admitted that the result was not as we hoped it would be.
But he also showed a decent performance in the debut.
Moving games, changing tempo: "For this style I was also fetched".
Like uninhabited this Bavarian world is still accessible to the newcomers, one looked at the game afterwards.
Rudy, for example, did not give in the catacombs one or two, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich went on to say a few sticking words in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What has been done here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game ".
After all, he no longer needs to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB-Ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies.
Austria ’ s best-known soccer player reported on Twitter just before the match, wishing the ÖFB ladies well.
The Bayern-Legionär is almost Klubkollege by ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and feebert with our ladys.
The Austrian soccer team Tweet of the year and Champion League-winner should be a special motivation injection.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern-Dusel.
Companies are satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate ministers: Economics praises Wissings Tempo
It was often uncommon, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident more than a year after the new Economics Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) took office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak at T V's request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time pocket the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy on which Lemke has blocked all".
The biggest about-turn is in infrastructure policy: the bridge between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s priority list.
This year, the Ministry is still hoping for a planning procedure until 2021.
A role in the country ’ s plans is also played by the West circumvention of Trier, which anticipates the federal transport route ’ s urgent needs.
The goal is to get the track operational in December 2020, says Minister interlocutor Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce (IHK) Trier is striving to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been going on for ten years.
Moreover, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, praises the IHK.
The Handwerkskammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master coach, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
In the first place, a premium of EUR 1000 for the best master examination and EUR 2500 for graduates who are self-employed within ten years of their master.
The house list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts are to be created quickly, at the same time, the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to employ Wissing at the state operation Mobility, only 29 positions have been filled so far.
The IHK requests to assign more orders to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, a CDU group member, points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than €20 million less in maintaining highways in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of how the country intends to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also sobering to see the expansion of broadband in the country.
In 2016, regional companies assessed net coverage in an IHK poll with only the 3.4 mark.
They complain about stocking Internet connections and declines.
On the other hand, former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe, where, after four months of disagreements, it already cleared the field.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash.
A day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that 'there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions', referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - prohibiting or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of equipment for neutralising exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which could regulate the use of so-called switchgear, emissions, in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested, but in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.

Mordillos Knollennasen and laughter at the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon artists, who are the bones of his characters are his trademark.
Also with 85 the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he was among others a draftsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artists were inspired by cities.
Great, round Mordillo figures meld in drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he is still in the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Over calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, t-shirts, plushy toys and watches, its drollings continue to spread around the world.
For six years he has worked on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousandth of feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is to be released in 2019 on the cinema. are.,,,, and,,.,,,
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he is more interested in the TV series, which, like his original recordings, is wortlos produced.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change.
The lavender is falling because of drought-like conditions and the diseases of infectious insects, causing great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert in agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which brought much less rain in the spring and in the autumn much more.
This has an effect on the lifetime of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbaktery that weathers dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them. "
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender soldering not only attracts holidaymakers, but also perfumes and cosmetics are very much in demand.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. '
The solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary this year.
This Saturday and Sunday is a festival with an average age.
Herbs, guilds, traders, vagabonds or a local slayer should be in the city centre these days.
The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The Riodoce workers typically meet on Wednesday to review their reporting plans for the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials, and interminable drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing what is more secure: they are to take their children to the office, which was the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and belly feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s payroll or the cartel, a catalogue of criminals making Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous.
There is no respite from violence, and while the bodies are accumulating across the country, more and more journalists are in the process: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, with 589 under attack and threats from the federal police, and so far, there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
As with most thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, journalists ’ killers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa ’ s violence, even though it is inherently rosy, and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security, says Ibarra.
"It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we mistrust everyone."
On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks far before his roter Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men.
The shooter drove in his car and damaged it near.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields, with rival factions struggling to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, guessed Gangmitglieder bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave his own security after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold USD 50 holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to practise journalism without encountering the drugs problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and revenue and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish tough inquiries without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in tracking Mexican drug history wherever it went.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You must take on the task that you as a journalist - either you or you play the fool.
I do not want to be asked: "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team mixes Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who like a dockworker could flood, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on their routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his abusers?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like to be bothered by women, their children, their clean shops, their homely runways, and drugs.
"These things were not allowed", said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it is wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier".
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials are at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space in which Riodoce ’ s staff met for security training, no phones were suddenly allowed; days earlier, it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were tasked by the state government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan.
Half in joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were 50% of the policemen who described the governor himself as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters moved to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has clicked on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on state expenditure, which focused on the hometown of the governor.
And there was a group that conducted a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was prudent to write at the time what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the entire century all political levels.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have regarded Valdez ’ s column as the best informed source of abduction.
"Earlier we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez ’ s office has been devoted to storing signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few characters and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on pay and construction sites.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with Sinaloa Governor on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and making them kill because they told the truth.
She has since asked that she be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials involved and an equal society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also by politicians and security forces who organized crime under a cover.
The media guard group "Articulo 19" last year allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth," said Ramirez.
Evidently, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of Maria Elizabeth Macias, the blogger in Tamaulipas, the northern border state, six years ago.
Your body was found together with a note supposedly signed by the Zeta Kartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries, or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who, together with four women, was apparently murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking frightens him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was finished, editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer as once all their phones began to pour.
A series of shootings with bands and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of cartel alliances in the region.
From the brick edge they have published the news on the site of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirene was near - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a glance at the policemen who kept the guard to see if they were ready.
If they were even afraid, they did not.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible throughout Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"Like you can only think of closing", said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the interns asked me to send them to report on the street."
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade his enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa the Dinosaur".
It was so well received that they could even find that his scary skin was of Roman brown - and they said they had had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described it as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His unbelievably well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as' truly remarkable '.
According to reports in National Geographic, the plant-fed animal is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was in Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21, 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to see.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
Researchers have found that this herbivore, though covered with armor and resembled a wall tank, was likely threatened by dinosaurs eating meat.
The highly armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-burial used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed him to meddle better in his environment and avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million year old family creature Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the conqueror shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the shading of the cones is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It points out that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use shading - think of roe, zebra, or girdle - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the chalk time," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including his preserved intestinal substance, to find out what it eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was driven into a river and into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much more inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in early chalk time.
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it.
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs drained the earth.
Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was driven by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tonnes heavier monsters.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was contaminated after death in the sea and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was in Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21, 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.
According to the museum it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long tips that drove his shoulders.
Researchers believe that the pillaged herbivores were swamped by Western Canada until an overflow river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The buried remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains are still hollow pancereal plates along the dinosaur cover.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a profit in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Auctionnal remnants of the skin still cover the hollow panels that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spun upwards.
I can count the scales at his sole. '
In the thunderstorm: mass-carambolage on A8: Many injured
The accident on Thursday evening on the A8: 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are many injured, kilometres of congestion and suitcases.
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) about 20 people were injured at a mass carambolage late on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first data from the police, approximately 5 p.m. between the connection points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were transported elsewhere.
The exact number of injuries was initially not specified.
It was easy to deal with serious injuries, said a police officer.
A large array of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely closed to Munich.
In Fahrtrichtung München, a backlog of about ten kilometres was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also numerous suitcases on the counter-track to massive disabilities.
The fire brigade noted the signs of the drivers who now face severe penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
It was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in".
It is a moment that almost everyone has seen before: nothing can be seen sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
If the Schaffner and wecks an ungentle or rides the passenger out of the workflow.
Passport control.
But the interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the duty-free ticket control system.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus devalue the ticket.
Currently a test operation runs on two lines.
"Come on offer, we extend it.
It will probably be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a rail speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket depreciation without Schaffner.
To use them, however, you have to meet some requirements: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers do anyway.
You also have to buy the DB Navigator via the train's App, which is anyway the most convenient way to book your ticket.
Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get into the train, call his ticket under "My tickets".
A button for electronic evaluation will appear on the test customers.
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that Fahrgast X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant arrives at the ticket control at Platz Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already depreciated online-ticket.
We can therefore continue to sleep, to continue working, to remain silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel without ticket control through our train attendant staff, simply check in at DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time on the train, "says Michael Peterson, CEO of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
If you travel by train often, you know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the biggest problems.
Because you often do not have all the documents you need to upgrade your online-tickets, even if you are travelling with you.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document that must be provided.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the part or the large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and puts the Schaffner at the end of the day to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, sat in St. Louis prayer on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post of someone from the High School.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," he said.
Confused because no one else had posted the information on their feed, they closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah has been constantly betting on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was in the process of killing Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live to tweet.
He postulated an image of browns lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild", Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She used her mobile to return to Tweets later in the evening via people on the Canfield-Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man who claimed to be a father of browns who bore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed, with a policeman standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said she escaped another policeman's gun and shouted: "I'll kill you... all animals."
"This is not common", Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical."
At this moment I felt chilled.
I was angry and wept. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23: 00 she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two promised a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state.
"You only remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I could not take her with me, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
It needs to know and see it and it needs to be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution know what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black child of women.
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it. '
The first station they arrived in Ferguson was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground when activists waited for the potential non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has changed completely after August 9," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has happened. '
Weeks later Ferrell arrived during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came Ferrell to mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?"
This skepticism has been fed by countless cases of people, often white, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centralise their votes and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism rum around death tract inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are presented, because that is how I will be presented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
Moreover, Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in managerial positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. '
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
It insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was on the front line, because in a life at these crossings stands as a black, gay woman so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist..
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
However, she clings to a song and feels bound to this memory since she took to the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. '
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit-gallery gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing since the first presentation 2009 the population in favor and opponents.
Calculates the subject hardly any.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.
While some say to the Bit Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), others say: "Do not need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
While advocates are counting on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will blow out.
In addition, the gallery is planned on the very site where the farmhouse stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying a farm house for many years almost weekly.
Our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the countrymen, are always very happy.
We have also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to see this offer maintained during and above all after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there is.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketing takes place in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of rent rises.
The new project is unlikely to be very low. '
Eva Kilic: "Wozu Einkaufspaläste in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drug or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is already enough of this in our city.
You can see how many shops there are empty - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly directly offered by the producer, and are actually worth the price.
As you can see, retail stores are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer.
It is a pity that there are no more special shops and that what remains of them will probably disappear. '
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not suit me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all, where is the farm market hall going to go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term, if the Bit Gallery actually comes at some point.
Or is Bit-Gallery the spectre of selling all the shops from Bitburg?
George Marquet: "This will simply not work.
And a shopping center that is empty also needs no one.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a proper farm market, rather than this gallery.
But for a farm market hall gib it is thanks to the insane many - like I find - useless construction projects in Bitburg no longer place any more.
When the farmers' market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear. '
A fitting similarity: in Portraits, artist Chelsea Mannings creates DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables of the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarschnitten, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after reporting secretly classified diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A fitting similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transfrau and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits how someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, if somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward, but who has been speaking openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six breaches of the espionage law, computer fraud, and theft.
Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a granular, black and white fever, in which man clearly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came to terms with the great success of her 2012-project Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette mutilation and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people might look.
This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artists and their imprisoned muse became unequal friends of letters, who exchanged letters over the course of two years.
They even created a "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, calling for the release of seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new tweet-capable ways to unleash the inflexible divisions that he was supposed to address.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is endowed with a heart), demanded an end to the "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hopefully will take away from it is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these 30 stories are".
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free phone in the hands of the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
"When they make your speech cold, they have won," it says.
"So never stop the mouth".
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets Philadelphia.
"I still get goose watching when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulacles, which merge like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that also had behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing sought.
A nationwide hunt for human beings is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who are sought as suspects after a man was killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56), Arrest Wars were issued because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranleau, as the acts of the District Court of Cook County show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, after several stitches died.
A Community Warning System published by the Chicago Police Agency states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead on the spot of the event, and detective investigated the Stiche as murder, while the police actively searched for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem has now been certified and excluded from the Campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman of the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged suspects to face the authorities.
"The police has an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them, reinforce themselves," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional, and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a enigmatic tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police is currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will finalize the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Premier Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"In a certain stage of fulfilling the roadmap criteria, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of WADA to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the site of the organization.
According to Mutko, he contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation carried out by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: 'We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist. "
Mutko ’ s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In talks with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.
In November 2015, RUSADA was ruled out by the WADA ’ s doping scandal of carrying out doping checks in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi does not sell eggs anymore.
That divided the business groups.
It was a purely precautionary measure and it could not be considered to have any effect on health.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fiprone anti-Läusemittel.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employee's happiness with your e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.
It has called people from outside to help.
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is on the guard to help companies find out how their employees feel.
Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's commitment, it allows companies to perform surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowern to circumvent the C-Suite managers and address directly to the management board.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools is used by companies to measure employees commitment.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap-polls and surveys of certain teams, it offers a hit card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can check why.
Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain, so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals, since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the Financial Website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent bad behavior and recognize a rising interest and activity early this year amid the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotts, employee turnover and suits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints from employees.
Now that the company employs Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can come closer to this holistic, 360 degree view in experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders against employment disputes."
Companies began taking ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen ’ s accounting firm collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty linen went online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden companies with recurring charges for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that attracts the consent of Venture Capital investors, both of whom have supported start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in February financing from firms like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.
Glitcer secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total financing to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
There is a growing set of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have so far.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only sales.
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices and that the work that you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies go well.
If the analytics tools promise third parties to increase the commitment and commitment of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement after the experts of the workplace culture important.
But the data are useless if managers of a company do not take action.
Indeed, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can cultivate disappointments and workers..,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you will not follow employees ask themselves," Do you really hear me?
Do you care?
And whom do you not care about why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action on the same day, if a problem is reported about Glint, so Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always has new insights into its employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better bond between employees in an industry that is known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for breaking into the two-day practice.
There is a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus at 11 p.m.., and.,,, and.,,,,,,,
Some have pulled out their jerseys and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Football Center the next morning at 6: 30.
"This is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually prolonged its days - at least until the final on Friday.,.,,,,,,,,,,
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day on which the break moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Western wood practical exercises.
In the course of August 18 exercises are to be held, 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the change in the rules of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the busy routing of players.
"We place this enormous burden three or four days on them, and it is very challenging," Mora said.
"And they simply pushed it through, they continue to plack, they are great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it really will be great. '
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of its fields of a adjacent parking and adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of high class that has already been covered with footballs that will be a safety net behind a gate post, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are expected to fill the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to draw an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it is quite a good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8th.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I am therefore not very concerned.
We have a plan. '
Facebook wants to intensify fact-finding in the fight against counterfeit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles to fact-checking auditors from third parties and then display their results under the original entry, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible wrinkles and to send them to fact-checking auditors who may display the results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main points of defense for so-called fake news, many of which believe that it has also affected the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supporting a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to eliminate hastily filled postings as they did before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new fact-checking will be launched.
"In addition to recognizing what stories are challenged by fake auditors of third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "related article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says weeping.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only responded to the thumbprints on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jakobiner," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were himself.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overvalued my welcome greeting") this seems all too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the monastic hymns on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tomb.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape patrons, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "whiskey and began to write".
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust gained full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees began to look after the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, put it on the roof ".
Tagebücher, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that depict who possessed what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.
Young, let everything go its way! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer rebellion in 1381.
"There is a record of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 at the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"Farmers' revolt began in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start.
Perhaps the two are linked? '
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron who hid the family Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: 'Messrs seemed to be pretty crooks, keep on debt and spend money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men redeemed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them to be a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to advertise successors. "
After the end of his work at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like: "Oh, now I have to cope again with the damned life."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf enveloped.
With the contraception of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (Rundschau of Thursday).
Until Thursday mayors Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Artz the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too beautiful for us.
Or? ", ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think this (of course!)," they write on their website, which was released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some is better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that we, as Bad Honnefer, know citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it means more.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique feature".
After all, it is competing with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can claim a mid-five-digit amount of its new roof brand and campaign costs.
Military reforms in Turkey – Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army
Each year in early August Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council (YAS) on retirement and promotion in the officer corps.
This week, too.
At first glance a normal operation.
But nothing is routine in Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The Heads of Government now also chaired the discussions with the five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and External Action.
This meant that civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government attracts the reins in the military.
Although Hulusi Akar remains in office, the army ’ s commanders, the air forces, and the navy have been deposed. the, the, the, the,, the, the, the,,, the, the, the,
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army ranks – mostly because of alleged connections to the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen ’ s movement, which Erdogan sees as the protector of the coup attempt.
Since this week, negotiations have been taking place in Ankara with 486 people directly involved in the coup attempt.
Even on the day after the coup, Erdogan described the coup attempt as a "godsend" because he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really manage the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unbehagen im Militär-Hauptquartier".
In general terms, there are concerns about the increasing 'Islamisation' of the army, which manifested itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the army and the security forces continue to be the main target.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered another 7395 civil servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers, to be appointed by decree.
It seemed that Erdogan was taming the military.
The generals used to be the real masters of the country.
Three times, they invoked their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his 2002 victory, Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step, not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reforms.
Former officers say that Erdogan is purposefully Islamizing the armed forces.
In the magazine 'Vocal Europe', a so-called officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned the Turkish army of 'full extremists and salafists' in a few years' time.
If that is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts in the alliance about the Turkish army's readiness for action after the cleansing.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are 'weakened', say NATO diplomats.
Washington Changes the Rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for legal immigrants to be reduced to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way citizens are spent from other countries Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and to show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to sanate track for racetrack hut
Over the past few months, the future of the race track hut has been contested again and again - now it should be done very quickly.
Even before the end of the year the marods track on which the tourist track is going to be built is to be built.
In order to ensure the future of the racetrack hut in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, work is to start on the track this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country has committed itself to this important link, especially for tourism," explained Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country takes 75 percent.
The Treaty, on the basis of which the shuttle is also to be ordered from the country in future, is currently being finalised, Mr Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operator agree on the technical details.
"This is the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the race shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular rail connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
Over the past few months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by enough people to re-order it regularly in future.
The track is also heavily built in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about doing so.
Just as you thought that 2017 could not be even more crazy, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yes, indeed.
Sex-robots are now a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the breast wart and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but companies deliver lots of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberate human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also customize his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the chest warts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more worrying, as many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a step-ford-woman look progressive.
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics that they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there is the Roxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible", Swarming the site of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she does not like what you do not like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - like real people!
You can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can be "in mood"!
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the subservient female properties, the allusions to rape when one goes on frigid (that is, defiant) Farrah, worries the most.
On his website compared True Companion Roxxxy with a Vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a Vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxxy?" means it on the site.
However, these sex-robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and growing sophistication point to a little darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subservience as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its rising popularity, they remain on the margins of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks from the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are appearing at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has irradiated from attacking women sexually.
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the twisted bodies and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex-robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (though with porn star-proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, put on the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
You cannot separate from your pet or simply walk away.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the fantasy of total subjugation.
In other words, they are slaves.
Or, to put it bluntly, in 2017: powers of service
Trump ’ s Great Performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.
It has become a trump card in the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Erntedankfest, there were advice in the US about how to deal with Trump ’ s horror.
We are all supposed to be bursting around our filter bubbles.
Less noticed is Trump ’ s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and uniquely on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing in terms of the table, but it strikes me in another context that it also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the distorting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about 'normalisation' and Trump, we are referring to the gruesome possibility that one day his guards will no longer bite us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump normalizes right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear to be an embodiment of income compared to his standards.
I find myself today struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s comic version of the crazy – the dog on the car roof, who knew 14% income tax (but at least we saw his tax declaration) – both of which seem very mild compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the Central Park carousel, the largest carousel in New York ’ s park department, and the best three dollars spent in the city if you don ’ t need a cafe.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarce and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely finster and the climate-permitting music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of high buildings will be old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a major roundabout in northern London.
The Central Park carousel is still a strange experience, however, as here two two-year olds, one 11-year-olds and two women in the 40-year-olds can go to it and all have a great time.
If I had been able to assess the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked for it..
On the other hand, this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffeehouse on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the assessment with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the Ladin.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to put personality in a situation where none is needed.
The poor woman in the department store apologized grinsend, while I weary the experience made her credit card with five stars to be.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred to hospital with breast aches from prison.
Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts in his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, he suffered in one case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against an initial death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine ’ s Day in 2013, several times by putting a door on the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night intruder who hid in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention, this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, to appeal that they say they are too lenient.
The National Criminal Authorities said that they would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg.
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the four clandestine pupils from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed into holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the students will go to the secondary school in the future, four to the real school.
Leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school omission, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken house, but then is released into freedom.
In addition, the more mundane Schar conducted a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it break out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning him a chicken crushed the eagle spread on a high mountain his wings and vanished.
After that, the classes showed three and four in the introduction of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young Gockeln, the cylinders carried around the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said head of the School Angelika Sitte.
The kitten is different from the other kittens (chicks), but they belong to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His rule is to be free.
She wanted every four-legged student to feel at home in his new school.
Members of this House thanked former school leader Michael Müller, who always jumped in at school passports, and the parents' representatives.
The chicken time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
They leave their students very reluctant after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, they have been able to rely on the quarter-barrels.
At the end, all students had a song from summer time and holiday time.
It was a great pleasure for the children.
For the new school year eight first-class students are already registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece, informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted on television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal people were arrested in Sithonia by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released, while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camps and are imposing substantial fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected now need to know
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should diesel drivers take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the performance of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have thrust software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofit has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration (KBA).
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet set a precise date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to each person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, that will be done within its framework.
How long will the changeover take?
"Heavy to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on the political pressure.
"Because we have seen voluntary action by car manufacturers on the environment so far not."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It might be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do car drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE is waiting for you.
Presumably, foreign manufacturers would follow suit, Smetanin said.
Is there a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize-giving ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the laureates does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, there were also singers Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographers Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be given at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and, together with his wife Melania, participate in the award.
The Lear award winner, who has become famous with progressive TV series, therefore announced that he would not participate in the gala.
The New York Times said: 'This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that is a burden on me'.
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We Make the City Lifelong
Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will be retiring next year.
The job is already advertised - suitable applicants are, however, rar.
Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work still gives him great fun, as he mediates in the press interview.
He reports varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the earliest opportunity.
The intention is that, while respecting the regular notice periods, there will still be enough time to prepare for them.
Since Haslach acts as a subcontracting authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present appropriate qualifications.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they could no longer fill it, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But closeness to the citizens is important to the city and to itself, Wacker says, who reports of a good working climate and good mood between the authority and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living", he is sure about the construction office and its employees.
But there are also varied projects on the agenda in the future: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatze, for example, has been initiated.
The cinematic bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still the subject.
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million if we get it right.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. "
There is plenty of room for a city builder to design.
With Haslach's own Bauhof and Gärtnerei it can be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to have an eye for what fits "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder stresses.
In any case, the mayor of the city bears a heavy responsibility.
He is a builder, "at the end everything goes over my table".
He can count on many years of support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) has been there for 15 years.
Even that his successor stays long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and stay with the place".
Continuity is important not only for a good business climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to prove a completed degree in engineering or a Bachelor of Architecture after information from the city of Haslach and have a good knowledge of construction and planning law.
The Municipal Building Office is responsible for the construction, construction and civil engineering, land management, administration of the municipal properties, the Municipal Works Court with the Bauhof and the Municipal Gardens as well as the Lower Building Law Authority, including monument protection.
Cycling on circuits: South railway line locked.
According to the police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the scene were observed by witnesses a rose-tinted scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a whim bubble," said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch on APA.
The perpetrators, or the perpetrators, would have endangered themselves in great danger, as well as rail transport.
In addition to the damage caused to the locomotive and the facility, as well as the delay and the cost of rail replacement traffic, pawns at the railway customers could also be provided for the perpetrators.
All in all, it is a 'substantial' sum, said the speaker.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, and rail transport on the southern railway line could be operated without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains left Friday morning, two of which affected long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fall, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products, and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory disease).
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in carbon-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable state of affairs that affects the US, at around 1.3 million, and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach contractions and vesicles, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote tolerant intestines.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that intestinal immune cells patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it may result in inflammatory disease.
In experiments, it was found that a form of tolerance occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacteria species - lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in Tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestines when the same system also affects humans.
The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of mafias had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had been separated, but that had not.
She suspected that the difference with the intestinal problems of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice ’ s demons were sequenced to DNA, and six types of bacteria found in mice with the immune cells were found, but without them in mice.
Moravians were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal robiom and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria had an impact on the immune system, researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to immunological cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerant supporting cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in mice ’ s feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50%, but when the Tryptophane values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant supporting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri in our stomach tracts protect.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophane values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic.
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a genius, Jose Mourinho believes, after midfielder Mittwochabend had his debut against Sampdoria.
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched to popularity.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes, which allowed Mourinho to improve League season before the premiere.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also stared in the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
This week, the Independent revealed that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to meet three of its four priority commitments.
"Three of four to get, for which I thank the association," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get for me four of four, but they have taken great trouble."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner about the U.S., which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner to be.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader, socialist prime ministers in the run-up to elections always looked after Berlin with some concern.
Bloß did not disturb the central party party, just not a counterwind from the federal government - that was the main wish of the campaign fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD governed provincial capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in terms of headwinds..
It was rock-bottom.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Rot-Grün cannot simply govern reliably," said CDU-Secretary-General Peter Tauber the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising party leader of a Green MEP toppled Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government (SPD) in a severe crisis.
Five months before the country elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition.
The German founder Michael Kellner invited the dissident Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to give back her mandate.
The transition to the CDU is a clear distortion of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate, "said the German Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"All this must not be true," a SPD campaigner joins forces when, on Friday morning, the new Hiobsbotschaft reaches the party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, SPD ’ s prime minister of Lower Saxony, is named after the transfer of the Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU without his own government majority.
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The plight began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no longer, the comrades reassured at the time.
After the general elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That became clear - and it was all much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the pigeon, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party smooth.
Hardly enough, the comrades returned in the weeks thereafter.
Then, when they just had new courage, the G20 summit in Hamburg came.
And with him came the next deep strike.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost to that weekend his nimbus because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because he did it quite wrong in crisis communication after that, what can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has struggled for his political survival.
Now, then, Stephan Weil..............
Due to the VW Abgasaffäre and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been under criticism for some time.
Miese Umfragewerte added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because in recent weeks has been increasingly trying to set accents in the federal government.
The ambition of Hanover ’ s former mayor to expand his power in Berlin was not concealed by Martin Schulz ’ s comrades.
They allowed him to, because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
It is because the internal dispute of the Lower Saxony Greens is basically not to blame.
And Schulz has not.
For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their own.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and especially at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democratic, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the left-wing party in the SPD Bundestagsfraktion, the editorial network Deutschland (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but because of the country list of Lower Saxony Greens, so the Lower Saxon Member goes on.
The logical consequence would be that it should return its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestagsfraktion, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The electorate was clear four years ago: People have Stephan Weil as prime minister," says Oppermann, who runs the Lower Saxon SPD as the top candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now the personal career memory of a future CDU member falsifies the election result," said Oppermann.
He called for clarification of the background.
I want to know whether there has been more or more commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Funding for Ortskern III
Anyone who wants to renovate his house, which has been bought for years, will soon be able to receive support from the country.
In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG Stadtentwicklung informed on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a retrospective of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been recovery areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the Sanierungsgebiet I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg still took over two thirds of the amount of funding.
In the rehabilitation zone II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "success project" - unless it is ultimately important to promote the development of the interior as well, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Government Bureau of Karlsruhe informed us that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The grant amount was EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a rehabilitation area created?
They will continue to study, according to Schindler, where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest whatsoever in the area planned.
If necessary, the territorial borders could then be postponed again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal program "Social City", in which frameworks would then be performed.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out objectively, that is, on a per plot basis.
Finally, the rehabilitation area would be set as a statute.
The grant period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
By September of this year, however, stocktaking would be carried out only once, in which those involved in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire.
In November or December, the decision on saturation should be taken as far as possible, so that remediations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then declared that every municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a matter of assessing and deciding when and to what extent urban planning is being remedied.
It will then also be entered in the land registry for the land in question.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and make a picture of the situation, promised it.
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and plot sheet", which deals, among other things, with the construction condition and the restructuring intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the budget and housing sheet, information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be made.
The blue "Arc of operation" can only be filled if the premises are operated.
It should be noted, however, that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler emphasized that the distribution of subsidies according to the "greyhound principle" works - who comes first, exhorts first.
You cannot reserve any subsidy money for later ".
At the end, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make the attendees a rehabilitation "tasty".
British inventor himself uses a microchip to get into house and car with a hand movement.
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office and even start with a hand movement his car.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and index fingers and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by its company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cats and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The decision of the White House to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlighted American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers according to military data left to the TIME magazine, up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire-fighter and a Mississippi forklift truck.
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on 17 July, at 7 a.m., and that until the pitch was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the restriction of service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight.
The original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event, while the security staff remained on the ground during the flight.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could infringe the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Blades as if you are locked," replied the Deputy Commander.
The event "Made in America" was called the official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president initiated health-care reform reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But to request their use only for a photo OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential aircraft, against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxidienste, and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about the use of the president ’ s aircraft by his predecessors., the of.
"The White House is thrilled by the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states shows produced by American workers using American materials," said the Deputy Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX 1 crews often conduct training flights around Washington and the South Lawn to estimate the US president in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was in Germany at the G-20 summit in early July, HMX-1 landed 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant.
Helicopter units additionally flown 11 hours on this day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers were not shouldering the burden for any of the other Requisitions presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in suspending the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have budget records for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to hourly rates by the US Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24.380 per hour.
Recordings of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"The cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance, and contract closure.
At that time, the former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter ’ s deployment for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things made in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasise this. '
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he viewed his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver ’ s seat of a firefighter.
In the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of business products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss on a tricky task
Top runner of the second tennis Bundesliga is the third player in the table.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss starts tomorrow at 11 a.m. at the Tabellendritten Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five matches, the top runner of the Second Tennis League still has a flawless record for reality.
Teamchef Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formations.
Especially on the back positions I find the team very good. "
For class and stability in search villages SV ensure above all imports from the High North.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to bets in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double ", says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"That will be as difficult for us as ever.
You also need a good portion of luck. "
The new team for the trip to the High North stands practically.
His debut for Blue White could give Maxime Janvier.
If you are a French player, don ’ t miss the chance to play in the Czech Liberec Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic).
The hitherto unwon Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was in Kitzbühel yesterday with the White Russian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament.
He should be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgier Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could join the team again.
Wealth for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was number one in January 2016 in the junior world ranking, does not fill someone out of the coaching team at Marius Zay.
How America Can hurt OMV
Indeed, Donald Trump was not happy when he signed Trump ’ s centenary bill to tighten sanctions on Russia.
"In his hatred to enact the law," the Congress passed a few "unconstitutional regulations", he estimated.
The Moscow response, too, was as harsh as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of US efforts.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors from OMV, which co-finances Nord Stream 2 with other European companies, have been worried about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea ice.
The drug regime is violent.
Nevertheless, it is too early to estimate the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would have to revive the sanctions by executive order.
Twelve weapons are at his choice.
"The press" has looked at which of the Group could defend itself and which could really hurt it.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be put at the centre of the series of hits by Netflix.
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobars Killer reveals, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The relays three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali-Kartell.
Led by four powerful sponsors, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type inviting American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city provides 46 kitchen aids a one
The town organizes the Kita lunch trip itself.
With strong contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the municipal nurseries.
On September 1, the town of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the municipal children's facilities (Kitas) again in its own hands.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy director in the field of youth aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased". and.
Gekocht will continue to be outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies fresh cooked food.
The town operates 46 day-care centres in Krefeld, where 44 children get a warm meal for lunch.
In the last kitajahr there were 2800 children sitting at the tables each and the demand is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children, who are cared for 45 hours a week, eat in the Kita at noon", explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour service if children stay until 14 o'clock".
46 part-time workers have the kitchen service from 1 September: they warm up the food supplied, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, port the meal individually, give the food, clean it, wash it and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the hourly range.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for kitesurfing to implement pedagogical concepts".
This is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"Children should help to prepare food".
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
For children too.
"They have a known force in the kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - previously also the job of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has the charm, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen service, that it has proved to be the most economical in terms of cost comparisons between own government and foreign procurement for the city, i.e. from the press.
And that, though 46 part-time workers will be reset.
"But these hours do not carry so much weight with about 750 people in the educational field," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN.
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will stand in provincial elections in the Council elections, with three women standing for the role of Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters being women.
"The role of women can not be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, elections will hand over power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next one.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men are trying to kill 13-year-old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to deprive a 13-year-old girl.
According to information from the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who kept up with friends at the Kolping Street, at 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to telephone the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with her friends.
In response, one of the perpetrators tried to attack the cell phone and the girl's necklace, but for a long time.
Without loot the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
Investigations are under way.
GMB concerns about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to reassure McVitie, the Biskuit manufacturer, about the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company has weighed over the future of investments at Tollcross-site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which besides other products produces hobbies and Rich Tea biscuits.
McVity ’ s owner, Pladis, said that he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be "experienced first" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's chief executive, GMB Scotland McVitie's called for "expressing concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward".
GMB-Senior-Organisator Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we can not gain clarity from the General-Site-Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is focusing heavily on the local community and the Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the perspective of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living, and chronic decline in output, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing McVitie production presence. "
A spokesperson for Pladis said: "The head of the subsidiary at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly to this, as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate, are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than GBP 5 million in our Tollcross-site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site and we fully acknowledge that if our operations change at the site, employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this. "
Did the PSG Barcelona warned Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga likes its interest in Marco Verratti regret
Paris Saint-Germain will not drop in her pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did she warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record outbreak?
The sensational approach fueled the summer transfer window, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning for £89 million to Manchester United last season.
After the end, Neymar will become the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest-paid professional athlete. PSG wages of more than GBP a week..
Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the catalan stock insists that the club has always given its best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.

Interview: "Domspatzen-Bericht entlastet Papst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on abusive cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the Reformmovement "We are Church", declared after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects from the former Regensburger Bischof and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the Cathedral kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or misjudgement of what happened at the time.
The Vatican Chancellery "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the fact that, in reporting on violence, double standards are applied to the domains.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is' shameful and shameful deeds' that should be punished and prevented in future; but it is conspicuous by the 'degree of media manipulation', according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal", writes Scaraffia.
In an interview with the Bavarian radio station Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said: "You are happy to go to the church and this is a fancy".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a very normal pedagogical means" to deal with cheeky children, as I was, ".
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuse cases, it is often the case that Pope brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.
Unjustifiably, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the reminder book "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440 page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, charged with enlightenment by the Bistum Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen have been sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "In summary, it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. used physical and psychological violence in many cases.
Especially with high emotionality the punishment for the students could be even more severe.
Despite this, in contrast to many other defendants, it is striking that many victims value the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him despite violence. '
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440 page report on the 'incidents of the use of force in protective foals at the Regensburger Domspatzen' gives a contradictory picture of the cathedral captain Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who became more effective when a dome vocals did not produce a top performance.
How do you view this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why Georg Ratzinger's name comes in.
He is currently on eight pages, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The texzesse violence at the preschool also took place outside its sphere of influence.
At best, he can be accused of being too late or of not taking the first suggestions seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, presents an excellent testimony, describing it as "warm", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "sympathetic", as extremely benign teachers, who regularly mailed the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbonbons and "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to anger.
The fact that he not only threw the keyring on the ground with his stools, but also spread earlobes and pulled too cheeky boys to his hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
But his salvation must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the time in question, the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s, with parents like teachers.
Do you know any of these breeding methods?
Of course, I think each of us born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence at the preschool, these are, of course, trivial.
One wonders whether it has more to do with his popularity and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed to him.
Many of the Bavarian pope who never understood him are still eager to work.
However, the truth is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media a lot has been reported in connection with the report on the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger report any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: No.
Not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Cathedral kapellmeister.
Not even the parents were consecrated.
"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said one of the victims on behalf of the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was, and still is, that most of the victims are silent.
If they did not even trust parents and siblings, certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators on a professional basis.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger ’ s role with regard to abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: As one questioned student put it, "With regard to sexual abuse... I do not see a case in which it would have had (Georg Ratzinger) timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I also think it really absurd to assume that he, of all things, has been more inclined to penetrate or clarify, or rather have opened up, than to her parents, boarding schools, trusted teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion: 'The fact that he was able to trust pupils and / or their environment in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation'.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is entitled to be released from any fellowship.
He cannot be accused of not preventing or displaying him.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read of "violent texzessen" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Georg Ratzinger, the former cathedral captain, is accused in the report of 'looking the way'.
Must he live with this charge?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything has been mixed up and mixed up in the coverage, into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
After all, it is neatly separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Cathedral treasures, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral conductor of the Cathedral Treasures.
All the terrible caning pedagogy, the cases in which boys were harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most witnesses emphasize, was the subject "preschool" taboo.
One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.
What was different about the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger, who concludes that "many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him".
At most that remains the charge of looking away.
But, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported of the conditions at the pre-school.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not actually and responsibly, (according to the witness) did not want to hear anything, and only then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently keep his ears shut before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduces the report.
In this he points out that 'the practice of caning continues in the pre-school'.
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action..,,.,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when caning was banned in Bavaria long ago.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the limit was really exceeded.
However, one cannot say that he has always looked the other way.
That is simply not true.
It was not until 1980 that caning in schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.,, and.
How do you see this?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "Fallstrick of anachronism", that is, the danger of assessing it by moral standards today.
The prince is right there.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and which does not apply to what happened at the pre-school level in the event of opposition and violence against innocent children ’ s souls, which goes far beyond what was then the practice.
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked on.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, cowardly hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
As a physical punishment was then banned, he has also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his Regensburg era did Georg Ratzinger give in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Is the subject of caning also on the agenda?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, telling from his perspective, because the Cathedral Treasures played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not deny that he led a strict regime there.
But this must also be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution from the national known Regensburger Domspatzen until then, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and bonbons alone, you don ’ t even make big singers out of recalcitrant boys, and before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of people did you experience with Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and always again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deep believing and hearty good people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything other than a fly.
I regularly get in touch with him, as many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his Emeritation, to keep him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who still do not forgive him that he was even too strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the Cathedral treasures are grateful to him today for enriching his life and bringing the world of music closer to them.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect man, to whom they are still watching today and who worship them.
Once again, I would like to make it quite clear that everything that he is accused of is educational methods that were then on the agenda.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this period.
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make media scapegoat.
That is the bad intention behind it, all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and who would probably not know the Regensburg Cathedral treasures outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany would finally be allowed to live in peace.
