Usually two : never drink the black sau .	-3.0488
And Spritz .	-1.7081
And the round of Eierlikör , the Ina around half melts , also let away .	-6.5054
Alcohol consumption is truly written to the 43-year-old .	-5.1164
His fans sent a few tips to fight the offspring .	-4.7070

The problem has already been raised in the Radstadt Council .	-3.7062
A solution has not yet been found .	-3.1095

In principle , Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the Haaße-Hügels .	-2.4733
It must be made more attractive .	-1.3887
With the frequency of the radar channel , you can be very satisfied .	-8.5715
The tourist marketing is still eligible .	-3.9764
Our cycle path is very high quality compared to other ADFC members in Germany .	-4.4089

We have not seen this in other parts of the city .	-6.1180
What were the textures connected with ?	-3.3560
Hiltruper Lake and the market alley were often mentioned in places .	-5.7370
Rolf Ihmig arbitrated the Allee in his striking song to " Kö von Hiltrup " .	-4.6891
The cultural station was also appreciated .	-3.2982
Alvin Jasic has always been involved in the experience of co-existence in these places , especially .	-8.5621
Karl Franke revived the short cuts with short interviews with interpreters or hints about their work .	-6.3200
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry , but now he also taught guitar .	-5.8857

A whole CD can be Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann .	-2.0321
Other musicians can record a song : Ihmig with his help drummer , the Franke especially with his musicality impressed , and the Lummerland-Rudel : " a very beautiful performance " with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon , Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle .	-5.7521
Like everyone , children joined the final once again - and even without electronic support " right " , as Franke said .	-5.9695
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality , with regard to Hiltrup , intimacy of melody and recognition .	-5.8896
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian school for music , Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahler from the economic association and Jan Kaven , chairman of the city ’ s offensive .	-5.1942
The city ’ s offensive was the occasion of its tenth anniversary .	-4.5723

The players form two teams that sit opposite each other .	-3.7198
For each page there is a screen , it contains four cards with keywords that you can remove - the old trick with the red slide - when you put it in .	-6.6549
This ensures that the other side can not read anything from the error .	-6.8347
On the cards , for example , you can read from left to right : " 1st Renaissance .	-5.2117
2 . Window . . , , .	-6.2922
3 .	-0.7304
4 . Feast " .	-5.6737
These are the terms that need to be encrypted .	-3.2113
Because errats are not meant to be the terms , but codes .	-4.9902

But the farmer had already finished filling specialties .	-4.9603
He opened his " treasure chest " and presented the older visitors the latest feathers .	-4.1124
The demand for the good drop " Made in Füchtorf " was correspondingly large .	-3.8659

Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat , coaches André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointing profits from Hanover 96 and spoke to them courage .	-5.3144

A scalp of Lucas Torró ( 17 ) was first brought in danger .	-7.7208
Six minutes later , Sébastien Haller became richer in his position at the last moment of the 96-defense around the Brazilians Felipe , who fell short of Kevin Wimmer ( back ) , stopped .	-6.4682
The leaders of the Hausherren almost inevitably fell and deserved .	-4.7398
Filip Kostic hob the ball after a defensive corner in the penal room , Haller extended his head to the gate where Ndicka needed only the foot .	-5.8066
It was the first Bundesliga reffer for the French two-league AJ Auxerre in the summer .	-8.4620

After the rumour has already been made , the damage could be more precise and the individual tenders could be prepared more specifically .	-7.2965
It is true that the renovation is more expensive than planned , because the damage that has already been done a few years ago is greater , but it has also been noted , which was only possible by means of an injection .	-10.7738
The Sockelverputzarbeiten are completed , before the winter is to be started with the natural stone and one hopes to finish the half of this work this year .	-7.0737
Einweihung : Neues Wohnheim in der Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße	-2.1962
The Donau-Iller lifestyle aid opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße .	-4.9186
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße now " a very special house " is handed over to his provision - there were all those present at the inauguration ceremony .	-8.2523
After all , the twelve wheelchair users who already live in the residential home of Donau-Iller have been dependent on the special architecture of the new building for some time .	-6.3724
Wide corridors , corridors and doors , larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas has architect Rudolf Bader taken into account in his concept .	-4.1554
The first plans began around eight years ago , when the former US Army officer building was placed on the test bench for the residents of Handycap : " The house had not come in the years and did not have more time in the equipment , " explained Bader retrospectively .	-8.3050
In 2016 , the excavators crashed around the house .	-3.6720
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible , so that the inhabitants can feel at ease , so the architect .	-5.7377

About EUR 4.6 million invested in new construction .	-4.1633
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million , the district of Schwaben 450000 euros .	-3.2857
The construction works have remained within the planned framework , according to the architect Bader , as well as financially .	-6.1029
He also thanked the Managing Director of Life Aid , Jürgen Heinz .	-3.4875
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time humid construction has not always been easy .	-5.1246
However , the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allow the inhabitants to experience the freedom , even without moving outside help .	-7.1111
Similarly , the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben , Gertrud Kreutmayer , said : " The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants , who need tools to be mobile " .	-6.6213
In doing so , the residences and functionality were combined well , said Kreutmayer .	-5.0106
And further : " The plot in this situation is a real fortune because it is no longer to acquire it in today 's situation " .	-5.6013
Altogether , the new residential home in Münsterblickstraße offers almost 1500 square meters space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three living groups .	-5.6018

Germany : Schwesig laments differences between East and West	-1.7679
Berlin - Prior to the day of unity , the deputy SPD chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to be found with the disadvantages of East Germany .	-5.7104
There are differences that are painful after almost 30 years of unity .	-3.2501
With these differences , we must not be satisfied , " said Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , the " Tagesspiegel am Sonntag " .	-4.3985
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country .	-2.7176
It is unacceptable that East German workers worked longer than the people of West Germany , but 15 % less pay .	-5.0521
" I can explain this almost 30 years after the German unity nobody " , said Schwesig .	-4.1729
North Korea : Does this putty dog end the Korean conflict ?	-3.5390
The one-year Pungsan-Jagdhund is supposed to smooth between the two Koreas .	-4.6099
In an effort to relax the relations with Seoul , Pjöngjang made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungsan-Jagdhunde .	-4.5054
As Moons Bureau announced on Sunday , the two about one year old dogs reached their recipients on Thursday .	-4.5512
They therefore passively conquered the border location Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the animals ' ' reconciliation .	-7.6453
The dogs with the thick white coat , spitting ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent .	-4.1370
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .	-2.4194
The Friendship had announced at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korea ’ s leader Kim Jong Un in Pjöngjang in mid-September . , , , and . , , . , , , , , ,	-8.1547

For the 100th anniversary of the Republic , which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year 's commemoration , numerous new books have appeared , which usually answer this question in retrospect to the past hundred years .	-6.1065

New week , New Chance for the Government	-1.4690
Back to the work of the state - that is the unofficial motto for the grand coalition that is starting today .	-7.0051
Hardly an interview , hardly a speech in which the chancellor and its ministers from CDU , SPD and also from CSU last but not least the " return to the subject " mantraartig beschworen .	-7.3537
This may be the case with some craftsmen , doctors , cashiers and other people working in that country , who are justified in asking what is actually the difference between work and work , but ' s drum .	-8.7234
If the federal government is now , once again , to dedicate itself to its task - to governance - it should not now be held with concepts of it .	-8.3963
Whether or not the Union and the SPD , following the provocations and bubbles of recent weeks , will actually be able to bring something together , may well prove to be the case on Monday .	-8.6103
In the evening , the leaders of the governing parties to the coalition committee come together .	-5.2043
German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early ; a lesson from all the disputes .	-4.3870
First of all , however , there are conflict-ridden subjects on the agenda with the diesel equipment and the specialist labour law .	-7.2083
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange-rate premiums , SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the duty of technical retrofitting of older diesel .	-7.4581
During the Diesel Crisis , a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend , and SPD is still far apart in the planned specialist immigration law .	-7.5999
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers working or training .	-3.9941
The Union is strongly opposed to the ' change of track ' from the asylum system in the labour market .	-3.2192
So there will again be controversy among coalition partners - and how should it be different ?	-4.0622
Not equals and equals has joined forces to coexist , but three partners with very different social models and priorities .	-7.6550
Discussion is good .	-2.6064
Without quarrel , a society that is so diverse , sometimes contradictory , does not advance .	-5.7440
However , in order to be constructive , there must be no dispute again for partisan reasons on the question of being or not being built up .	-6.9139
It is still about politics , not theater .	-3.1555
The Union and the SPD are supposed to be striving - but always the reality of people 's lives .	-7.8919
What is feasible and useful ?	-1.7708
With this key issue , both diesel and spurchange issues can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence .	-6.0666
Above all , the People 's Party must now fight . .	-3.6981

Daniela Holzinger wants to look more closely at this .	-2.3913
" Really day and night " their legalists worked on social security reform , reported a surplus social minister during the presentation of the same two weeks ago .	-6.0645
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger , the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein ( FPÖ ) meets with reference - it now brings the matter to Parliament via question .	-4.8903
They assume that the ministry only expressed their enthusiasm for the deployment of their teams and did not want to proclaim infringements of the service law before the cameras running .	-9.1820

Since early Saturday morning the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is buried .	-3.9023
The route is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday .	-3.3799
Previously , the investigators had previously used an archaeology and used it .	-6.8505
The Hund trained , specially trained for the smell of old human bones , together with his guide in the multi-males , was finally able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters .	-8.6621
In addition , together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Department of Monument Protection in the area of said road work , a ground anomaly was discovered .	-6.5564
Since more than one year , prosecutors and criminals have been working on the court for the misuse of crime .	-6.2981
Marxgrün has repeatedly been locked in a cycle path and investigated with sonars because the investigators suspect that this could have been squandered in the course of the rebuilding of the state road 30 years ago .	-8.7661
Colour powder and eggs : Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary anniversary	-2.9120
On Monday , the controversial referendum on independence in Catalonia is the first time .	-3.8909
But there are already crashes .	-5.4194
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the autumn of 2017 .	-2.9931
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017 , it came to the centre of Barcelona to clash between separatists and the police .	-3.1638
Catalan security forces were attacked by the pro-independence activists , including paint powders , when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard .	-6.0883
Around 3000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their counterparts , who were illegally admitted last year in the referendum in the local elections .	-6.4316
In trying to prevent citizens from voting , it was also the result of violence at the time .	-5.1398
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central-state security forces separate , reported Spanish media .	-3.7041
Some of the approximately 6000 separatists would then have tried to break the police chain , and the officials , among other things , use paint bags and eggs .	-5.9485
Six people have been arrested , 24 others have been slightly injured , and there has been an appeal to the authorities .	-5.1182
On Monday , for the first time , the independence referendum will take place .	-3.9552
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain , the central government in Madrid , Catalonia , in autumn 2017 , had been forced to rule .	-6.2354
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont flew to exile to Belgium .	-6.7219
Other politicians , too , turned abroad .	-4.1771
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement , on the other hand , continue to be in U-.	-4.0895
In December , new elections were held in the region .	-1.7162
Following the inauguration of the new Catalan Government in May , forced government was brought to an end .	-4.4395
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the right to self-determination of the Catalans .	-4.4394
Football : Oberliga Westfalen : Versammelte Ratlosigkeit : FC Gütersloh und RW Ahlen trennen sich torlos los	-2.3452
Red White Ahlen will continue on the spot .	-4.2679
At FC Gütersloh , too , there was only one thing : 0 : 0 unresolved .	-6.1712
The final light and the third final puppets they gathered before 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as a collectible dewaldstadion .	-7.2209
The first half was overlooked by the entertainment factor .	-2.8709
If you would prefer to get a beer or a bratwurst , you could do so .	-6.1844
There was no danger of missing a torchance because there was practically no .	-4.2171
First shot after half an hour	-1.1238
For the first ( harmless ) Torschuss of the whole lot called Güterslohs Nick Flock in the 28th minute .	-4.8372
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility had the Ahlener , as Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes with a shot of the penal area from a paradox .	-5.4597
The hosts were even harmless .	-2.9138
Their most effective action consisted of an early change .	-3.3659
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged for injury , for him came to Sinan Aygün .	-3.9201
After the change , both teams decided to do something against the increasingly emerging boredom .	-3.8834
In the 48-minute target Sebastian Mützel came out of 18 meters above the housing and after an hour the freight sloher appeared for the first time .	-7.8598
After a balloon conquest of Matthäus Wieckowicz it went fix .	-2.9183
The swift presentation of Konter about Sinan Aygün " crowned " Nick Flock ( 62nd ) with a glass shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann .	-6.4300
They also laid a head ball from Wieckowicz ( 66th ) to a corner ball of the ex-Ahleners Tim Manstein .	-4.7728
RWA-Interimstrainer Angelo Daut reacted , first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy ( 60. ) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel ( 70. ) .	-3.7015
It did not work .	-2.6646
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative , the Ahlener did not materialize .	-4.3160
Only in the 91st minute had Cihan Yilmaz the last chance , but also the brought nothing .	-4.2000
Angelo Daut tried to remove the positive : " It pleases me that we played zero , " but unfortunately the zero was also at the front .	-8.5883
" We were not as dangerous this time as we were against wood wrapping and even though our opponent had no desire to play here , " said RW Ahlens Interimstrainer .	-6.6241
Apparently , " everything went so a bit " against a team , " which only wanted to defend .	-7.1841
In any case , I did not feel that we could get a counter-war ' , so Daut .	-4.2341
But he had no sense of being a spectator , but his team could shoot a gateway .	-7.5281
That was too meagre to the idea .	-3.4371
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt : Fortunately , there are enough chalk mers .	-3.0322
The Brigitte Ransmann , Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler of the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle , for which these donations are destined .	-4.0746
The honorary official assurance : " These donations remain in the Reckenfeld " .	-8.2429
At the opening , the sky showed bright blue , but the place was still empty , but that should change over the course of the day .	-10.4918
Because : " Here it is so nice to socialise , so we are here today , " said a visitor .	-5.1556
The organiser of the Festes Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper priest Humor .	-4.3222
For the spouse Brockmann , which should actually be woven against food , sprangen short-term Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer .	-5.7041
The Verena ( daughter of Ferdi Kreimer ) has become ill .	-1.9118
But there is enough chalk .	-1.9377
And the " replacement " let it not take to entertain more and more visitors by musically .	-6.4365
This was so good that some folk songs were sung later .	-5.2668
" Just great " , joyous Marcel Kreimer .	-3.8685
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to sign the opening date of this time in his schedule .	-4.7565
He is pleased with the many active players with their booths , including mostly clubs .	-4.7373
" Actually , there should be something like a cube not giving " , he thanked for the action of the male choir .	-6.0377
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those who were in use at the stands and also completed the other ones in September and the Clean up action .	-7.1262
Our garden town has a colourful touch - what is at stake here .	-6.3336
Then the Maikranz was brought down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and the winter quartier .	-5.1937
Many booths have been worked for the sake of the . , , , , , .	-8.0041
From sweet to heart everything was to have .	-2.9108
Stefan Hagemeyer , who has been living in Reckenfeld for a year , was creative in his decorative sacred .	-5.5612
Furniwork , Bierdeckel with Reckenfelder Motiven and a lot more had to offer in the offer .	-8.8070
A speciality offered three reckenfelder Imker : " Reckenfelder Honig " , brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka , Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter .	-3.6878
The latter still has a speciality .	-3.7919
Honey cake in glass , of course with honey from my own production .	-2.4572
Because the little Elsa had to access again and again , so well covered the cake .	-6.1503
The sociability is that the visitors then spend a long time in the evening , even without a stage program that did not exist at the autumn festival .	-9.6419
Schmierereien mit lokalpolitischer Botschaft : No successful advertising for Skateanlage	-3.1741
In Lengerich , unknown people have scarcely promoted the construction of a skateplant .	-6.0638
In several places there are corresponding lubricants , Jürgen Kohne says of the city administration on request of the WN .	-6.4382
In at least one case , the police have been accused of being insulting .	-6.1456
In large letters on signs , among other things , on the Gempt-Halle and on the Old Town Hall the three words " Skatepark for Lengerich ! " .	-5.8694
Michael Rottmann , manager of the hall , reports that after the trade fair on 19 September , a correspondingly correspondingly moved to the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro was discovered .	-7.9408
Since the short message at the time appears to have been ' only ' left with Edding , it can be removed without any problems .	-7.3891
" A few days later , this was the case again , as this time sprayed " , so Rottmann .	-8.1989
It assumes that the appropriate advertising shield must be replaced .	-3.4427
A special note is given precisely this case by the fact that several large companies are also called from Lengerich . are . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.8534
If the Skateanlage is to be built , its realization should also be made possible by sponsors .	-5.4069
Promises already exist , explained Jörg Hesselmann from the urban field of education , sport and culture without name .	-5.1118
It is possible , however , that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that stand on the coated table .	-5.4299
For years local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateng .	-5.4593
After the old LWL clinic had been dismantled , after some time the search started after an alternative location .	-4.9868
The Council finally advocated a majority in favour of fire-fighters .	-5.0814
This effort has not been put in place - too many factors seem to be opposed to the construction of this site .	-7.2232

On a table , German society , at the cat table , is the migrants of the first generation .	-5.0161
Their children are growing up in Germany and want to be on the table .	-4.2209
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany , they have always sat at the big table and want to be involved .	-5.4422
That leads to conflict .	-2.5524

Initially rather behave , then he always rains the discussion round .	-5.8424
And there is a need for speech .	-2.6912
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective , two teachers tell how they see successful or not successful integration with students .	-4.2531
El-Mafaalani is not on stage , a symbol of the discussion : it is on an equal footing .	-4.4985
The sociology professor urges his opinion not to stress that he speaks of the average , not of individual fates .	-4.5253
He is pleased that there is an interest in the subject , because ' only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions ' , says El-Mafaalani .	-3.7808
Also during the subsequent signing hour , he still has an open ear for the questions of guests and also in the foyer was discussed intensively at prepared Kurdish specialities .	-7.3532

For the third time not in the start eleven : nevertheless , Naldo is thanking for Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco .	-6.5232
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf , but on the exchange bank had sat , the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two meters big Brazilians had been so right to the frustration of the soul .	-15.5579
But as the Schalker player after the 1 : 0-victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle , and he trained Domenico Tedesco at all his professionals , the 36-year-olds , called the simplest half Naldo , and said ; " We have to thank trainers , trainers ! "	-7.7006
" This was very emotional , that was great sport , " said Tedesco later about the reaction his vice-captain , who , despite his renewed reserve existence , had no resurgence .	-6.5855
Probably lích knows Naldo , who was celebrated in the last season as the best songwriter , that he is not in fact on his trainer - but is given a break for good reasons .	-8.8327
A reason called " load control " .	-2.5675
It was not easy to tell him that .	-2.6838
" It was not easy to tell him that I tell you quite honestly , " Tedesco reported from the moment when he said Naldo that he was not in the start eleven .	-4.4327
He is an important player , he is an important person .	-1.7637
