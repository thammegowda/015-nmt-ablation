In the Chancellor ’ s Office , the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had shifted a T-shirt with the Turkish and German label " Freedom for Journalists " and went into the front line .	-6.3078
The T-shirt , had not been the problem , Seibert said the picture on Sunday .	-1.7453
It was about disrupting the process of the press conference .	-3.2060
The action of the journalist gave rise to a great deal of unrest , which is unacceptable .	-4.6091
He has therefore led to the protection of the man .	-6.3693
Seibert said that it is not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery .	-3.2355
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not .	-3.4390

Munich : Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller	-2.2962
His fans usually know him as fresh and good , Florian David Fitz .	-3.8167
We have to look at twice : yes , that is really Florian David Fitz .	-3.6450
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night !	-2.1819
Hamburg - The Talkshow " Inas Nacht " produced by the NDR is known for humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe " Schellfischposten " .	-4.5233
Moderator Ina Müller encounters with her guests on a variety of beer , some wine or even more alcoholic drinks to relax the mood and tongues .	-6.7457
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for compulsory singing .	-5.3423
On Friday , another episode of the popular talk show was recorded .	-2.9891
This time : The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as " Men 's Hearts " , " Terror - Your verdict " or " The Strange Day " .	-5.4053
The Munich trip to the high north was not good at all .	-4.9887
On Saturday he postposta Selfie - his face is completely broken , his eyes only two small slices .	-6.1051
The bed-fie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz .	-3.9298
But he is not sick , he has only a powerful cat .	-2.5100
To his fans , he postulated some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now gained : " Rule one : goes NIE to Inas night .	-6.1098
Rule two : never drink the black sau .	-2.2376
And Spritz .	-1.6675
And the round of Eierlicör , which melts by half three , also leave away .	-5.5577
Alcohol consumption is actually written in the face of the 43-year-old .	-3.8235
His fans posted a few tips to combat the aftermath .	-4.6926
They range from instant breaks , fish crumbs or - probably the most effective - headache tablets .	-5.9144
Others simply enjoy the sight of the normally attractive cinema .	-4.0713
How Ina Müller survived the night suction camp is not known .	-4.7088
As she has moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007 , the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested ...	-4.8148
On a beer with Ina Müller .	-1.0863
Treysa has to Combating Vandalism and Unrat	-10.9679
It is difficult to find and tired .	-3.9796
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought , but solutions are scarcely emerging .	-4.0884
Scherben , cigarette dumps , rubbish and rubbish , demolished dustbin and now dismantled signs - this has been the starting point for a long time .	-7.5080
For the exemplary project of Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland offers a more than dishonest sight .	-6.3135
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC community of Schwalmstadt but others have also been working for a longer time , according to the cyclist of Ulrich Wüstenhagen .	-7.6570
The problem has already been raised in the wheel transport council .	-4.3627
There has been no solution .	-2.8946
The proposals range from the transfer of seats to regular discharges of waste containers and cleaning of the land at the entrance point .	-6.3572
" I think the latter would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities , " says Wüstenhagen .	-4.2378
Guido Hahn ( ADFC ) reports that they have also introduced the topic into the local advisory council .	-4.4089
Not only does the rubbish drive around cyclists and residents - the seat group is a regular meeting place on weekends .	-5.8599
It is not only often too loud , but the joints are also destroyed : posts are torn out of the earth , garbage bin demolished , shields are buried , shielded and seat furniture .	-11.3113
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often , said ADFC member Susanne Klippert .	-3.5977
However , the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean .	-2.4894
You are annoyed that the Rastplatz on the bicycle path in Treysa is a meeting point for suction camps .	-6.6871
" Along the entire cycle path there is a clear focus here on the Haaße-Hill " , confirms the cyclist , who is now also concerned about the new cycle center in goat hain , which is being opened today .	-8.9746
'If it makes the same fate , it becomes quite expensive ' .	-4.6655
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill : " Perhaps that will set the threshold is much higher than the threshold of interfering with common good .	-8.3562
This would , however , require a police action to pass in time .	-6.1025
In principle , Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße-hill .	-3.8128
It must be made more attractive .	-1.0188
The frequency of the cycling path can be very satisfied .	-4.8939
The marketing of tourism is still able to expand .	-4.1117
Our cycle path is very high compared to others in Germany , " says the ADFC members .	-3.9789
ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in Ascheröder Street in Treysa .	-3.3913
There is no bike ride on the Haaße Hill .	-3.6297
If there is a lot of traffic , cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of traffic flow , " she explains .	-6.1321
This is not a problem for sporty drivers , but it is for older people and especially children .	-4.3298
Music Contest at the Culture Station : The " Kö von Hiltrup " and the lake .	-3.4536
The first call to the music contest was a success , creative and co-existence .	-3.1427
" D a song for Hiltrup " is the appeal of Hiltrup " is the appeal of Hiltrup " in the " Musikcontest for big and small , young and experienced musicians " .	-5.4699
A Contest " with a joke in the sympathetic Hiltruper family " , as Karl Franke put it .	-4.6144
In fact , it was soon a family relationship with coffee and cakes from the Ministry of Culture .	-5.6868
Seven formations began , from the one-man band to the big ensemble : Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied , Henk Humberg with guitar , Rolf Ihmig , a long-lived albachtener living in Hiltrup , the Nine of the Hiltruper Star Colors , three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families , an ensemble from the Lummerland Kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and Zwarties .	-5.6823
This contest , said district mayor Joachim Schmidt , said , is a novelty .	-3.2227
We have not seen this in other parts of the city .	-2.2010
What did the Texters link ?	-4.7975
The towns of Hiltruper Lake and the market allee were particularly frequent .	-5.5311
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue to the " Kö von Hiltrup " in his striking song .	-4.2359
The cultural station was also appreciated .	-3.6463
Time and again it was about experiencing coexistence in these places , especially Alvin Jasic .	-4.5340
Karl Franke animated the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints on their work .	-5.9677
He learned from Humberg that he had studied chemistry , but now teaching guitar .	-5.3969
Franke was able to report by the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann that the recently occurred in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest .	-6.3045
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on Youtube .	-2.6542
" It is not about winning , " Franke said .	-2.2739
In fact , all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy .	-2.0908
There was something special for the jury ’ s favourites – so that others can listen to their songs .	-4.7672
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann .	-2.0553
Other musicians can record a song : He with his Hiltrup drummer , who impressed Franke especially with his musicality , and the " Lummerland-Rudel " : " a very beautiful performance " with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon , Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle .	-5.4811
Like all the children came up again for the finals - and even sounded " well " without electronic support , as Franke said .	-6.8174
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality , reference to Hiltrup , the intimacy of the melody and recognition value .	-4.1195
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik , Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from Wirtschaftsverbund and Jan Kaven , Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive .	-3.5252
The city ’ s offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence .	-5.4049
She valued the event as a full success .	-2.9977
All are " very satisfied " , and " the atmosphere was good " in the soon very full cultural station .	-3.8541
The word game : Decrypto in the Game etest	-3.1065
The players form two teams facing each other .	-3.1639
For each page there is a screen , there are four cards with keywords , which can be digitized - the old trick with the red foil - if you have inserted them .	-7.7957
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything .	-4.6712
On the maps , for example , you can read from left to right : " 1st Renaissance . . in . in . in . in . in , , , . ,	-12.2977
2 .	-1.6184
3 .	-1.2280
4 . '	-0.9982
These are the terms that must be encrypted .	-10.5804
This is because it is not the terms but codes .	-4.2841
One player per team is the encoder .	-3.3181
He gets a code card that may be " 3.4.2 " .	-3.2691
In " Decrypto " not the terms behind the secret film , but their encryption codes .	-4.0725
His task in this case : he should describe - in this order and in this example - describe the terms " dice " , " feast " and " windows " - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team if he succeeds in cracking the code twice .	-6.9608
So the encoder notes and reads loudly : " throwing " for the dice , " Lose " as a contrast to feast ; here something like " party " would be possible and " Prague " because he watched in school and knows the window curz there .	-8.2954
This is the way round for round , team for team .	-4.9699

Heide Keller ( 76 ) famous , but on January 1 , 2018 she went off board forever .	-4.2058

Croatia ’ s vice-champion Rebic was almost involved in every dangerous offensive by the Hessen and never managed to get control of Hanover .	-6.0403
The protracted storms long after the World Cup showed why it is so valuable for harmony .	-6.6088
In addition to Rebic , the Brazilian Allan , who was born from FC Liverpool , was the first time in the early formation of Frankfurt , which began swi.	-8.1593
Lucas Torró ( 17 ) , which was deposited on the Tor network , brought danger for the first time .	-8.1857

Leaders fell almost inevitable and entirely deserved .	-9.7832
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defensive corner into the penal area , Haller extended per head in front of the gate , where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot .	-6.9937
It was the first Bundesliga meeting for the defensive player won by the French second league , AJ Auxerre in . . , , , , . in . , , , in .	-13.3581

In the mid-term , Hannover-Coach Breitenreiterated the weak performance of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt .	-4.1909

The Hesses were much more efficient .	-3.0773
After a short hour , Rebic started a solo and then put across De Guzmán , who only had to push the ball into the empty goal .	-5.2430

It has not been finished to this day , but only the altar is standing , the missing long-house is indicated by the trees .	-8.4492

After the scaffolding for some time , the damage could be more accurately identified and the individual tenders were prepared to be more specific .	-7.1272
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned , because the damage already existed a few years ago , but more has also been discovered , which has only been made possible by using scaffolding .	-7.7429
The socket plaster work has been completed , the natural stone works are to be started before winter and one hopes to finish half of this year .	-7.3080

Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account broader corridors , corridors and doors , larger rooms and accessible access for all areas .	-5.7323
The first plans began around eight years ago , when the former U.S. Army officer building was tested for the residents with Handycap : " The house had come into the years and no longer in the equipment , " said Bader retrospectively .	-6.0369
In 2016 , the excavators moved to tear the house .	-3.6122
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it , according to the architect .	-4.7385

The Managing Director of Lebenshilfe , Jürgen Heinz .	-3.6904
The spagate between a barrier free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy .	-4.3804
However , the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many presets that would allow the inhabitants to be able to move without foreign help .	-7.9800
In the same way , Gertrud Kreutmayer , said : " The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants who need tools to be mobile " .	-5.5710
The combination of living and functionality were well combined , said Kreutmayer .	-4.2689
And again : " The property in this situation is a real happiness because it is no longer to be acquired in the current situation ' .	-6.7775

Germany : Sweetly laments differences between East and West	-3.0802
Berlin - Before the day of unity , the deputy president of the SPD , Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germany .	-9.6365
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity .	-2.3303
We must not be satisfied with these differences , " said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern " on Sunday " .	-4.1616
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country .	-2.7189
It is unacceptable for East German to work longer on average than the people in West Germany , but they should receive 15 % less .	-12.7170
" I cannot explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity , " said Schwesig .	-2.9362
North Korea : Does this putty dog end the Korean conflict ?	-2.4018

As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday , the two dogs reached their recipients on Thursday .	-3.6670
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to ' facilitate reconciliation ' .	-5.3820
The dogs with the thick white coat , sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent .	-3.1987
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .	-2.0006
The North announced the goodwill at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang in mid-September .	-3.7623

What is Austria ?	-0.2784
The 100th anniversary of the Republic , which has been celebrated in this commemoration for almost ten months now , numerous new books have been published , which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years .	-6.7251

New Week , New Opportunity for the Government	-1.5039
Returning to the material work , this is the unofficial motto of the grand coalition ’ s working week .	-5.3810
Hardly an interview , hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU , SPD and also from the CSU have recently summed up the " return to work " .	-6.1766
This may have led some craftsmen , doctors , casierers and other working citizens in that country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and material work , but it is .	-7.0112
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its mandate - governance - it should not be discouraged by debate about concepts .	-6.5639
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and blasphemy of recent weeks will probably be shown on Monday .	-7.1705
In the evening , the leaders of the governing parties gather together for the coalition committee .	-3.6332
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round to defuse conflicts early ; a lesson from all the dispute .	-3.7002
First , however , conflict-related issues are again on the agenda with diesel retrofitting and the law on law on immigration .	-6.5872
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange-premiums , SPD and CDU see manufacturers in an obligation to upgrade older diesel .	-6.5403
While there has been an approximation in the diesel crisis throughout the weekend , the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned specialist immigration law .	-6.1424
The SPD calls for a lead view for rejected asylum seekers who work or are training .	-5.0317
The Union is strongly opposed to ' change of track ' from the asylum system into the labour market .	-2.4822
So there will be disputes between the coalition partners - and how should it be different ?	-3.5654
It is not equal and equal to GroKo , but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities .	-5.5429
Dispute is good .	-2.2810
Without a dispute , a society characterised by such diverse interests , sometimes contradictory interests does not make progress .	-4.7336
In order to be constructive , however , disputes must not be reopened for partisan tactical reasons .	-5.0558
It is still about politics , not theatre .	-2.5943
The Union and the SPD should argue , but always look at the real life of the people .	-5.7617
What is feasible and benefits many ?	-2.1476
This key issue can be addressed pragmatically to clarify both the diesel and track change issues - and thus regain confidence .	-6.7073
That is what the grassroots parties must fight now .	-4.8837

Is the Labour Minister of Labour against the current law of service ?	-5.0557
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at this more closely .	-2.0704
" Really day and night " their legists had worked on social security reform , a superfluous social minister reported at the presentation of the same two weeks ago .	-6.3947
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger , the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein ( FPÖ ) comes as a surprise - she brings the matter to Parliament via request .	-5.2325
She assumes that ' the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the commitment of her team and not to declare infringements of current service law in front of cameras ' .	-7.9476
Nevertheless , they now have questions to be able to " free " from any suspicion " .	-5.9860

The route is closed until Monday in the Marxgrün area .	-4.0175
It was predicted that the investigators had previously used an archaeology store .	-5.8880
The dog , especially trained for the smell of old human bones , was able to limit the relevant place to a few metres .	-6.0617

For more than a year , Public Prosecutor 's Office and Criminal Police Court have been working on the missing case .	-5.1581
A cycle path has been closed at Marxgrün and investigated with sonars , because the investigators suspect that Heike 's body might have been tended here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago .	-15.7245

But riots are already taking place .	-3.2288
The separatists did not forget the police operation of the autumn of 2017 .	-2.7587
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1 , 2017 , clashes between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona .	-3.3702
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates , among other things , in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard .	-4.9300
Some 3,000 officials from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year in the polling stations that were considered illegal .	-6.8334
In trying to prevent citizens from voting , there was also violence at that time . .	-11.2880
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces separate , reported Spanish media .	-2.7821
However , some of the 6000 separatists would then have been using force to break the police chain and put the officials with colour bags and eggs .	-5.9236
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured , they were told by the authorities .	-5.5535
On Monday , the first anniversary of the independence referendum .	-2.0572
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain , the central government in Madrid imposed Catalonia in the fall of 2017 .	-3.1614
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium .	-1.9023

Football : Oberliga Westfalen : Versammelte Inciency : FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen Separate Torlos	-5.7829
Red and white Ahlen is still on the spot .	-4.5544
At the FC Gütersloh , too , it was only a 0 : 0 draw .	-5.2543
In front of 438 viewers in Heidewaldstadion , the final light and the third last showed them as a conquered impunity .	-9.2469
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor .	-13.8013
Those who would prefer to get a beer or a bratwurst could do this safely .	-5.5779
There was no risk of missing a chance , because there was virtually none .	-3.8852
First Shot after half an hour	-1.6300
Nick Flock was responsible for the first ( harmless ) kick of the entire game .	-5.2273
The best - and in principle even true - possibility was the Ahlener when Cihan Yilmaz FCG Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the ceiling .	-5.3767
The hosts were even more harmless .	-1.7380
Their most effective action was an early change .	-2.9137
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged , for him Sinan Aygün .	-3.8468
After the change , both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom .	-14.5815
In the 48th minute Sebastian Motzel of 18 metres just above the housing and after an hour the freight sloters also appeared offensive for the first time .	-8.0334
After a conquest of Matthaew Wieckowicz , it was fixed .	-3.0417

In addition , they performed with a headball from Wieckowicz ( 66th ) after a pitch of former Ahlener Tim Manstein .	-4.7856
RWA Interimstrainer Angelo Daut , first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy ( 60 ) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Motzel ( 70 ) .	-3.1557
It did - nothing .	-1.7955
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative , the Ahlener did not come about .	-3.8501
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance , but neither did it .	-4.3836
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive : " I like we played to zero " , but unfortunately the zero was also at the front .	-6.7571
" This time we were not as torthreatening as we were against woodwrapping and that although our opponent had no desire to play here , " RW Ahlens Interimstrainer .	-7.1787
Offensive " everything so called a bit " against a team that only wanted to defend .	-5.0951
In any case , I did not feel that we could get another door , " says Daut .	-3.9937

" This is so nice sociable here , so we are here today , " said a visitor .	-4.6666
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit with a proper prise of humor .	-5.0089
For the couple Brockmann , who was supposed to be weighed against food , Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in short term .	-11.3236
The Verena ( daughter of Ferdi Kreimer ) has become sick .	-2.1453
But there are enough chalets .	-2.2824
And the " replacement " could not be taken to entertain the ever growing visitors in the meantime .	-6.4828
This was so good that at late hour some folk songs were sung .	-4.9308
" Simply great " , Marcel Kreimer enjoyed .	-2.9348
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule .	-3.1669

Blacksmithing shops with a local message : no successful advertising for skateboarding installations . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-12.7085
In Lengerich , unknown unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate plant in Lengerich .	-4.6808
In several places there are appropriate lubricants , says Jürgen Kohne from the City Administration on request of WN .	-4.7120
In at least one case , the police have been prosecuted for material damage .	-5.0227
In large letters , the three words " Skatepark for Lengerich ! " on signs , among others , the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall .	-5.0278
Michael Rottmann , Manager of the hall , reports that a corresponding font had been discovered on the advertising sign on the staircase at the staircase of the Gempt-Bistro .	-5.9793
Since the short message was apparently " only " with an Edding , it was possible to remove it easily .	-5.8905
" A few days later this was there again , this time sprayed " , says Rottmann .	-5.5194
He assumes that the relevant advertising sign must be replaced .	-3.5200
A special note is given precisely this case by the fact that several large firms from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table .	-6.2786
If the skatepark is built , the realization of this project will also be made possible by sponsors .	-5.7334
Promises are already made , explained Jörg Hesselmann of the urban field of school , sport and culture , without name .	-12.3736
Well possible , however , that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the covered table .	-5.3816
Local policy and administration have been dealing with skating equipment for years .	-4.3216
After the old at the LWL clinic , the search for an alternative location began after some time .	-4.1350
The majority of the Council was in favour of fire-fighting parking .	-4.5720
However , this idea was not implemented - too many factors seem to have spoken against building at this point .	-5.0406
At the end of June , a U-turn followed .	-2.7310
The members of the main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area .	-12.0196
Jürgen Kohne says the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning .	-4.7001

It is based on a decision this year , so that a positive vote could be built in 2019 .	-3.5959
Bottdown on Air Traffic Making Worse	-6.0304
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer , German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year .	-3.0469
" This year we had wind , 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm , " said the chief of the trade union of Air Security , Matthias Maas , the German press agency before the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg .	-4.9253
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known staffing difficulties in European air traffic controllers , for which there is no quick solution .	-6.0363
" Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year , but the training of new pilots takes four to five years , " said the trade unionist .	-3.5005
Across Europe , the market for ready trained pilots is empty .	-3.8929
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace .	-3.3058
Maas once again criticised the fact that various air trade unions were not invited to the summit .	-3.2897
On Friday , representatives of the federal , the countries , air traffic control , airlines and airports gather in the Hanseatic City to address the causes of delays .	-5.1858
" If you want to talk about additional compression and overtime , this will not be done without us , " explained the head of the GdF , who has many members at the German Air Security Council .	-7.0052
Maas was once again responsible for the pilotage misery .	-5.0217
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low .	-3.0836
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings in national air traffic control are now fully focused on operational business .	-5.6902
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer ( CSU ) to work in Brussels for regulations that " do not keep air traffic control .	-6.1108
At present , EU requirements would be voted by 2024 and there would be further tightening .	-4.3684
The EU has been subjected to constant pressure from airlines .	-2.9308
" Ryanair boss Michael O 'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years , " said Maas .	-3.3633
He hopes that the high delays in the airlines will lead to a rethink .	-5.0374
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if German Air Traffic Control ( DFS ) offer a " coherent training and future pact " , said Maas said . .	-13.6907
The recording of 120 piloters per year over the next five years , which has been announced to date , is enough to compensate for age-related outages .	-8.2259
The necessary staffing is not yet associated with this .	-3.7314
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group Renewal	-10.2148
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the restructuring plans .	-2.4979
According to the wishes of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff , who was appointed Chairman of the Board at Sunday 's meeting , the crisis is to be split into two independent companies .	-4.7063
Both companies should be based in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange .	-3.1475
There should be no additional reduction in staff than already known cuts in administration .	-4.9043
After two resignations , the control body counts only eight heads on the capital side .	-2.7178
