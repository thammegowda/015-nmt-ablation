In order to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .	-8.1725
A Horde of BootsLiberty-owned beekeepers would have done him if he had done it .	-5.1446
But it is important that it has been attributed , especially to the importance that it was attributed to Emma Lazarus of Gedicus in 1903 , after 17 , the and .	-11.5549
As Miller Acosta said : " I don 't want to go into a complete story about Ding , but the statue of freedom is a symbol of American freedom .	-7.5739
The poem , which you refer to the original part , was not added later , and the statue of liberty .	-11.7060
Miller is right , but it is true , as he himself said , it is not really about history .	-6.1228
It is about the contemporary resonance of resonance to the words of Lazarus , which invites the only state in which a single state does not invite you to the poor , but the poor , the poor , the people of your poor , the mass of your people , the poor , the people who are free to breathe .	-15.8821
There has never been a time when the " waste " in our screen .	-5.0717
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-5.1469
This conflict is important because of a statue of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict in America .	-5.1445
Lazarus - friends and their friends to put their words on the basis of their death , after their death - knew very well that they had a very good political action .	-7.6717
The sculpture should show links between French and American Republicanism by showing them in a classic portrayal of freedom .	-6.2117
Lazarus changed this meaning : In her poem is no longer abstract figure - she has received a voice .	-4.4171
And there is a very different name : Mother Exilators .	-5.2024

The United States is not supposed to learn the path in the United States .	-5.4751
Ziemwnlich is unusual in Limbaugh .	-7.0298
The importance of statue is quite a question of the position and the perception of the position .	-5.7754
The great fantasy of Lazarus , indeed , was to see them as they were , as they had exhausted , but hopeful , hopeful and often dreadful journeys on ships .	-10.7423
It is in the true sense of the world to look for people from the perspective of the people who seek refuge and improve their lives .	-6.8690
Their statue speaks to them and the hope of the words of the will to hear them .	-8.7594
And that is not , of course , the Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge .	-4.6734
Their torch is not the way to learn , but hatred , the only source of power .	-6.6286

The father of our country knew something worse .	-2.5204
The Americans loved George Washington , but it took too long to swallow him to swallow him to swallow him to pursue his political principles .	-7.5032
He sent him to the criticism .	-7.6269
But he has not brought his critics to silence .	-2.2347
In 1783 , Washington said : " The freedom of speech can be taken away , and stupid - and we will be stumbled to the slaughter .	-13.2684
This brings me to Maryland Gouverneur to Larry Hogan , who has to work more .	-3.5092
Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people , and their opinion on the official side of the Facebook page .	-10.3658
And the American Civil Liberties Union from the beginning of this week .	-3.5279
The Stab Gouverns of your classmates , and the online commentary as a commentary , was full of feedback from the " Na Na " .	-11.2778
" It is just " Facebook , many people said .	-2.0297
But it is important .	-0.5455
And it is particularly important if a type like Hogan .	-2.6264
This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state , .	-3.1241
He has the second highest approval of the governors of the nation .	-3.9083
Hogan is not a reactionary hits .	-2.2291
He has shown a firm hand in hand and strict compliance with the principles of the state .	-4.3798
He was also very sent to Facebook as a primary tool to connect to his voters and to his voters with his head .	-8.4962
That is why the blockage of people who come on the side of the Gouverns - is a public forum that is officially called the forum and is paid by people who are paid unnecessarily and dangerous .	-9.8365
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogans Speaker in Amelia Chauan , the governor of the Chauverns , argued that nothing more than moderation .	-6.2148
But it is easy to use the image of Trolls or spammers , or people who use the peer online peer .	-10.0923
The post spoke with some real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-3.1909
And that is only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a parish , a troika and no troll .	-7.3963
They all said that their comments were respectful , not thoughtful and profane .	-4.3171

" I commented that politely was disappointed that there was no response to hatred and other news stories " , " she wrote in the news section .	-7.7513
" I do not appreciate this idea , even if a number of people will take a position on the same subject as some of them , rather than a collective use of so-called ' collective disregard for the citizens concerned .	-9.8177
What the employees of Gouverns called the " Spam-focused attack " would probably call others .	-6.8082
The Facebook-era era simply makes it easy to cut a message by criticizing critics or negatively block a comment .	-5.8076
It is far too early to be cleaner than when you have done the same thing that the employees had been sent to newspapers to collect critical papers and to collect protesters and to silence demonstrators or demonstrators .	-10.7005
But that is precisely what is happening .	-3.8412

At the time of Washington , the time of affordable Portingos had a similar impact on the Internet .	-4.6146

Under the latter it is their publisher and inspiration from Riodocator , Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-5.6418
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico , and journalist Valdez wrote his books on a number of books in a context of violence .	-5.5690
His absence is deep , even though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows the word ' Justice finger ' on the facade of the building .	-7.5055

In Riodoce , they are still insisting on the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are unthinkable and now the terrain is still intact .	-8.8145

Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition in the United States , Sinaloa in January has become one of the most bloodiest battles in the country , because the political groups have been struggling to fill the vacuum .	-7.3114
It makes no sense that , in Sinaloa , or someone on the streets of the street or the graveyard is full of the cemetery of the two-storeys that are larger than the royal drug for many living houses .	-13.1868
Forget a minute for a moment that there is a state of ' calm ' when there is only a cartel of control over the coastal state with its valuable trade routes and the United States .	-10.2436
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , who was unable to protect his friend .	-5.6506
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to murder .	-8.6276
First of all , there was the publication of a interviews with Damaso Lopez , a leader of a rival cartel in the Guzman ’ s war with Söhnen .	-5.9697
This publication may have been delayed by the sons of Gangmar , suspected each edition of the purchase of each edition as soon as they have been delivered .	-9.5404

He voluntarily admitted that he had fear .	-2.3414
" I want to continue living " , he said JCP-award .	-4.2623
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a ' lifestyle ' , said in October last interview with a TV interview .	-5.1731
" You must take over the task you have to play as a journalist or journalist - either you play .	-12.6114
I do not want to ask : ' What did you have done so many deaths ... why did you ?	-11.0510
The Riodoce-Team is missing , Valdez SpaSpvogel , a port worker like the port workers , a friend who was generous and generous , with advice and advice .	-9.5180
You trust your routine .	-3.3893
He would always wear his dog .	-1.7263
He would always go to El Guayabo Bar , opposite the office , and always sit on the same table .	-4.9486
Now they ask : Was his love to Routine his Ver?	-5.2745
His death also forced them to face up to their own assumptions about how best they can do their job and keep them alive .	-5.6574
" They do not like you , if women with their children , their homes , their clean shops , their start-ups and downs .	-8.4861
" These things were not allowed " , said Bojorquez .	-2.0342
The result is itself in the best times , a high degree of self-censorship and self-censorship .	-3.2122
His own instincts trust .	-3.7483

It is a history of survival and protest , and it is the love of the loss and strength of resistance , the strength of the people from the point of view of the community , the streets and the responses to the community .	-8.1822

" What has happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past ...	-4.0045

It must be a good thing to do , not only activism , but also the various layers of black and experience of the black constitution , and we must do to free ourselves .	-9.3002

According to Noel Sharitel , Professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR , we must begin to take their rise .	-4.1929
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its breast and the type of fingergel .	-4.8688
" The people are making them more funny , but they will deliver a lot of them , and we will see them more often , Mr Sharkey said in his new report .	-8.4664
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their partners to a robot with a silicone cone that develops warm , sensitive to human intelligence .	-8.9988
The user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions and choose everything from the eye color of the eye color of the robot of the breast or the type of fingernails .	-8.8198

Their emergence and increasing refinement in darkness , something more and more deep in our culture , an ideal retreat from gender equality to gender equality .	-16.0102
Most men will , of course , do not hold a robot , while the rising popularity of FRR , they remain curiously on the verge of consumption culture .	-8.7274

I am sure that this is a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that entails considerable risks .	-6.9188
The Left has been strengthened by Trump , but the effect of his presidency has strengthened us all to postpone the right .	-12.1766
If we talk about " normalization and Trump , we refer to the possibility of selgruent powers to us that one day will no longer be able to get away .	-8.8066

Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that the same people tolerate the same cells as most of us , and that most of us have supported us in our diary .	-6.4719

Particularly in the case of high emotionality , the punishment for pupils could be even more severe .	-7.5659
Nevertheless , unlike many other victims , many complain that humanity has sacrificed general assessments of humanity and , in many cases , despite violence and even positive memories .	-10.7423
In interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on Misssdal about the abuse of the Regensburger Domzinger , Georg Ratzin.	-7.8728
Mr Hesemann , the 440-sided side incidents over the " violence of thousands of victims of violence in the rainfall of the Domsfoen in Germany .	-9.9694
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity .	-5.9789
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholera and performer , he has been a performer when he has not been a performer .	-10.3925
How do you evaluate this biograph report ?	-3.2181
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and the whole 440 pages from the long front , you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg Ratzinger .	-15.3614
He is just about eight pages dedicated to him and his suspicion of sexual abuse or complicity in cases of sexual abuse .	-9.1019
The violence of texzesse also preview outside its sphere of action .	-6.1346
You may not be accustomed to accuse him of being too late or not .	-7.5621
The domain spasimnyasium , which was practically applied to all respondents , was literally " - as a " redemption " , " and " better world " .	-10.3586
Thus , the vast majority of his pupils , Georg Ratzinger , is an excellent testimony to him as a " warm , " warm , " sincere " and " well-understood " , " and " teacher " , " as well as the young teacher , who regularly praises the cake of the cake and bons of children .	-15.9790
Only a minority complained about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which also led to anger .	-6.9951
The fact that he has not only stools with stools and stools on the ground , but also on the ground , Ofregen and distributed all too often to the hair .	-14.1542
In his honor , however , it must be said that such recovery methods were disseminated in the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , when parents were widely disseminated .	-7.1824
Do you know more about such methods ?	-3.3115
Of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 .	-2.4292
I have also experienced a secular school , a Gymnasium .	-5.1064
Compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the abuse of sexual violence , abuse and abuse of the texzessen on the . , , , and , , , , , , , , , and . and , , , , , , , , , , and	-16.4992
As if one wonders whether it is not familiar with his role and his brother , Benedict XVIBenedict XVIs has just begun to do so .	-9.4369
On the Bavarian Papal work , many of whom have never understood him .	-6.0553
The truth , however , is : the report by Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-3.0149
In the media , the report was very much about the abuse of rainfall in the domain of Regensburg .	-6.0809
Will Georg Ratzinger be included in the final report or any reference to sexual abuse ?	-4.9488
Michael Hesemann : no .	-1.6802
No one of the victims of sexual assaults , claiming that Domkapellmeister has become familiar .	-6.3036
Not even parents were bored .	-3.1156
" I never dared to speak with my father , or my mother said about it , " I was a deputy for the other people who had been very embarrassed to me .	-14.1699
The real problem with the enlightenment of sexual abuse is that most victims .	-4.7368
If they were not even parents and siblings , then the choir will certainly not have been appointed , but the choir of the perpetrators .	-9.3248
How do the domain name rate for pupils in the Ratzingers ?	-6.5388
Michael Hesemann : A student questioned : " In so far as to sexual abuse ... I do not see a case in which case he would have been able to hold the interest rate ( timely and timely ) .	-12.3428
I also think it is absurd to assume that it is more important to him ...	-7.5934
It is inconceivable to talk about sex .	-5.8971
The result of the report is quite clear : ' The fact that it was possible for the pupils concerned and their environment , or the study was confirmed in the context of the investigation ' .	-12.9900
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger has been released by everyone .	-4.7973
Nor can it be accused of not being brought to him or her display .	-5.7438
That is why there is no good reason to oppose this crime in relation to external action , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-6.7285
In the media , much of " texzessen " was in the rainfall of the Domsburger Domatz.	-6.2398
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger report will look at the way forward .	-5.1900
Do he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.9797
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that reporting is missing and everything has been mixed up in a huge sexual abuse and misuse of force , somewhere in the middle of a texzezinger , Georg Ratdrin .	-8.9860
But this is precisely a misuse of the report .	-2.9562
Because the fact that there is a separate preview of the gymnasium and the abuse of sexual abuse between the texzessen and violence , we say once again .	-9.8458
In addition , the report deals with waste from 1945 , including four decades , Georg Ratzinger , Georg Domzinger , was not the head of the chorus .	-8.1817
The whole caning pedagogical , pedagogical cases where the knees of sadistic teachers have been rightly cited , and have suffered appalling and horrific conditions , including those that have suffered from the scandalous Eternal Pizhofen and .	-16.4872
But with those who had not had anything to do with Georg Domzinger , because he got the boy to do so until they were already on the face of Domyasimnasium .	-16.6713
On the subject , like most of the witnesses , the most taboo subject " preview " .	-6.1971
It was only happy to escape her and his genome so much better treatment for many " and even better treatment " .	-7.4068
What was different from that domain spasimnyasium ?	-4.3150
Michael Hesemann : Since there was no discipline but discipline , no sadistic violence .	-4.8158
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger , which is why the report concludes that many of the victims ' general humanity ' , despite many cases of violence and , in spite of many positive memories .	-8.7922
For example , at most , the accusation is still being built .	-8.7281
But , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported on the condition of .	-6.4596
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself as a predecessor of a school , and he was not responsible for the fact that he did not want to hear ( and then he ) . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-15.2739
Does Georg Ratzinger still remain consistent with the assurances ?	-5.9321
Michael Hesemann : No , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domyasimnasium , who even reproduce the report .	-3.7696
It points out that he says that the ' Prüm ' will continue to practice practice the caning ' .	-10.8208
In view of the risk of negative press releases , he recommended that he should intervene .	-6.0121
That was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was banned as a caning in Bavaria .	-4.5752
Davor Gragnor she knows , in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-7.5271
Since it was difficult to estimate him , where the affected or perhaps exaggerated dramatized and where the limit was actually exceeded .	-7.5764
However , it is not possible to say that he would always have looked away .	-7.3929
That is simply not true .	-2.1489
Only in 1980 , the caning was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-4.0957
Principality of Gloria Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards .	-10.9137
What do you see ?	-7.0459
Michael Hesemann : " We talk of historians " of Fallachronism " , that is , in other words , the moral hazard of the past .	-8.1301
Since the prince has already quite right .	-4.8850
But that does not apply to sexual abuse , of course , at all times , and this was not the case for the preview of the innocent and incitement violence in children ’ s seold-fashioned , which goes far beyond the usual . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-16.9384
This is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally working .	-3.6822
But at the same time , Georg Ratzinger has to do nothing to do with him .	-4.6725
His disciplines to discipline and punishment , therefore , Ohran , and the hair to the ears and ears were disseminated in 1970ies . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-13.7030
When physical punishment was banned , it was strictly forbidden .	-4.3073
What image of his Regensburger Zeit has given to you during his talks with Georg Ratzinger for the book " My brother " ?	-7.8667
Kam raised the issue of caning .	-4.5239
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about life , but the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict XVI .	-4.6218
Nevertheless , I am not in any way that he led a strict regime .	-7.4713
But it must also be said : Without this perfectionism , without calling for the discipline of unconditional discipline , it would not have been possible to do so until then , it would have been possible to create a true world heritage of Europe ’ s cultural ambassador ( 1987 ) and its musical tradition twice in 1991 and 1988 ( Japan ) .	-14.3987
With Keksen and Bonbons alone , it is now inconsistent with no big sawmill and every success in every area . , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-13.1812
When what do you have experienced people , since Georg Ratzinger talks with her book ?	-7.9424
