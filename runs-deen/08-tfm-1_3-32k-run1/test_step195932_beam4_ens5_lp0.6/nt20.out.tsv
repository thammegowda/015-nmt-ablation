Conundrum : That is why we cannot fool ourselves .	-5.0841
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from being able to chew themselves , as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments at rats , as they said on Thursday evening , and progress has also been made on the question of why children are so fiercely opposed to kite , only to demand more .	-10.3799
After all , it has also been shown why the sewing of a kitten hand is already causing laughter before touching , which is due to a deep layer in the large hirry that is already causing laughter when the kitten is expected .	-11.1355
According to previous research , rats with " laughter " in the ultrasound area were shown to be carved by people , and this " laughter " is conveyed by the part of the large brain drain which the central processing of haptic perception is carried out .	-8.5656
Lachen is suppressed during self-touch .	-2.7316
It was assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - that is , people cannot chew themselves , but Berlin researchers have now found out in the experiments at the rats that laughter , like the activity of the area in question , is suppressed during self-touch , even if living beings themselves plaster .	-11.0558
However , if the self-touch and touch are suppressed by others at the same time , the laughter is also suppressed , suggesting that the brain of the rats cannot distinguish between self-touch and touch by others .	-8.7835
In addition , the rats have been trained to chew themselves , so they sometimes broke this initiation in the experiment prematurely , showed escape behaviour or horror .	-10.7330

The UN General Debate did not resolve the Iran conflict , but now there is a problem less : the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " , held in Iran , could be back at sea , a puzzle door in the Iranian President Ruhani 's peace plan .	-7.0878
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " , which has been stuck in Iran since mid-July , is back in international waters .	-8.4331
The " Stena Impero " have left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now travelling to Dubai for medical examinations , said Chief Executive Erik Hånell .	-6.7031

" This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas , and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law , " said a communication on Friday .	-6.2761

The British Government suspected , behind the establishment of the Stena Impero , a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar : in early July , a supertanker with oil from Iran intended for Syria was placed on the chain , according to the authorities , against EU sanctions against Syria , which the British had received from the United States .	-7.9601

India has a better future with its protectionist economic policies .	-2.7062
India would actually be predestined to be the " war profiter " , but , given the tariffs imposed by America 's President Donald Trump against Chinese manufacturers , foreign producers in the People 's Republic are forced to rescind , with financial chefs of Asian firms considering relocating their production from China to another country , India appears to be one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey , which , of course , has not only done with the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war .	-9.9735
But now India itself is in Trump ’ s focus , devaluing from the whiff in the Weissen House as the “ Kingdom of Tariffs ” , America has deprived the emerging country of trade benefits for 2000 products at the beginning of June . The US has accused India of prohibitively high tariffs and demand better market access for agricultural goods , mobile phones , spirits , motorcycles , and more .	-9.2166
On the world map of trade wars , however , the friction with India is merely a side-show , and America also looks at the world ’ s largest democracy through security glasses . Delhi and Washington combine concern about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean , with a Salve of American tariffs on India unlikely .	-8.8957
The problem , however , lies in another place : the empirically upset thesis that open markets speed up economic development has a severe state of affairs in the Socialist Republic of India , including under Modi , whose reform zeal is aimed mainly at the bureaucratic madness that has been stifling in the multi-ethnic state for too long any entrepreneurial spirit , and firms now receive rapid construction subsidies for construction , , and a more insand bankruptcy law creates conditions for firms to with high .	-10.4551
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings , and in the first five Modi years , India ’ s economic optics have turned a lot for the better . But trade policy does not mean protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers , the National Conservative Government has even created new barriers .	-9.4714
In the West , Modi of the Nimbus of the energetic reformer , who radically renews his country , owing not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like . At the core , however , the " India First " Advocate has never been dictated by a protectionist economic policy , which prevents Indian firms from getting rid of anachronistic processes and thus becoming fit for global competition .	-7.4469

Brexit debate is like a " walk in the park "	-2.1765
The strong verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexiteers in Parliament do not , according to his top adviser , contribute to a climate of hatred . In comparison to the campaign prior to the 2016 Brexit referendum , the current controversy is a " walk in the park " , Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation .	-9.0989
Johnson had attacked Brexiteers in Parliament hard in recent days and accused them , among other things , of ' betrayal ' on the people , accusing them of putting Members at risk because they could , for example , become the target of death threats , he did as ' humbug ' .	-8.5150
Cummings said that the only way to get calm again is for MEPs to finally respect the British ’ s decision to leave the EU , and it is not surprising that people were upset that Britain was still not out of the EU three years after the referendum .	-6.4635

Not even a bottle of water	-0.9932
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the fall of Egyptian President al-Sisi .	-2.1647
The current protests in Egypt have been a tough response by the government , with harsh munitions firing on the population , with more than 2000 prisoners being held in prisons on the 60,000 political prisoners who are already there , and protest has never been harmless in Egypt , but since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ’ s takeover in 2013 , the state apparatus is doing everything to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring .	-9.4721
But one of the triggers of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation ; poverty , lack of prospects , and the feeling of being stifled by their own government is driving millions to the streets , and that is a problem that the el-Sisi regime is not getting under control , no matter how hard it is against adversaries .	-7.6957
Today , every third in Egypt lives below the poverty line ; since 2016 , the currency has lost more than half of its value , the inflation rate is 10 % , and anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide whom to finance : Nestlé , Coca-Cola , or the military , which is not only responsible for repression but also the largest economic actor ; the military is building roads , houses , football stadiums , producing food , and much more .	-7.7145

In addition , fire protection at the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily , and the problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago , this time it is a matter of smoke plunging down as a fire like a canvas , so that the smoke does not spread out too far , and 36 engines must therefore be exchanged at the beginning of the year , and there should be new attempts at hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year .	-12.4947

The young were detained on the pretext of being taught in the Qur 'an and being " blessed " ; in fact , the apprentices were detained by their teachers under " most degrading and inhumane conditions " , said Sabo .	-8.2311
According to the figures , the coral reef had been in existence for about ten years , and the authorities would have drawn attention to repeated irregularities in the establishment , and the parents would have been shocked when they were informed of the conditions in the coral reef , said Sabo , who had no idea of the suffering of their children ; the operator and six staff were arrested according to the police .	-9.7654
There are many private coral reefs in Nigeria ’ s predominantly Muslim north , replacing the often deficient state facilities ; the region ’ s people are suffering from frequent attacks by armed gangs ; according to the UN Refugee Agency , more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in Niger ’ s neighboring state in the last decade .	-9.5186
Armed and tortured : Nigeria ’ s police frees 400 children from school .	-3.4023
Policists have freed almost 400 students from appalling conditions in a school in northern Nigeria . " Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries pointing to torture , " said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna .	-5.0611
There , the children were discovered on Thursday after an announcement in an Islamic school , and the conditions there were ' inhumane ' ; officials arrested the head of the school and six teachers after the liberation action .	-8.0280
The children , all boys , were kept as slaves at their school and placed at chains , some of whom were sexually abused .	-6.5644
World Football Election : Further allegations of Messis and Klopps Kür	-5.4402
Football " Signature not valid "	-2.5850
Jürgen Klopp , Lionel Messi , and Megan Rapinoe ,	-5.0004
With a Gala in Milan , the Fifa World Football Association is the best player , the best player and the best coach of the year .	-4.8255
After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football election , other countries have allegations to the Fifa , and Egypt has not been treated with a curious explanation .	-7.8316
Much of the Fifa has proven to be anathema over the past few years : the World Cup awards , the dubious plans of its president , Gianni Infantino , the general behavior of various corrupt officials , but the Fifa World Football election has not yet been suspected of going unneatly - if one disregards the fact that the voting national trainers and national team captains of the member associations often vote more according to sympathy than objectively .	-11.0773
But , having already complained about Nicaragua ’ s captain , he did not vote at all , more inconsistencies are now emerging : Egypt complains that the votes of national trainers Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account ; indeed , they are not in official and publicly .	-5.6853
The Fifa apologizes that ' signatures have been made on the electoral forms in capital letters and have therefore not been valid ' , and that the Egyptian Association has been contacted on several occasions to clarify the situation - without an answer .	-8.4909
Sudans Trainer also surprised	-2.4489
There is also an outcry from Sudan in respect of the election ; while the situation in Egypt is understandable , the Sudanese Association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally judged : with Lionel Messi in place one , Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three ; according to Fifa , the vote was just as much as it was , with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Association .	-9.0384
Nicaraguan captain Juan Barrera also raised charges : " Did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards , all of which I am wrong , " he wrote .	-7.0439
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on Friday there was a message from the Association : yes , but there was no intention , of course , but the completed electoral documents were ' mistakenly ' with the name and signature of Juan Barrera , the captain of the Nicaraguan selection , said it in a communication from the Federation , but it was actually the second captain , Manuel Rosas . ' We take responsibility for the administrative error ' , stated in the communication .	-11.1699
The other cases are now investigating Fifa , but emphasizes that the election process has been supervised by the consultancy company PriceWaterhouseCoopers .	-11.5921
Ukrainian affair : Ranghohe Republicans are in favour of official investigation .	-3.5677
Two senior Republicans have openly declared themselves in favor of an official investigation against US President and party friend Donald Trump . " I think the investigation is important , " said the Republican governor of the US state of Vermont , Phil Scott . " Where this is from here , the facts are determined " He wants to know more about the whistleblower-affair before action can be taken .	-7.7546
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine , according to Scott Biden .	-4.9163
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the whistleblowers affair , so few have shown unease , and Scott ’ s remarks are now a first sign of Trump ’ s party ’ s moderate governor , Virginia , has repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies , such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules .	-7.9257
As another ranghoher Republican , Charlie Baker , Governor of Massachusetts , spoke for the investigation . " It is a deeply disturbing situation , " said Baker . " The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter , and .	-6.5031
Scott and Baker formally did not participate in the process against Trump , which will be decided in Congress , and their statements are , above all , symbolic ; however , the Republicans ’ first senators were critical of the situation ; Mitt Romney , for example , who represents Utah ’ s federal state in the second chamber of parliament , said that the case was " extremely disturbing , deeply disturbing , " as US media report that the Republicans themselves had first cracks internally .	-10.7642
The affair could result in the launch of an impeachment procedure against Trump , the Democrats in the House have announced an enquiry , accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit .	-6.4447
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment process , with a majority in the House of Representatives , the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment , but the decision on a real impeachment would be in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority , so the prospects for such a process ’ s success are low , and so far no US president has been removed from the office ’ s impeachment procedure .	-8.8663
Goods Folterer on Board of Racketes " Sea Watch " ?	-5.0930
Three men have been arrested in Sicily , they have been raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps .	-2.5905
The German captain Carola Rackete ( 31 ) was arrested in June after being fired on the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 lybischen refugees .	-4.9690
New serious accusations of racketeering are now being made , so three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the " Sea-Watch 3 " ; the suspects have been caught in a detention camp in Messina ( Sicily ) after migrants had recovered their peinists in Italy . " We cannot exclude this , " " , said Sea Ruben Neugebauer of the German press . .	-8.6255
In mid-September , the police reported that the suspects had raped , tortured , and even claimed in the North African country , Mohammed C. ( 27 ) from Guinea , and the two Egyptians Hameda A. ( 26 ) and Mahmoud A ( 24 ) . " Migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - repeated and constant physical violence , .	-6.0553
NGO and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships , ' we cannot scan who is the people , who come without passports ' , said that torture is one of the main reasons why the people of Libya are fleeing , so it is quite likely that the criminals are on the ships ' , so it is very important that this is done ' .	-8.8133
Italy ’ s right-wing ex-Interior Minister Matteo Salvini called for an apology from Rackete , who is still being identified in Italy for helping illegal immigration .	-5.2321
Musk aspires to Tesla ’ s Delivery	-3.5304
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a powerful boost with the prospect of new record numbers .	-4.9753
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries " , wrote Musk in an e-mail published by the industry blog " Electrek " to Tesla employees .	-3.6404
Tesla has a strong demand for 110,000 orders , and Musk ’ s circular letter told us that the challenge is to .	-12.4016
In the second quarter , Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars and thus achieved its record .	-7.4919
Musk needs recorders to achieve its high goals , and in 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars .	-7.6701
US budget dispute : Once again , only bridge financing	-3.7015
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget , and the Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on transitional financing until 21 November .	-5.2179
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years , the United States is once again on the eve of the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October , with the Senate having followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided to provide transitional financing ( Continuing Resolution , CR ) until 21 November , without such a decision , it would have come to a shutdown on Monday , a division of the federal administration .	-9.3049
Shutdown averted	-2.2863
For the time being , the Federal Government will now be financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019 that will end on Monday , because Congress cannot agree on the 12 spending laws that allocate funds to the various departments and authorities , so the Federal Government cannot , for the time being , benefit from the 1.3 Bio budget for the new financial year .	-8.3570
The Democrats in the House of Representatives , where they have the majority , have completed ten of the 12 laws , but the spending laws reflect the Democrats ’ priorities , which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate . Conversely , the Senate has also made ten of the 12 spending plans more or less ready , which are hardly capable of majority voting .	-7.6955
In the Senate , Republicans seem to try to force $ 12 billion for the Mauerbau , one of President Trump ’ s big priorities , disrupting the Mauerbau Wall plans and financing that is actually planned for other military buildings and projects .	-9.0431
The Ghosts of Mauerbau are Different	-4.4205
At present , it is unclear how the parties are going to come closer to this issue , and it is more likely that agreement will be extended to all 12 spending laws in the next seven weeks , extending transitional funding beyond 21 November , and a shutdown is not excluded .	-10.9582
In the context of the ongoing inability of the Congress to agree on the 12 spending laws in good time , and the associated risk of a shutdown will win ideas to automate the process to popularity .	-7.4192
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles	-2.1709
In France , artificial fertilization will continue to be open to single women and lesbians : the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill , whereby all women can take advantage of an in-vitro fertilization , so that demand for anonymous sperm can increase significantly .	-8.1863
In the three-day emotional debate , right-wing critics warned that many " children without father " could grow up in the future , and the French Bishop Conference is against innovation .	-5.6739
The new regulation is the core component of a Bioethics Act , which was defended by the Minister for Health , Agnès Buzyn , as a ' chance ' for society ; it was the modern family in which children with only one parent or homosexual parents were given , and the costs of artificial fertilisation for all women are to be borne by social security .	-9.0783
Closing with sperm of dead husband further prohibited	-4.1416
By contrast , with a narrow majority , the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would allow widows to have artificial fertility access to the sperm of their dead man . In Belgium , Spain , and the United Kingdom , artificial fertilization " post-mortem " was allowed .	-7.3481
Many members of the governing La République en Marche ( The Republic on the Move , LREM ) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had , on the other hand , voted in favour of artificial fertilisation with the sperm of the deceased partner , who stressed that a widow would be subject to a " double trauma " if , by the death of her husband , her desire for child .	-7.7449
The initiators of the now failed amendment find it unfair that a widow can be fertile in the future with the sperm of a unknown , but not with the one of her own partners .	-6.3576
To date , artificial fertilization in France has only allowed heterosexual couples who cannot witness children ; they must be married or live together for at least two years ; Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogate motherhood remains banned .	-6.7383
In Germany , artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples , it is often difficult .	-6.1078
Compensation for the climate : call for flight charges for Unis will be louder .	-6.3741
There will be a lot of flowering at universities , which is why , in future , the country wants to keep a climate tax there , and the rectors say that they have no money for it , but now they are under pressure internally .	-8.8182
The universities should also limit themselves to flying ; photo : dpa / Julian Stratenschulte .	-5.2335
The debate on a climate levy on flights from universities and universities postponed before the summer recess has been postponed again , and after the national rector conference sceptically reacted to an appropriate push from the green / black coalition , the plans now receive support from universities , and in a joint declaration the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical college for compensation of service flights , which is urgently needed as a first step , and at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights , that is , in its opinion , originally planned in July , because the CDU has still not approved the CDU .	-13.3931
Russia Recognizes North Korea ’ s Fishermen	-2.5591
According to the secret service FSB , detainees were to be illegally caught in Russian waters , with 161 fishermen already being arrested from North Korea , when there was a shooting shift between border guards and boat crew , with three Russians and a North Koreans being injured later , but the fishermen were not injured .	-8.2113
The Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages , so North Korean fishermen were on the way to Russian territorial waters , where , according to their own data , the coastguard of Russia is patrolling their Mexican biological resources .	-6.1746
30,000 Tin Fish confiscated	-3.3001
In the case of further controls , 30,000 octopus were discovered and confiscated on the boats , and the claims were confiscated according to three fishing boats and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet by Vladivostok .	-10.9729
Russia ’ s fisheries authority had not spent fishing licences to North Koreans this year , even after complaints by local entrepreneurs , with thousands of North Korea ’ s fishermen being arrested temporarily this year .	-6.7968
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far East region of Primorje , Georgi Martynow , recently lamented high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen , who fished with synthetic nets banned in Russia , which would also remove small creatures from the sea , and would simply dispose of nets in the sea where they needed 200 years to be crushed .	-8.0592
In future , only 18,000 : the US lowers asylum ceiling .	-4.3099
The " most generous nation in history " : Donald Trump , here at a meeting with elected White House police representatives .	-2.6839
The richest country in the world is closing itself to defensive seekers : as Washington State Department confirms , the ceiling for the legal move of refugees is further reduced , and in the future , particularly endangered creditors and Iraqis are to be granted asylum .	-9.9317
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees once again , and in the 2020 financial year , which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020 , the maximum number of 18,000 people is to be left in the country , as the US State Department has said .	-7.7745
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has drastically reduced the readiness to accept protectionists from around the world over the past few years , with much higher revenue limits under Barack Obama ’ s previous administration .	-7.0642
The estimated upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was launched in 1980 , but the US Department of Foreign Affairs described it as " the most impoverished and generous nation in history " , a phrase strongly reminiscent of the language used by the current US president .	-7.9723
A ' responsible handling ' of refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild them , Trump has said , but there is also massive criticism for his tough approach to migration policy .	-7.8829
A major contentious point is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to regulate , and , in order to finance the construction of a border wall , Trump had imposed the national emergency , whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the US capital , Trump is unclear , and is , , and .	-8.3396
The US government wants to focus in future on the reception of two refugee groups , according to the outpost office : people persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who helped the US military in the country , thereby endangering the country , as the Foreign Ministry ’ s statement states .	-8.8997
The US wants people from this ' northern triangle ' of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries , and with this in mind , the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the US southern border with Mexico .	-6.5846

Following his return from the UN General Assembly , Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged offer by the US to lift sanctions , and the United States , in exchange for talks with Tehran leaders , promised an end to all sanctions on its official website .	-6.2917
US President Donald Trump , however , contradicted Iran 's counterpart on Twitter : " Iran wanted me to raise the sanctions imposed on it so that there is a meeting , I said , of course , no . "	-6.5334

On the basis of the booking information and without submitting separate invoices , the hotels in the holiday resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments , as a Zurich-spokesman of the German Press Agency said . " This applies immediately and on condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels are not asked for individual payment of hotel invoices or otherwise required " , said spokesman Bernd Engelien .	-7.4589

Stocking Brexit Negotiations : The danger of a no-deal remains acute .	-2.4693
In fact , Premier Boris Johnson had clearly defined himself : he will not guarantee a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations , but what statements have been made in the polarizing Britons for eternal duration . The recent verdict of the Supreme Court in Britain floated like a sword of Damocles above the blondshopf .	-9.7044
Boris Johnson believes Deal is still possible .	-2.9965
But the pressure does not seem to be noticeably over Johnson , and in the meantime , when he visited a hospital , he suggested that , if the negotiations were not agreed , he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October :	-8.4355

And the time is beginning to run away from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels , with the EU and British negotiators still having time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without agreements , yet the recent talks have again failed to achieve a breakthrough ; an agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine ; if the British Prime Minister does not comply with the law , a renewed postponement of the exit date will come into force , but the opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister , fearing that Johnson might somehow enforce the Brexit deal .	-11.4391

A call in Ukraine , and all is broken , after the turbulent revelations of recent days , US President Donald Trump could indeed be confronted with an impeachment procedure that Democrats want to examine as quickly as possible with their enquiry in the House of Representatives - the question is of weeks until a decision is made .	-7.7772
At the beginning of the scandal , the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is supposed to be the beginning of the scandal : the accusation of whistleblowers , who abused the conversation from concern for national security and for the democracy of the United States with his complaint , is monstrous : the president has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for influencing the election in 2020 ; he has exploited Ukraine ’ s dependence in such a way as to force them to act against a political opponent .	-9.8698
The core of this project is also in the now published signature of the conversation with Selenskyj , although it does not reflect the full text , but the phone of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger history , in whose center is next to Trump his personal lawyer : Rudy Giuliani .	-8.4878
History starts from the public 's point of view in May 2019 when Rudy Giuliani 's New York Times reports travel plans to Ukraine , and he wants to meet with the newly elected President Selenskyj , and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate . " We are not meddling in an election , we are meddling in an investigation of what we have the right to do , " he says , it is inappropriate , but " nothing is illegal " .	-9.1981
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been plagued by right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump ’ s opponent in the 2016 election : Hillary Clinton has colluded with actors in Ukraine , critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia ’ s investigations in the US , but this charge has never been taken seriously .	-7.9654
The Giulianis and the President version of the former vice-president and currently promising candidates for the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden , has urged the dismissal of the then Ukrainian general prosecutor , Viktor Schokin , to stop the investigation he was responsible for by the gas company , whose son Hunter Biden , was a senior bidder .	-15.3722
In fact , the process was slightly different , and when Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian Prosecutor to go , the investigations against the gas company had already been completed , Hunter Biden was never directly affected , and Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt practices , the US government was far from the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal ; moreover , the Obama administration explicitly supported the investigation against the company .	-9.2824

Will Britain ’ s government bypass Brexit law ? Johnson cautiously ?	-4.2009
The British Prime Minister , Boris Johnson , is concerned about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the recently adopted law against unregulated Brexit , and , on a related question , he simply told journalists on Friday that his government will abide by the law .	-9.7975
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the withdrawal deadline , should not reach an agreement with the EU by mid-October , and Johnson criticises this as the ' capitulation law ' that opens up negotiations with the EU .	-7.2564
The former British Prime Minister , John Major , said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law ; Johnson could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after leaving the EU .	-5.9681

What was initially only a suspicion is now confirmed : an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system .	-4.5715
On August 30 , the farthest comet was discovered by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow on the Margo-Observatory on Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres diameter .	-10.0323
2I / Borisov is the second interstellar object after 1I / ' Oumuamua in 2017 that was spotted on a flight of our solar system .	-5.0572
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get from near insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears on nimmers .	-5.9192
According to the analysis , the comet is on a so-called hyperbelbahn , which leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin , as the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) announced .	-7.5685
The astronomers are lucky : in contrast to 1I / ' Oumuamua 2I / Borisov has already been seen in the beginning , so researchers will have many months to study . ' The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will be able to see with medium sized telescopes by April 2020 ' , Farnocchia explained .	-11.4781
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor , so a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii , who had already led the characterization of 1I / ' Oumuamua , showed a clear weld of the comet in a first survey .	-6.7060
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries ( IAC ) have already won a first so-called spectrum of interstellar welders offering a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition .

Resurrection in Washington : Trump wants to see anonymous Tippers in Ukraine ’ s affair	-7.0223
In the Ukraine affair of US President Donald Trump ’ s possible abuse of power , he wants to see potential leaks in the White House .	-4.2073
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information , " Trump said to US envoy officials at the United Nations in New York on Thursday .	-3.9686
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate Tippgeber , and the event was not public , but several US media spread audio cuts from speech on Friday .	-8.6607
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced preparations for an impeachment procedure against Trump on Tuesday , and their accusations are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who makes serious accusations against Trump and his central government .	-6.9276
In his work , Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government officials that the US president uses " the power of his office " to ensure that another country meddles in the US 2020 election .	-5.4773
At the heart of the accusations is a contentious telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July , in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that could damage his political rival , Joe Biden , former business by Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine , and alleged efforts to protect his palaces from Ukraine ’ s judiciary . Biden lies in the race for the democratic presidential campaign for the 2020 election .	-6.8414
The whistleblower accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine-Telefonat : Leading government officials would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling .	-6.6529
The identity of the referee is not publicly known , and the New York Times reported that it should be a member of the CIA 's foreign intelligence service .	-4.9793
On Friday , Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source , and in a series of tweets on the subject , among other things , the president wrote that " whistleblower " has spread information from second hand , which would have turned out to be incorrect , so there may be no tippers or spies at all .	-7.9465
As Trump said in New York about the whistleblower information , but disgusted , the US House Chairman , Nancy Pelosi , responded , lamenting Trump ’ s statement once again undermines the government ’ s integrity .	-7.1308
In the House of Representatives , various investigations have been underway in various committees against Trump and his environment for months , and , given Ukraine ’ s accusations , Democrats are now advancing investigations with new rage to launch a possible impeachment process against Trump .	-7.4979
" The Whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation , " said the chief intelligence committee in the House of Representatives , Adam Schiff . Trump attacked ship sharply , threw him a false account of things , and called again for the resignation of the Chairman of the Committee .	-7.3570
More than 300 former US officials from the security and foreign-policy area , mostly under democratic but also under Republican presidents , were behind the Democratic investigation launched on Friday for a possible impeachment procedure . If the allegations were to come true , that would be “ a ruthless abuse of power ” by Trump .	-9.2192
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure , with a majority in the House of Representatives , the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment procedure , but the decision on a real impeachment would be in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority , so the prospects for such a process ’ s success have been low , and so far no US president has been removed from office ’ s impeachment procedure .	-9.5735
VW Works Council : Jobs are reduced " creeping " .	-3.3064
The VW brand ’ s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe , and this concern is driving the auto company ’ s works council to reduce its annual factory costs by EUR 10 billion by EUR 2 billion by 2023 , of which EUR 500 million will be saved this year .	-7.8227
A key to this is staffing costs , and the ' Future Pact ' negotiated between companies and works councils in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14 000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020 : a job can only be dismantled if it is proven that the related activities are no longer necessary , and employment security by 2029 .	-9.5944
As our newspaper has learned from business councils , however , jobs in production that are not in fact disposed of are being cut " creeping " over another path - that is to say , the official course , which often does not re-occupy vacant regular posts .	-11.2414
In these cases , the works council has no means of enforcing re-occupations ; in the meantime , there have been a lack of staff who are suspicious of the worries about the gradual blueprint of the vehicle plants , so that there is also a fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe , because it is cheaper in other parts of the world , and only VW said that ' an adjustment of the employment volume will be made as agreed in social terms along the demographic curve ' .	-14.2248
The VW brand wants to standardise production worldwide and to centrally manage new projects , thereby reducing costs and also accelerating decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and therefore competitiveness .	-8.1960

But before it is so far , astronomers can watch it in depth , because , unlike his predecessor , 2I / Borisov has already been seen in his first visit , which means that he can be investigated by the Earth for many months . " The object will reach the greatest brightness by mid-December and then be able to see medium sized telescopes by April 2020 , " explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency Nasa .

According to the first findings , the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter , while the celestial body appears to be similar to our comets - because , as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it , the spectrum of welding is similar to that of welding , suggesting that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our complementary de Leóns colleague Javier Licandro .	-7.2582
The observation goes beyond individual knowledge , however , and the fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way of investigating certain processes in other solar systems .	-6.3620

If you conclude an internet contract , you do not need to rely blindly on the speed specifications of the providers , and customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved .	-8.9946
After all , the previously promised transmission rates are a contractual component and should therefore be achieved , the consumer centre of Bavaria explains .	-5.1115
If the connection is always much slower than advertised by the provider , there are different test possibilities , so the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency ( BNetzA ) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract .	-6.5481
" However , the supplier tests are carried out according to supplier specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively " , the consumer centre of Bavaria should be considered on its side .	-7.1838

May showed himself shocked and cheated on her blog that had nothing to do with this action , but in order to underline that , she postulated the original : she , in conversation with citizens , put a cup in her hand , but she did it right , was from bamboo , and she always said that it was only a matter of subjecting the party logo to the picture , and not of concealing something from the photo .	-12.4389
May writes that she is suffering for the staff who have done so , ' I do not want to describe it as stupid , but there was nothing to hide ' , she says to the Guardians and is also inherited from her overcommitted team : ' If they want to edit an image , then they could not do what with my face , so that I can look younger ?
