Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends Rauswurf of the journalist
Governor Steffen Seibert has defended the smokescreen of a journalist from the press conference by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In Germany, Turkish journalist had a T-shirt with the Turkish and German signature "Freedom for Journalists" and went to the first row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has created a strong unrest, which is unacceptable.
He therefore led to the man's protection.
Seibert said that it is not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor's Office.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are alleged espionage activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some journalists accused of imprisonment for several decades.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: only early September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel.
They were free and were able to return to Germany, but they still run against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller.
So freshly and cheerfully know him his fans: Florian David Fitz.
We have to look at two times: yes, that is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Night" is known for feuchtfröhliche conversations at the Theke of Hamburg Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderatorin Ina Müller encounters with its guests, some wine or even highly processive drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few promis also drink for the obligatory singing temptations.
On Friday, another episode of the popular Talkshow.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz, known from films such as "Männerherzen", "Terror - Your judgement" or "Der geilste Tag".
The trip to the Münchner got the excursion.
On Saturday, he was a rarest - his face is completely broken, the eyes only two small slices.
The Bett-Selfie shows a completely lauded Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only one powerful cater.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - knowledge he has now won: "rule one: does NIE to Inas night.
Rule two: never gets the black sucking.
And injection.
And the round of eggs, the Ina round of half three, let also go away.
Alcohol account is written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the aftermath.
They were enriched by instantaneous, fish crumbs or - probably most targeted - headache tablets.
Other amuse simply look at the sight of the normally attractive Kinostar.
As Ina Müller has survived the night Sauflager has not yet been known.
Since they have been moderated since 2007, the 53-year olds seem to be far tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and the Unrat.
The entrance to the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Scherben, cigarette kibs, garbage and unrat, demolished dustbin and now dismantled signs - this has been presented for a long time with the entry group to the Radweg on the Haaße-Hill in Treysa.
For the Vorzeigeobjekt Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland region is more than an awful sight.
The topic employs members of the ADFC-village group Schwalmstadt, but also others for longer, so the Radtraffickers of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the Committee on Transport.
There is no solution.
The proposals were submitted from the meeting of the group to regular decommissioning of waste and cleaning of land at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible further activities', says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that have also been submitted to the local council.
Not only the rubbish driving cyclists and residents - the seat group is on weekends.
It is not only often loud, but also destroyed: posts from the earth, dustbin bin demolished, shields from the earth, rubbish bin bin, shields, shielded furniture.
Volunteers would have already reported more frequently, ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
You are annoying that the Rastplatz on the Radweg in Treysa meeting point for Sau.
"Along the entire cycle path it is situated on the Haaße-Hill, the Radomomomer, which is now also the new radar facility in Ziegenhain, which is now opened.
"Make the same fate, it is quite expensive '.
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps the threshold is significantly higher to reach common good.
But that would then require a police strike at a close time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the Haaße-Hügel.
It must be more attractive.
The frequency of the radar system has so far been very satisfied with the frequency of radar.
Tourism marketing is still able to grow.
Our bike path is very high in comparison with other Germany in high quality ", the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger situation, ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in the Ascheröder Street in Treysa.
There is no biegespur on the Haaße hill.
It is possible that cyclists must wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow flow, "explains them.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Musik-Contest im Kulturbahnhof: Die "Kö von Hiltrup" und der See der See ".
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and co-existence.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the city's participation offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eyelids in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke said.
In fact, it was soon a family co-existence with coffee and cakes of the Honorary Office of Culture.
Seven formations took place, from the Ein-Mann-Band to the great ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long in Hiltrup living Albachtener, the Neun of Hiltruper Sternfarben, three members and three generations of Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not yet seen that in other parts of the city.
What were the textures?
In the places the Hiltruper See and market allee especially frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig the Allee in his striking song to the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Time and again it was about the experience of co-existence in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke belebte the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their work.
So he learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also guitar.
Franke ’ s Tontechnician Stefan Schemmelmann knew that the recent meeting in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed on Youtube.
"It is not about winning", Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper gastronomy...
For the favorites of the jury, there was something special - so that others can hear their songs.
A whole CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his help drums, the Franke especially with his music, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, children joined the finals once again - and even without electronic support "right", as Franke said.
The jury was inspired by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, intransigence of melody and recognition.
The jury belonged Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß von KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahler from the economic verbund as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The city ’ s part offensive had created the event of its ten-year anniversary.
It valued the event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the near future very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game etest.
The players are two teams facing each other.
For each side there is a visibility screen, four cards with keywords that can be removed - the old trick with the red slide - only if you have hidden them.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything.
On the cards, for example, from left to right: "1 Renaissance.
2.
3.
4. Fest ".
These are the terms that must be encrypted.
Because guns are not supposed to guess but codes.
Changing a player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card that may be "3.4.2".
Errates are not supposed to be listed in "Decrypto", but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice", "Fest" and "windows" - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opponent team will not be able to crack the code.
The encoder notes and reads loud: "Werfen" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to feast, "Lose" as opposed to feast; here would of course also be as "party" and "Prague" because he was in school and knows the windows there.
This is the way round, team for team.
You do not know the terms of the other side - but you can get together with any indication that the encryption there is better.
Perhaps mysterious, but not to be turned off, the changeover is so difficult for his team.
The crypt of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule stitch.
The players will probably have to study it very long and detailed until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But whoever has settled, will be fascinated, how much feeling is in this unbearable game.
In total, however, "Decrypto" is not as coherent as the predecessor and Genre-Primus "codenames", which is also an agent of a game of less words, but much better to play in small groups.,..,...........,,
And whom it is only about rats and not winning points, which can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Mann shows police hitlergruß and harassed guests in the pub.
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspectorate Kulmbach at night from Saturday to Sunday.
It was not only in the upper town of a pre-occupied police strike, and later he also fell in the upper city in a pub when he was other guests.
After being clearly alcoholised by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in prison cell.

Pressig was home to Schubloks.
The railway company in Pressig was the hub of the Frankenwald River.
In 1991, a piece of railway history.
"When buffers of buffers, you heard it all over Pressig", Georg Dinkel, who tells the story of the place and the train station.
That did not inspire anyone.
Because quietly the brakes and scarce the wag.
That was just a railway line.
Statements that are useful for Dinkels ’ s homeland.
Nirgendwo in the Frankenwald, a place was shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-Bergstrecke to the north, which after an increase of about 220 metres of altitude.
To cope with this, train and Schubloks were needed in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway company with 21 localities, apprenticeship and railway mastery.
In 1899, Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, Bahnhistoriker and 47 years of professional trainers.
In 1968 the Bamberg was operated by Bamberg in 1968, the Bamberg were also operated for the secondary routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalf-half-run.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported by a staff of 160 man; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the route in 1939 minimized the need for train and Schubloks.
From 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 walls were ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were broken off.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we do not envisage better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport '.
At Pfingsten in 1989, Nuremberg celebrated the "50 years Elektrifizierung Nürnberg - Saalfeld" was a pompöses Bahnhofsfest in Pressig.
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here", Georg Dinkel.
Little later.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the senior station of Pressig was history.
"The ranking and inhibitors learned the most difficult work in train traffic", recalls Dinkel.
Any misuse would have fatal consequences.

Her role of the chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76), but on January 1, 2018 she went forever on board.
The series she made Star may be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been one reason.
After all, I was awakened with this work, I travelled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my fellow Members took me on an equal footing with the "picture on Sunday".
First of all, she has always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody, but this has changed with the" Traumschiff ".
For now, journalists have only called Heide Keller.
"I do not know him so well.
She considers it possible that her damalian man could have been envious, but "as many men also shy Hans talks about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be the only right thing for Hans von Borsody. He wanted to know my weaknesses.
That is, in a good German: I understood how she explained.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I never was, even if I appeared on stage sometimes frech and courageous.
I wanted our love for always'.
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes, "although I was afraid that it could go a second time."
On the day before the standesamtlichen Trauung saß ich heulend in Garderobe and wanted to cancel everything.

I have been too naive to love '.
The night falter, who visited the city in the NZ-Resort Zurich regularly hosts the night life of the city, has.

The Falter studies the shield at the roller staircase: "wear a long dress, please be careful on the roller staircase".
If the two separate instructions, he has wasted himself in the Dressc.
But it is rather a conditional structure, and certainly has saved life.
In the household warnings on the upper floor kippt of poultry, an espresso prepared cocktail called "Golden Eye".
The price for the best drink is not mandatory.
And George Clooney, who has been campaigning for years, is not here in the evening.
But there is a difference between local alpine rominenz, Kassentisch and kitchen items, a face over which the observer is known: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character is not going far.

It is not done, it is not possible to get scattered.
It is precisely for this restraint, like a misunderstanding, that international stars of this film festival.

Engpass on air traffic control is even worse.
Frankfurt / Hamburg After European air traffic chaos in summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind, and then the storm", said the head of the trade union of air traffic control, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight accidents is the long-known staff in European air traffic safety, for which there is no quick solution.

At the moment, EU targets would be voted on by 2024 and there are further worries.
The EU is under constant pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair chef Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now have exactly what they sat in recent years," Maas.
He hope that the high delay costs for airlines have introduced a rethink.
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) provides a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
The inclusion of 120 lotteries that have been announced to date 120 pilotage over the next five years in order to offset.

Why, despite successful integration, there are increasingly conflicts?
In answering the question of a metaphor.
At a table, German society is sitting on the table, the first generation migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to join the table.

Initially more behavior, then always rains the discussion round.
And there is talk.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how to succeed or unsuccessful integration among pupils.

Even during the subsequent signage, he still has an open ear for the questions of guests and also in the foyer, prepared Kurdish specialities.
