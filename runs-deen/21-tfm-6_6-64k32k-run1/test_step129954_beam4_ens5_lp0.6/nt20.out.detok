Iranian port oil tanker Stena Impero
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas this Friday.
The Iranian government had already released the tanker on Monday, but initially it remained in Iranian waters, and the shipping company said that it wanted to wait for an official statement from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was accused on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Hormuz Sea Road on charges of violating safety regulations, but it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary setting of an Iranian oil tanker before Gibraltar, which is part of the United Kingdom.
Hormuz Road is one of the world ’ s most important sea roads, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean, with much of the world ’ s oil exports being shipped through the straits, with tensions in in months, from into between the and, with several incidents with and.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mysteries solved: That ’ s why we cannot tickle ourselves.
A kind of brake in the brain prevents people from ticking themselves, as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening, even though progress has been made on the question of why children fight themselves so fiercely against the tickling, only to demand more.
After all, it has also become clear why only getting closer to a tickling hand causes laughter before touching it.
According to earlier research, rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound when they are spiked by humans.
Laughter is suppressed while Self-touched
In the course of the experiments carried out on the rats, it was assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touching and touching by others - that is to say, people cannot cheat themselves.
In this sense, it is not the case that a person's brain is not able to chew itself, but rather that the mind of the rat cannot distinguish between the self-touch and the touch of others at the same time.

Brexit: Johnson ’ s Own Sister Criticized
The prime minister ’ s sister commented on Boris Johnson ’ s speech at the first parliamentary session after the suspension of the Wednesday evening, threatening to lead the country without an EU deal on October 31, should Brussels fail to agree to his demands for amendments to the Brexit agreement, but how he intends to do so is unclear.
As the Prime Minister, via Cox, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, said: "The best way to honour Jo Cox's memory and reunite that country would be to withdraw from the EU," Cox was by a right-wing extremist during of the referendum campaign in. of in, of of of of.

Iran Frees British Tankers
The United Nations General Debate did not resolve the Iran conflict, but now there is one problem less: the British oil tanker, which has been detained in Iran, 'Stena Impero', has been able to strike sea again; it could be a piece of a puzzle in Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been detained in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now going to Dubai for medical examinations, declared shipping chief Erik Hånell.
"This is part of a sample of attempts to undermine freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
In the aftermath of the Second World War, the United Nations Security Council (UNDP) and the United Nations Security Council (UNDP) signed a treaty establishing the United Nations Security Council (UNDP) with a view to establishing the United Nations Security Council (UNDP). of the UN Security Council (UNDP). of the UN Security Council (UNDP), the UN Security Council (UNDP) and the UN Security Council (UNDP).
The British Government, behind the stipulation of the 'Stena Impero', suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: at the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, was put in the chain, with the authorities violating EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria, and the British receiving the reference to the ship from the United States.
In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released.
Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean, and most of the world's oil exports are shipped through the straits.
Iran ’ s leaders have been accusing Iran of wanting to build nuclear weapons, and the US unilaterally withdrew from the international nuclear deal in 2018, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been putting pressure on Iran ’ s leaders to impose tougher economic sanctions on the country, and Iran has resisted pressure.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for the military protection of commercial ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus to the UN General Assembly in New York.
India is obstructing a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
With America ’ s President Donald Trump imposing punitive tariffs on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People ’ s Republic are being forced to redeploy, with Asian heads of finance considering moving their production from China to another country, India, in a UBS survey, cite it as one of the preferred alternatives, not just to do with the imponderables of the Sino-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be set to play a more important role in the global production chain.
But now India itself has got into Trump ’ s focus, dubbed the “Kingdom of Tariffs ” by the White House, America in early June stripped the emerging country of trade preferences for 2000 products. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, however, friction with India is only a sideshow, and America sees the world ’ s largest democracy through security spectacles as well. Delhi and Washington combine concerns about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean, and thus an unlikely Salve American punitive tariffs against India, so India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken office for a second five-year term, is likely to weigh in safety.
The problem, however, lies elsewhere: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development in the Socialist Republic of India has a difficult state; Modi ’ s zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic insanity that has suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long; firms are now receiving faster building permits for buildings; they benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure; and a more manageable bankruptcy and bankruptcy law creates the conditions to liquidate high-debt, sham firms.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings, and many things have changed for the better in India in the first five Modi years, but this is not true in trade policy, driven by protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, even creating new barriers by the National-conservative government.
In the West, Modi ’ s nimbus of the energetic reformer, who is economically radically renewing his country, is dependent on the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. But, at the core of the India First Advokat, he never depends on protectionist economic policies, which prevent Indian firms from being forced to abandon anachronistic procedures and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the closure of their industries are among Modi ’ s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ’ s regular electors, and are applauding this short-sighted policy.
Appointment of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The news agency AFP reported that the funeral was scheduled to take place in the close family.
Aimed at competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships.
In the first run of the men over 5000 metres, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to waver dangerously, but he could hardly hold himself on his feet just 300 metres before the finish, ran into an unhealthy and ill-tempered position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly stopped him, supporting him in the last half of the stadium round.
"I just wanted to help him, everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly drew the attention of the assembled journalists, and he didn't want to talk at all about his heroism, because he wanted to set up his personal record and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a sufferer, and in any case he would be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Cup, and under normal he,.
In the end, it had nothing to do with the fact that Busby, who had only come to his destination with a great deal of help, was disqualified by the World Athletics Federation.
While Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, came to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha, which, according to official data, was 18: 10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run for 17: 55 minutes, I was already under 18 minutes," but only in training, the best times do not count.
Millions: Egyptians Wake Up for Wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible anti-government protests, with a reinforced police presence in central Cairo on Friday, with several underground stations closed and streets around central Tahrir Square closed.
In the past few days the police had stepped up their roadside controls, and the mobile phones of pedestrians had been partially searched for news and photos related to the protests.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, and Mansura, hundreds of people protested against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has accused the critics of corruption and mismanagement; there has not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years; the Egyptian developer and actor Mohammed Ali, who launched the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "million march" in central places for today's Friday, Ali calling for a "popular revolution." The man is not a good man for most young Egyptians either, because he is a subcontractor for the army of millions of people, but his messages are coming.
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had more than 1,570 arrests until Friday, with the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) reporting more than 2,000 arrests.
Arbitrary arrests
HRW is a member of the United Nations Security Council (UNDP).
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, so the government in Cairo is blocking Web sites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealers: Dealers should be able to donate returns more easily.
For online retailers, many of the packages that are lost are items that are sent back, leaving about 20 million returns in the trash, but there is an alternative.,,,,,,,,,,,
The Treasury has shown online traders like Amazon and Zanando a way to donate skillful products, rather than destroy them.
While companies could not be exempt from VAT on material contributions, the ministry explained to the Green Bundestag group, which the newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday, the dealers could set the market value of unsellable returns so low that they would have to pay little or no VAT.
According to the current legal situation, about four per cent of the goods - about 20 million products - ended up in waste, and to donate would cost the companies additional money, because the financial authorities assess donations like sales, which would then be subject to VAT.
Katrin Goering-Eckardt, leader of the Green Group, called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies cannot evaluate saleable products and donate free of charge to nonprofit organizations.
Banksy Art at auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting.
The well-known work of Streetart star Banksy, Devolved Parliament, will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksys ’ work highlights "the recollection of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world of the basic attitudes of animals and tribes".
The work was first exhibited in the Bristol Museum in the southwest of Britain, where Banksy lives, in 2009, when the artist re-exhibited the painting, coinciding with the original Brexit date on March 29, when the work, formerly called "Question Time," was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change the owner for a million euros.
Most recently, at the House ’ s first meeting on Wednesday, following the Supreme Court ’ s removal of a forced break imposed by Johnson, Prime Minister Boris Johnson engaged in a harsh exchange of views with the opposition. Johnson wants to do the already twice postponed Brexit on October 31, if necessary, without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate: at Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture of a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a knife, and thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors to the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit debate is like a “walk in the park. ”
According to his top adviser, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’ s violent verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hate.
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexiteers in parliament in recent days, accusing them of, among other things, "betrayal" of the people, accusing them of putting MPs at risk because they could be targets of death threats, he dismissed as "humbug."
Cummings said that the only way to restore calm would be by respecting the British decision to leave the EU, and it was not surprising that people were upset that three years after the referendum, Britain had still not left the EU.
In the face of the upsurge of sentiment, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday: 'We should speak with respect', a statement said, 'and we should also listen'.
Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Khan Calls for Uno Intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again urged the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
If not, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN General Debate in New York. "If things go badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst," the United Nations would have had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You".
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each have a share of Kashmir, and another part of China. In early August, India had withdrawn autonomy from India ’ s Kashmir region, thereby dramatically increasing tensions with Pakistan.
Not Even a Bottle of Water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
In response to Egypt ’ s current protests, the government is reacting with a hard hand, firing on the population with live ammunition, more than 2,000 arrested cronies in prisons with the 60,000 political prisoners already in detention.
But one of the causes of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation, with poverty, hopelessness, and the feeling of being stifled by one ’ s own government bringing millions to the streets, and that is a problem that el-Sisi ’ s regime, no matter how hard it is against adversaries, has also failed to get under control.
Today, one in three people in Egypt is living below the poverty line; since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the rate of inflation stands at 10%, and anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who to pay for it: Nestlé, Coca-Cola, or the military, which is responsible not only for repression, but also for the largest economic actor; the military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food, and much more, as it did before el-Sisi, with authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one; it will always afford a bottle of water when large sections of the population have difficulty.
Tüv Terminal Checks: BER Chef: No more 'showstoppers' for capital airport
Two months have been tested to determine whether the complex mesh of the BER-Brandschutz system works together.
After extensive Tüv audits at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October of next year, as was clear from a meeting of the Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider.
The airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal.
However, there are indications that the time reserve will not be too large any more, and the construction certificate will now be submitted to the Building Office during the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of electrical cables are still to be remedied; the Tüv wants to examine them by February.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is a matter of lack of proof, not so much of new cables, and that there is still no release for all the nozzles on which the cable lines are attached, which the head of the airport expects to see before the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily, the problems that led the project to another crisis three years ago: this time there are smoke aprons that will be shut down like a screen on a fire so that the smoke does not spread, and 36 engines have to be replaced, so that at the beginning of the year there will be new experiments with hot gas smoke.
The airport was originally scheduled to open in 2011, and costs increased from €2 billion to €6.5 billion ($6.6 billion) since construction began in 2006.
Since passenger numbers in Berlin have risen significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport, which is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October is due to take place, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new Managing Directors: Financial Director Heike Fölster changes to the Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Human Resources Director Manfred Bobke-von Camen retires next year, as Bretschneider said, and thanked Fölster for putting the airport ’ s finances on a firm footing.

From January 2020 onwards, the Austrian Air Force will take over the “Wetlease ”, which includes Eurowing personnel.
The speaker explained that the Eurowings base in Vienna is to be integrated into the AUA turnstile and network planning, with flight times to be adjusted for connecting flights.

Study of the causes of heart disease
There are many different types of cardiovascular diseases, such as: smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet, and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases through the analysis of the genetic heritage of 9000 people.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, announced on Friday by the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
Some of the main factors influencing cardiovascular disease are obesity, smoking, and unhealthy nutrition.
At the moment, more than 4,000 of the roughly 20,000 relevant human genes known to be possible disease-causing changes in DNA – so-called mutations – were reported by the hospital, with approximately 200 each year.
According to the initiators, the goal of the five-year project is to develop new options for prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks.
The head of the Kühne-Stiftung, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a firm will to use the data for the research of other diseases.
The University Hospital Zürich, Switzerland, and the University of Zurich, Switzerland, have announced that the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and the University of Zurich, have signed a new agreement with the University of Zurich.
According to the UKE, the total cost of human gene sequencing in the world was 1300 euros.

In Nigeria, police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school, and, according to evidence from local residents, the security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the minor victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said.
In fact, the protectors were held by their teachers under "most degrading and inhumane conditions," said Sabo.
According to reports, the Koran school has been in existence for about ten years, and local residents would have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the establishment, and the parents would have been shocked to learn about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo, who had not been aware of the suffering of their children; the operator and six staff were arrested by the police.
In Nigeria ’ s predominantly Muslim north, there are many private Koran schools that replace often deficient state institutions, with people in the region suffering frequent attacks by armed gangs, and so, according to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to neighboring Niger in the past decade.

World Football League: Further charges of Messis and Klopp ’ s pumpkin
Football 'Signature Not Valid'
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi, and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year.
Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the World Soccer Election, and other countries made accusations against the Fifa.
In the past few years, many of Fifa ’ s actions have been criticized: World Cup awards, dubious plans by its president Gianni Infantino, the general conduct of corrupt officials.
But, having already complained to Nicaragua ’ s captain that he had not voted at all, there are other inconsistencies that are emerging: Egypt is complaining that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account; indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting list.
The Fifa apologises for the fact that "the signatures on the voting forms were in uppercase and therefore not valid".
Sudan ’ s Trainer Surprise
There is also an outcry from Sudan about the election, and while the situation is understandable in the case of Egypt, the Sudanese Association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the way it was finally estimated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three.
Nicaragua ’ s captain, Juan Barrera, had also made accusations: “did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards, and all the details of my vote are wrong, thank you, ” he wrote.
On Friday, the association reported that it was true but, of course, it was not intended: the voting documents were "mistakenly" marked with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, as stated in a communication from the Association, but actually elected the second captain Manuel Rosas.
The other cases have now been investigated by the Fifa, but stress that the election process has been supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers., Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the of the World, and Jürgen Klof of.,,, and.,,,,,,
Ukraine ’ s Affair: Rangert Republicans favor official investigation. of the,,,,,, and.
"I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts to be found," he wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine, according to Scott, "for years."
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the Whistleblower affair, and few have been uneasy about it. Scott ’ s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party, with the moderate governor of Virginia having repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as relaxing environmental legislation and tightening immigration regulations.
"It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right course of action and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it.
Scott and Baker, as US state governor, have no formal say in the proceedings against Trump decided on in Congress, so their statements are particularly symbolic, but Republicans ’ first senators have also been critical of the situation. For example, Mitt Romney, who represents Utah ’ s state in the second chamber of parliament, has said that the case is “extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing. ” US media have also reported that the Republicans are beginning to crack internally.
The affair could lead to an impeachment process against Trump, with the House Democrats announcing an investigation into it, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment; with a majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make an impeachment; but the decision to actually impeach him would fall in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have a majority, so the prospects for such a process are slim. No US president has yet been impeached by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they are said to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after having unlawfully steered the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board.
"We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any reliable information," said "Sea Watch" spokesperson Ruben Neugebauer of the German press agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured, and even murdered, namely Mohammed C. (27) of Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and.,,,,,,
"We cannot scan who the people are," said Neugebauer, who said that torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya, so it is quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships.
Italy ’ s right-wing ex-Interior Minister Matteo Salvini immediately apologized to Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk is seeking a record extradition of Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record figures.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," said Musk in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
According to Musk ’ s circulars, Tesla ’ s demand was strong, so Tesla could place 110,000 orders, and the challenge was to bring cars quickly to.
In the second quarter Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars, reaching its previous record.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals, and in 2019 plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars in six digits in the current and next quarter year, with the most favorable Tesla Model 3 in demand, but the margins are low.
US Budget Revision: Once again, Only Bridge Financing
The new financial year will begin in the US on 1 October without a proper budget, with the Senate following the House of Representatives on Thursday and adopting transitional financing by 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to raise spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, the United States is once again on the eve of the new fiscal year, beginning on October 1, without spending plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21, without such a decision, a shutdown would have occurred on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration.
Shutdown Off
For the time being, the federal administration will be financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the 2019 financial year ending on Monday, because Congress has not agreed on the 12 spending laws to allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities, so the federal administration cannot, for the time being, benefit from the extended spending framework for the new fiscal year from $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion.
The Democrats have completed ten of the 12 laws in the House of Representatives, which have a majority, but the spending laws reflect Democrats ’ priorities, which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate, and the Senate has also more or less ready ten of the 12 spending plans that are unlikely to win a majority.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion to build a wall, one of President Trump ’ s main priorities, and the Democrats are bothered by the wall construction plans and funding that other military buildings and projects are planning to build.
The Divided Wall
At the moment, it is unclear how the parties are going to get closer to this issue; it is more likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws over the next seven weeks that transitional funding will be extended beyond November 21, and a shutdown will not be ruled out.
In view of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in good time, and the risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity.
France permits artificial insemination for lesbians and singles. in,,, and, and,, and, and.
In France, artificial insemination is to be open to single women and lesbians: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill requiring all women to have in vitro fertilisation, which is likely to increase demand for anonymous sperm donations.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics on the right had warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future.
The new regulation is the core part of a bioethics law that Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an 'opportunity' for society, creating the modern family in which there are children with one parent or with homosexual parents, with the idea that the cost of artificial insemination for all women should be covered by social security.
Prohibition of sperma of dead husband
In the past, there have been cases in Germany in which women have complained in vain that the sperm of a deceased person has been released.
Many members of the ruling La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had opposed artificial insemination with the sperma of the late partner, stressing that a widow would be "twice saddened" if her husband's death left her wish to have children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the amendment, which has now failed, consider it unfair that in future a widow may be infuriated with the semen of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
In France, artificial insemination is permitted only to heterosexual couples who cannot afford to have children, who must be married or live together for at least two years.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: Calls for a flight charge for Unis are getting louder.
There is a great deal of flying at universities, which is why the country wants to have a climate tax levied there in future too, and the rectors say that they have no money for it, but now they are also coming under pressure internally.

Russia Reclaims North Korean Fishermen
Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested and, according to the FSB, there was a fire exchange between the border guards and the boat crew, with three Russians and one North Koreans being injured and the fishermen later dying from serious injuries, but this time there were no injured.
Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages, with North Korean fishermen travelling in Russian territorial waters, where, according to their own data, the Russian Coast Guard patrols its marine biological resources.
30,000 octopus confiscated
In addition, according to the data, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia ’ s fisheries authorities had not issued fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after appeals from local entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested there for a time, according to the media, this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently lamented high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen, fishing with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia, which would also bring small living beings out of the sea, and simply dispose of the nets in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be dismantled.
In the future, only 18.000: US cuts asylum ceiling.
The 'most generous nation in history': Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is closing itself off to those seeking protection: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be lowered further, with the aim of obtaining asylum in the future, above all, in the case of threatened believers and Iraqis.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low threshold for receiving new refugees once again, with a target of 18 000 people in the marketing year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, as the US State Department has said.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has slashed the acceptance of asylum seekers from around the world in recent years, with far higher admission limits under Barack Obama ’ s previous administration.
The target ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was launched in 1980, yet the State Department called the US "the most merciless and generous nation in history," a phrase strongly reminiscent of the current US president's parlance.
Trump explained that “responsible handling ” of refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild, and that supporters support his hard line on migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
One major point of contention is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to close, and Trump has imposed the National Emergency to finance the construction of a border wall. Whether there is a temporal link between the current action and current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure over the Selensky affair and a possible impeachment process.
In the future, the US Government, according to the Foreign Office, wants to focus on the admission of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are therefore in danger, as the Foreign Office statement points out, whereas a maximum of 1 500 refugees are to be received from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The United States, in particular, wants people from this' northern triangle 'of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries, and against this background the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.

Italy ’ s Long Stadium Ban
"@ officiasroma You already know what to do with such a fan.
The club responded late on Thursday, reporting the fan ’ s account to Instagram and the police, and the Roma supporters were not allowed to return to a game of the club, the club wrote on Twitter.
"We cannot have racism in society or in sport; in Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious: we have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said at the weekend when he said that racist chants at the first league match between Atalanta and AC Florence last Sunday.
The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rioting fans of record-breaking Juventus Turin from the stadium, four of whom are no longer allowed to enter the stadium for a ten-year period, according to the police.
The club was founded in the early 1990s, and the club was founded in 1999.

Iran / US Conflict: Rouhani talks about the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iran ’ s President Hassan Rouhani, when he returned from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions, and the United States, in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, promised to end all sanctions, Rouhani declared on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump disagreed with his Iranian counterpart via Twitter: 'Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there could be a meeting, I said, of course, no'.
Rouhani recounts what happened: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and pressed for a meeting to take place. "And America says I will lift the sanctions," adds Rouhani, the kind of punitive measures that should be ended have been on the agenda. "And they clearly said we would lift all sanctions."
But this move was not in an acceptable way, Rouhani criticized; given the sanctions in force and the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met Rouhani in New York, with Europeans hoping to rescue the Iran nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China, which is designed to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed hope on the fringes of the UN General Assembly that Rouhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 Aftershocks
On Friday, the Turkish Vice-President, Fuat Oktay, said that 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday, and since the earthquake the previous day there have been almost 200 aftershocks, the Turkish Vice-President, Fuat Oktay, said.
On Thursday, Oktay announced that the government intends to use a commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes.
In the past 20 years, Istanbul ’ s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu has been inadequately prepared for quakes, saying that the city itself repeatedly ignores the latent danger.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas registered in the centre as sanctuaries have long since been built.
On Thursday, the epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Marmara Sea, in front of the Silivri district and about seven kilometres deep, as the civil protection agency Afad announced.
Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, announced on Twitter that he had not reported any injuries or damage.
Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey, with a population of more than 17,000.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when the earthquake occurs is unclear.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have finished packing go-bags next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes, and when the next big earthquake comes is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured, and some buildings suffered slight damage. Istanbul ’ s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, followed developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom), according to which two minarets of mosques crashed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariy.
Warning about aftershocks in Istanbul
In the last few years, a number of people have been using the Internet to find out more about the current situation in Turkey.
According to CNN Turkey, there was an aftershock of 4.0 on the Richter scale only a few minutes after the first earthquake.
On Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 hit the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul, and its epicentre was located in the Marmara sea west, the civil protection Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made the headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a serious earthquake.
Researchers assume that, sooner or later, there may be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul – the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high; scientists believe that it will eventually unload – and cause massive damage.
According to Ersoy, the earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy is now a warning, making it more likely, he said to CNN Türk, "This could a of to a earthquake," according.,,,, and,,,,,.,,, and,,,, and.,,,.,
There was an incident just a few weeks ago - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul - and there was a violent earthquake in Albania just a few days ago - there were 68 people injured, and this year the earth also prayed on Lake Constance.
Parliament: New Launch in Ukraine
Two explosive documents add fuel to the Ukraine affair for US President Donald Trump ’ s possible abuse of power. On the way to a possible impeachment process, US Democrats have been reassured: the complaint about Trump, filed by an anonymous whistleblower, and his controversial telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president, raises important grounds for investigating the president, and Trump himself once again sees himself as a victim of a “witch-hunt, ” and doubts about the whistleblower ’ s credibility.

Inspired by Kafka, Ian McEwan writes the Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos?
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Polymorph", the British successful author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27, according to Diogenes Verlag (Zurich), which deals with the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his earlier life but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain, seeing it as his mission to put the will of the people into practice, and is determined to be stopped by nothing and nobody.
McEwan was quoted as saying: 'When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers shamelessly lie as Soviet leaders once did, when high-ranking Brexiteers are almost pleading for the catastrophe of a no-deal, then a writer has to ask what he can do; there is only one answer to this: write'.
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into a monstrous monster", is gradually being excluded from family and society, and ultimately is dying. "Ian McEwan bows before Kafka to describe a world that stands head," Diogenes Verlag said.

Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until 31 October.
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all trips until October 31, 2019, one day after his insolvency application.
In addition to this, the company has also made reservations for the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid out or fully paid.
The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs around 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money back to hotels from now on.
However, as of this Friday, hotels abroad which currently host Thomas-Cook holidaymakers will receive money from the Zurich-Versicherung.
On the basis of the booking information and without the submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts will now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a spokesman of the German Press Agency said.
The insurance company responded to reports by hotel guests who said they had to pay for their accommodation on the spot, some of whom had to put more than 1000 euros on the table.
On Friday, as many hotels were affected, the insolvent travel provider, said the policyholder.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the announced payouts to hotels through Zurich insurance only help passengers who are currently on the road, and for Thomas-Cook customers who still want to fly on holiday, it looks bad.
The company has opened its doors for travel starting on November 1, 2019, and, in accordance with insolvency insurance, the further procedure has been examined.
The company refers to the Zurich insurer, which is represented by the Kaera company.
Prince Harry Destroyed Explosive Mine in Angola
For a long time Prince Harry has continued the commitment of Lady Diana, and in Africa he is now walking in the footsteps of his mother.
In Angola, British Prince Harry, dressed with a blue shard vest, ignited and destroyed an explosive mine.
On Friday morning, the British Halo Trust ’ s camp at Dirico, he set the detonation circuit in front of running TV cameras.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997), with the same war-master who accompanied his mother, to travel the way she went then.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, starting in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The Danger of a Noremains.
In fact, Premier Boris Johnson had made a clear choice: he won ’ t guarantee a third reprieve to the Brexit negotiations; but what has been the case for the polarizing Briton is perpetual. The recent Supreme Court ruling in Britain hovers like a sword of Damocles over the blonde, his suspension of parliament to carry out his Brexit course until the exit date was annulled early this week, and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to postpone bilateral talks until October 31, in the event of a failed EU negotiation.
Boris Johnson Still Posses Deal
But the pressure does not seem to be palpable over Johnson either, and he has since hinted at a hospital that if he fails to do so by the end of October, he will support an extension of negotiations:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal, I am cautiously optimistic that it will work.
And time is beginning to run out of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels, with the EU and British negotiators still having some six weeks left to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement; but the recent talks have again failed to make a breakthrough; an agreement by the end of October seems difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister fails to act, a renewed postponement of the exit date is in force, and the opposition does not dare the prime minister ’ s words; it fears that Johnson might somehow prevail in the event of a no-deal.

A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump may indeed face impeachment following the turbulent revelations of recent days; the Democrats want to check that as soon as possible with their House inquiry – there is talk of weeks before a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj is alleged to have made a telephone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The whistleblower ’ s charge, which ultimately brought the conversation to the public with his complaint out of concern for national security and democracy in the US, is monstrous: the president used his office ’ s power to exploit another country ’ s government to influence the 2020 election, using Ukraine ’ s dependence as a means of blackmail and forcing it to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also evident in the now published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, though it does not reflect the full text. But the July 25 phone call is only an episode of a much larger story, centered around Trump, with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view, history begins in May 2019, when Rudy Giuliani's New York Times reports to Ukraine: he wants to meet with the newly elected President Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation to which we are entitled," he says to the newspaper, saying that it is inappropriate, but "nothing is illegal".
The lawyer and former New York Mayor seem to have infected themselves with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump ’ s 2016 opponent: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to create an occasion for the US Russia investigation, but that charge was never taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk about so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The Giulianis and president version is that Joe Biden, a former vice president and now promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, pressed the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Attorney General, Viktor Schokin, as Ukraine ’ s envoy to the Obama administration, to stop the inquiry into the gas company that he was responsible for, in which his son, Bider, was a member of the supervisory board. Biden, who had blackmailed Ukraine financially to cover up the corrupt practices of his family.
In fact, when Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian Attorney General to go, investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected, and Schokin was himself deeply corrupt, the US government was far from the only Western partner to push for his dismissal, and the Obama administration explicitly supported the investigation against the company.

Elon Musk Boosts Tesla Stocks
Musk wrote an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek".
The challenge is to bring the cars to the customer quickly, and to do so Tesla must offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
In the second quarter Tesla delivered over 95,000 cars, reaching its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals, and in 2019 plans to deliver a total of 360 '000 to 400' 000 cars, with six digit numbers in the current and coming quarter of the year, and the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low.
Will the British government bypass Brexit law? Johnson reticent?
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains bogged down over whether he is seeking ways to circumvent the law passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit, and, on Friday, he simply told journalists that his government would abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal period if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October, and Johnson criticizes this as a "surrender law" that made negotiations with the EU more difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major assumed Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, and Johnson could use a procedural trick to delay the law's entry into force until after the EU leaves.
Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union. 'We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October and the best way is by agreement'.
Iran seems to be hoarding uranium enrichment
Iran ’ s President Hassan Rouhani has increased the pressure on Europe ’ s contractors in the dispute over saving the historic nuclear deal. “Unfortunately, European states are showing incompetence or unwillingness to take concrete action, ” said Rouhani at a press conference on Thursday at the fringe of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
The US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 to force Iran to change course in what it considered aggressive Middle East policy, and President Donald Trump ’ s government to a of tougher, with of harsh.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a report, confirmed that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing to use the centrifuges installed in early September, and that Iran is preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges, according to IAEA data.
Perhaps Europeans are not prepared to bear their share of the deal, and so left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of oppressive US sanctions, alleged Rouhani, but there will still be further talks that I hope will bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran ’ s involvement in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the carnage changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom responded on Monday to the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," said Rowhani, who would not have been able to do so in talks with him during the UN General Debate, but who would have merely claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this, as Rouhani had met Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, Rouhani demanded that the US administration ’ s far-reaching sanctions be lifted, calling on the Washington administration to switch to a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet by another Star Tricks the Solar System
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the outer space, which was achieved first, and the comet is able to draw conclusions about other solar systems.
What was initially only one assumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system.
The large comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter.
2I / Borisov, after 1I / 'Oumuamua of 2017, is only the second interstellar object that was spotted when our solar system passed through.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to gain insights into a foreign solar system from close proximity before he vanquishes in Nimmerrese.First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles that of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysics Institute of the Canaries. "The current speed of comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance well above the typical speeds of objects that orbit the sun," said Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa in a communication.
According to the analyses, the comet is on the way to a so-called hyperBelt trajectory that takes him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced, and is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. in honour,,,, which,, was in,, and., the, and,, and.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been spotted, leaving researchers for many months to study.
A team of scientists from the University of Hawaii, Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already conducted the characterization of 1I / 'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers from the astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already won a first spectrum of the so-called interstellar welder, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "of from of of our solar,,,,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The IAU estimates that the discovery of two interstellar visitors in just two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems, but how many such visits are difficult to predict.
The agency intends to deploy the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028, according to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, either lying on a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system or on an interstellar visitor like 1I / 'Oumuamua.
First Landing on Beijing ’ s New Mega-Airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th anniversary of the People ’ s Republic, a first Chinese United Airlines passenger aircraft has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of China ’ s capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
Chinese President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project.
The complex has four runways, which will later be extended to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system.
The Chinese had already said on several occasions that Berlin could learn from Beijing, but the opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and far smaller - has been postponed time and again, four.,,, and,.
New supersonic aircraft is to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney.
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the dream of which is the UK Space Agency - is to make possible this supersonic flight (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the agency by the US Senate, 'This is the technology that could definitely be achieved', said agency chief Graham Turntock, 'we are talking about the 2030s and the work is already well advanced'.
In the United States, the Concorde was the first aircraft to be operated by the United States Air Force.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," says Reaction Engines on its home page.
Riot in Washington: Trump Wants to find anonymous typographers in the Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair of possible abuses of US President Donald Trump wants to detect possible White House leaks.
“I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information, ” Trump told US officials in New York on Thursday that the person concerned was almost“ a spy, ” and that in the past, they were “a little differently ” than they are today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate the typographer, and the event was not actually public, but several US media outlets broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday, with Democrats reacting incensed to the President's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for an impeachment procedure against Trump, based mainly on the written complaint by an anonymous intelligence worker, who makes serious accusations against Trump and his administration headquarters.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials that the US president "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country interferes in the 2020 US election in his favor.
At the center of the charges is a contentious telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that might harm his political rival, Joe Biden, about former deals by Biden ’ s son, Hunter, in Ukraine, and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice, leading the race for democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukrainian telephone call: senior government officials have tried to keep the exact wording of the call in the ceiling.
The "New York Times" reported that it should be a CIA foreign intelligence officer.
On Friday, Trump again questioned the source ’ s credibility, and in a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the “whistleblower ” had distributed second-hand information that would have turned out to be inaccurate, so there might be no pickers or spies.
But, as Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have provided information to the whistleblower, outrage triggered. US House Chair Nancy Pelosi reacted alarmed and complained that Trump ’ s statement once again undermined the government ’ s integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his surroundings have been underway for months in various committees, and, given Ukraine ’ s accusations, the Democrats are now pushing forward an investigation with new force to initiate a possible impeachment process against Trump.
“The whistleblower has given us a road map for our investigation, ” said the head of the House ’ s intelligence committee, Adam Schiff. Trump grabbed ship, accused him of misrepresentation, and called again for the resignation of the chairman of the committee.
More than 300 former US security and foreign policy officials, most of whom were under Democratic, but also Republican, presidents, backed the Democrats ’ investigation that was launched on Friday for a possible impeachment process. If the allegations were true, it would Trump ’ s “ruthless abuse of power. ”
There is no precise timetable for further proceedings, with a majority in the House of Representatives allowing Democrats to pursue a so-called impeachment procedure, but the decision to actually impeach him would fall in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have a majority, so the prospects for such a process are slim. No US president has yet been impeached by an impeachment procedure.
VW works council: jobs are being 'creeping down'
The VW brand ’ s plans to reduce production costs further could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe, which is driving the works council of the car manufacturer, which wants to reduce its annual factory costs by EUR 2 billion by 2023, of which EUR 500 million is to be saved this year.
The ‘ Future Pact ’, negotiated between companies and works councils in 2016, already provides for 14, 000 job losses in Germany alone by 2020.
However, as our paper has now learned from working council circles, jobs in production that are not actually available are being 'creeping' through a different route - that is to say over the official course, so that vacant regular jobs would often not be re-filled.
In the United States, it is estimated that the number of people working in the United States is about to increase, and that the number of people working in the United States is about to rise, the number of people working in the United States and the number of people working in the United States.
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide and centrally manage new projects, which also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness.

Enforced into prostitution by Voodoo: Trafficking in human beings
Young women from Nigeria have been subjected to gays, trafficked into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected human traffickers have to be imprisoned for this.

Cook-Default: Hotels get Money from Insurance
Some banks are likely to pay dearly for the travel provider Thomas Cook's bankruptcy, according to a press report, with high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans, which also affects Credit Suisse, writes the Financial Times in its Friday issue.
According to the report, banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit, and Credit Suisse would probably have to make a total write-down of up to GBP 1.8 billion (around EUR 2 billion) on their books, as the consultancy company AlixPartners estimated.
Bond-debt creditors would have to accept write-offs of £900 million to £1 billion and lenders of £550 million to £825 million, with the actual write-down amounts likely to be at the top of the bandwidths, one expert told the story.
The extent to which the creditor ’ s losses will actually be at the end of the insolvency proceedings will become apparent, and one person associated with this process did not raise too much hope: for example, the 40 or so aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK are “old ” and many of the properties are in bad locations, and the most money could be obtained by selling the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, they said.
Rackete alleged to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
The Sea-Watch-captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any reliable information about it," said refugee spokesman Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants have recognized the three men in Italy, accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya, accused of having been arrested in the detention centre in Messina, Italy, and newly, who stressed that refugee organisations could not check who they had on their ships.
On 29 June, Carola Rackete illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa, collecting a ship from the Italian financial police, and on that day the three suspects are said to have arrived, and the captain is under investigation for aiding illegal immigration.
The US Federal Government Warn Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting Huawei, China ’ s network supplier.
We believe that the risks are too great, "said Pai to the" Handelsblatt "with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that requires any company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security agencies.
Current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, "says FCC CEO, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of confidence" from suppliers.
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" on the basis of its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible; the 5G technology is not just hardware:
This software consists of billions of lines of code that change over time, "said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "wherever, would be able to check each individual update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continues.
He accuses the Chinese corporation Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque, and the company that supposedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government, "said Pai to the" Handelsblatt ".
The US had evidence that government officials were placed within the company, and Pai recently called for talks in Berlin to promote the US position.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
A huge wall of fire illuminates the sky above a chemical factory in France.
After a fire at a chemical factory in the northern French town of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not be exposed to the smoke, and there were no injured people; farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop harvesting for the time being.
According to the prefecture, there were 240 fire fighters and 90 policemen and gendarmes at the fire station.
The French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of Lubrizol, which produces additives to oils.
The factory in Normandy, according to the authorities, belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly supervised, and in 1976 a devastating chemical accident occurred in the Italian Seveso near Milan.
It is the largest city in the United States and the largest city in the United States.
Rouen is a regional metropolis located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: 'Germany must invest now'
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, "said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for next year.
The minister warned that the eurozone economy was weak.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to take the necessary decisions'.
Acting would require those states that had fiscal space for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with Germany in mind.
France does not have these margins, the Minister added, referring to its country's high public debt, which is more than 98% of gross domestic product, and the French must be "stabilised" and "", said Le.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to invest more publicly in order to revive the European economy, and German politicians have repeatedly called on France to rein in its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government ’ s response to protests by the Yellow West movement, among others, is to reduce new debt to 2.2%, after expected 3.1% this year.
Is he still trying to deceive? Johnson is avoiding Brexit tactics.
The British Premier Johnson sharply criticizes the "surrender law" passed by Parliament.
The parliament is back, a law prescribes that Britain ’ s prime minister avoid a chaos Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson might use another loophole, to which the Tory politician is alluding.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains bogged down on whether he wants to push through an unregulated Brexit – despite the law recently passed by parliament, which is intended to prevent that. Johnson simply told journalists that his government would abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal period, should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October, and Johnson criticises this as a "surrender law" that made negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister, John Major, said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, that the prime minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the law's entry into force until after the EU had left.
Johnson ’ s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, announced that he felt the political disputes surrounding Brexit were a “walk in the park ” and was confident that the desired EU exit will come about:“ We enjoy this, we will win, we will leave (according to Red.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign prior to the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as the chief strategist in Downing Street, the UK ’ s government headquarters, behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister to an almost hopeless situation.
Linda McCartney's Polaroid Diaries
The album was released in November 2007, and was released in November 2008.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her in 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September, including Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "# ThePolaroid Diaries is a fleeting look into the life of an exceptional family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film".
The camera was always there with Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found it for photography.
In his foreword, the art critic Ekow Eshun writes: "She wanted real moments," and of course, the focus is always on one thing: your man Paul - as you may have never seen before.
Mary McCartney said that she had been sleeping as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes.
Like almost any other medium, the Polorad camera captures the immediate moment, and Linda McCartney ’ s recordings are certainly a family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's all about making a decision: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you, and then you have to kneel at exactly the right moment, "said Paul McCartney.
"The Polaroid Diaries" is not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great anecdotal pleasure, where landscapes also seem like abstract paintings.
'We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran '
Turkey, despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, wants to continue to import oil and gas from its neighbour country, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a Friday interview that Turkey cannot stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy gas from there, "Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil because some companies had "withdrawn because of US threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey will 'continue our relations with Iran particularly on this issue and on many other issues', said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran ’ s oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf have intensified significantly in recent months.
The US government wants to curtail refugee intake
On Thursday, the US State Department declared that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from now 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, a 40% cut.
The State Department declared that while the US remains committed to supporting refugees, the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on accepting two refugee groups: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are in danger, as the State Department statement points out, while a maximum of 1 500 refugees are to be received from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The 1980 program selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program ’ s history. The current ceiling of 30,000 is a low, with US President Donald Trump ’ s predecessor Barack Obama leaving the White House at just under 85,000.
"This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, who would further damage the US leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to limit immigration to the US strictly, legally and illegally, according to the US government, which expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year, separately from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - 'Close to a Spitz'
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage in the Whistleblower affair, and anyone who has given evidence to the whistleblowers who blame him for abuse of power “comes close to a spy, ” said Trump, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York, according to several US media outlets.
When asked about the person who informed Whistleblower about controversial White House affairs, Trump replied, "It comes close to a spy," and then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart?
Observers valued the latter remark as a possible reference to the death penalty, with Democrats sharply criticizing Trump ’ s statements and accusing him of intimidating witnesses, as well as an attempt to obstruct a congressional inquiry into a possible impeachment process against him, the House ’ s chairs wrote.
In a recent complaint, Whistleblower accuses the president of abusing his office to seek interference from another country in the 2020 US election, including his controversial telephone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyy in the summer: during the conversation, Trump advised him to investigate his potential democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, in Ukraine.
The Whistleblower is an international intelligence agency.

In a few years, WeWork is rising from a small start-up to a driving force in the world ’ s most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis, with landlords fearing billions of dollars in revenue.
WeWork ’ s crisis threatens to upset the balance in the world ’ s largest real estate markets, with founder Adam to a, to, and with the sale of subsidiaries and, such as private jet for executives to gain financial in the coming weeks,,,, and.
WeWork is a company that has a strong track record in the field of corporate design, design, design, design, and design.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into rental contracts of up to 15 years of commitments of more than $40 billion, which could be a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire property markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the property market could shift noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive start-up.
If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off some of the expected billions of dollars in revenue.
Russia Recepted Numerous North Korean Fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen, and in recent days, a total of 262 poachers have been arrested who have fished illegally in the waters, according to the Interfax Agency's National Security Service (FSB) on Friday.
Just ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested, before the border guards had been attacked and three injured, this time there were no injured, it was said, and Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages.
North Korean fishermen have been on the way to Russian territorial waters, where Russia ’ s coastguard, according to its own data, is patrolling their marine biological resources, detecting 30,000 octopus at the renewed controls, confiscating three fishing and two motor boats, and bringing them to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok, according to Ria Nowoti, which reported a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
According to the media, the Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after appeals from local entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been arrested there for a time in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently lamented high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen, fishing with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia, which would also bring small living beings out of the sea, and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be dismantled; nor would the vessels themselves comply with sanitary and technical regulations.
The arrests last week, according to Moscow ’ s data, had injured three members of the Russian coastguard, and a similarly wounded North Koreans later died of his injuries, according to the FSB. On September 17, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat, and then a second after it opened the fire.
USA Imposing an Entrance Ban on ex-President Castro
As President of the Communist Party of the Caribbean, he is the head of a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily detained and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
"The disrespect of human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," commented Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced bans on entry, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military, and a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging in Venezuela for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Maduro ’ s government to bring him to his knees and bring the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president, Juan Guaidó, to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of Maduro ’ s closest allies, and Venezuela ’ s socialist Caribbean island receives oil in exchange for the services of doctors sent to Cuba.
New Fridays for Future Climate Protests
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning once again actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world, starting with the shift in time between New Zealand and Australia, before protests across Europe move to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a major rally in Montreal, Canada, and demonstrators wanted to rally in front of the White House in Washington.
"Last Friday, more than four million people strove for the climate," she wrote on Twitter.
On the other hand, the number of demonstrators in Germany has increased significantly since the beginning of the last few days, and the number of demonstrators in Germany has increased by about 1.4 million.
At the age of 15, Thunberg took part in the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to urge their country ’ s politicians to make a greater commitment to climate protection, which has led to the Fridays-for-futures movement being launched in a short space of time, with of students, and of,, and of.
Together, they demand more ambition from policymakers in the fight against global warming and the looming climate catastrophe. Above all, the Paris climate agreement must contain global warming below 1.5 ° relative to pre-industrial times.
On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN to raise her awareness of the world ’ s leaders in her home city of Stockholm, where she was awarded the Nobel Prize for her commitment to climate change by the Right Liveli.,,,,,,,, and.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony, which provides for a change in fire safety.
It is also possible to buy cigarettes in the United States.
Beat Cybercriminals - Investigators Lift Server
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time steered a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites on which international criminals operated their activities as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle.
Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action.
Among the suspects ’ customers are alleged to have been the operators of the world ’ s second-largest drug Darknet market, “Wall Street Market, ” which investigators crushed in the spring, and the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled via a server in the cyberbunker, according to the Attorney General ’ s Office.
One such hoster was first opened in Germany, it was said.
The access action, supported by special units such as GGSG9, has had searches in Germany and neighbouring countries, as a result of almost five years of investigations, and at noon investigators want to inform about further details.
New Global Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement planned new actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and towns such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests  Who are Thun ’ s backers?
In a world full of war and smoke factories that warm up the climate, even in the 21st century, the great virtues of justice and courage are all the more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl of all times is holding the mirror in the eyes of the powerful people of this time.
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses on the move and encourages young people to stand up for a better climate friendly world; it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to attract a collection of children and young people.
In addition, Greta Thunberg has a rich PR manager at her side, and by the way, her mother has published a book that has sold widely, thanks to the spotlight ’ s daughter, and the tried and tested Greta Thunberg follower was a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too thick for some of her successors, and this is not without reason, because the campaign has been very well publicized in the media around the world and there is a lot of money going on thanks to the impressive action., of and of,,, of and of.,,, and,, of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and,, and.,,,,,,,
This is where the ghosts are divided: is it morally right to make a financial profit from the saving of the world, and is it still authentic for certain circles of people to work with stock-market brokers during the global campaign?
Comet discovers: Interstellar Guest Cross by our Solar System
A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The astronomers ’ guesses have been confirmed: a strange comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time researchers have only suspected it, but now they are certain that a comet from another star is crossing our solar system at the moment.
2I / Borisov: Komet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea.
This body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in the Crimea, who looked towards the sky with a self-built telescope, and further observations confirmed his first suspicion, which is actually an unknown comet not from our solar system, but only the second of its kind that was spotted during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain insight into a foreign solar system from close proximity, and apparently the commet resembles that of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands.
Comet was already spotted before flying - and can be observed for several months.
"The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and will be seen by April 2020 with medium telescopes," says Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa. "It will be until October 2020 with only larger, professional telescopes.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
Initial findings on Komet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science.
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter, while at the same time the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of weld patterns is similar to ours.
The fact that two of these objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids keep busy with the researchers, and recently a giant asteroid passed by the Earth and came close to it dangerously.
'Absolutely reprehensible ': Rachel Johnson appalled Brother
In the first place, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, and now his sister clearly castigates the prime minister's belligerent language as "distasteful." It is not the brother she knows.
"capitulation", "fraud", "contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is continuing to arm - at least verbally - at Question in the House of Commons this, with of opposition and of dozens: dozens of bishops and his own sister, Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told broadcasters Sky News that their brother uses words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, dragged, relegated, tested and flattened," which they consider to be utterly reprehensible; they do not recognise their brother's version, said Rachel Johnson, who stood for the anti-Brexit Change UK party in the European Parliament elections.
In particular, she found that her brother, Jo Cox, mentioned an EU-friendly member of the House of Commons murdered by a neo-Nazi just days before the 2016 Brexit referendum, whose memory could best be honoured by moving through Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons. "It is very distasteful to refer to an MEP murdered by someone who called 'Britain first', who now criticized Johnson's sister, who had apparently come from the far right wing, who felt 'vindicated by this kind of language'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It makes me sick when Jos's name is used in this way," he tweeted: the best way to honour her is to speak passionately and firmly in favour of what you think - no matter what you think - but never "demonize the other side", and he also complained that an atmosphere has arisen in which attacks have become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory deputy. "I have been torn between family loyalty and national interest in recent months - it is an unsolvable tension," Jo Johnson founded the move.
Johnson's language was also strongly criticized in the Church, and, as the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language "unworthy of that country." In a joint statement, they said, "In recent days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has been unacceptable, and we should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez play the Super Bowl.
The NFL sets a strong mark in the year of its 100 years of existence: In the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
In the final round of the NFL football league, Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) are to deliver to.
"I feel incredibly honoured and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," said Shakira in a video.
The American football league finale, which will be celebrating its 100th anniversary next year, will take place on February 2nd in Miami.
"I love the Super Bowl this time putting two women on the stage - and two Latinas," explained Lopez, who sends an important message to all Americans and the world, "an explosion of fun and".
In the 2000s, Lopez landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud", and later released songs in Spanish.
Shakira became the star of a telenovela and singer in Colombia.
The announcement of mid-term guests is eagerly awaited in the US every time, and this year many see the choice as a political gesture, because the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump ’ s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest sporting event in the United States and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle.
In the early 1990s, the band had a reputation for being one of the most influential bands in the music industry, and the band had a reputation for being one of the most influential bands in the world.
An actor and YouTuber has appointed Egypt ’ s ruler: for the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have influence on whether blood is again flowing on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad; one of them returned to Cairo airport on Friday; President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly; the ex-general who ousted the Muslim Brotherhood Mohammed Morsi, the country ’ s first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump praising his actions against political Islam and not losing a syllable about human rights violations on the Nile in a week when Egypt ’ s security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president.
Mohamed Ali is, of course, a foreign country, where he has escaped the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil.
He was the first to be elected President of the United States, and he was elected President of the United States in 1896.
After last week's first demonstration of thousands against his rule since Sisi's grip on power, and nearly 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, Ali called for a "million march" this Friday.
On Friday, a massive police presence was reported in the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where protesters grabbed banners with the president ’ s portrait last week, building checkpoints in the city and on the runways, closing several subway stations in downtown Cairo for “maintenance work, ” blocking most streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, and in the Raba Square, where supporters of the ousted Muslim Brotherhood Morsi were buried in 2013, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, preventing another measure to prevent disassembly: Sisis ’ s Future Party, here, wanted a major rally for the president.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera.
When Provider Promises Too Performance
If the internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different testing possibilities.
If you sign an Internet contract, you don ’ t have to trust the speed data of the providers blindly.
After all, the transfer rates promised in advance are an integral part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre of Bavaria.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities, for example, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (Bnetza) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"Die Tests der Anbieter erfolgen jedoch nach bürger-specific Voraussetzungen und sind daher nicht eineineinsam und objective berechnet", stellt die Verbraucherzentrale Bayern auf ihrer Seite zu berücken.
If the connection is considerably slower than announced, customers may set a reasonable time limit of usually 14 days to manufacture the promised service.
If this does not happen even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and may also claim damages, but if the success fails, only the plaintiff will be able to help.
First High Republicans for Investigation
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it goes from here is determined by the facts to be found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday, who wanted to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the removal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the Whistleblower affair; few have signaled unease about it. Scott ’ s statements are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as relaxing environmental legislation and tightening immigration rules.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Further Marvel Film
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future, so Tom Hollands Spider-Man would not be part of the "Avengers" universe.
Spider-Man is the first film to be released in the United States to feature a new version of the film, the "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home".
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boos Kevin Feine is quoted: "I am delighted that Spidey's path continues in the MCU.
It is said that Sony Marvel has made an offer, but according to industry magazines, Walt Disney, which also includes Marvel, would contribute 30% to the revenue of coming Spider-Man films.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the Suits financial centre.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the grand finale, with many happy ends and just as many cameo appearances, and also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked in the series for many years, receiving a charming tribute.
In the final, Duchess Meghan did not return for a final farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the backdrops once again showed the most memorable scenes with today ’ s Duchess, such as the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his ousted sentence.
Her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the Suits section, of course in a wedding scene.
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accidents
A baby and four other children drowned while capping a refugee boat in the Aegean, and seven people died in total, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Invousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland, saving four children, three women and five men.
At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, which, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), killed 174 people last year, and the Federal Minister of the Interior, Horst Seehofer, has now announced plans to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wanted to find out about the situation of refugees in Turkey ', said Seehofer on Friday, and then to learn more about the' administrative problems of the Greeks' in Athens in order to be able to help to deal with them.
On Friday, a spokeswoman of the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seehofer with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an extraordinary number of migrants continue to arrive from Turkey, and on Tuesday alone 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, as the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increased figures have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who illegally pass through Turkey to the Greek islands, in exchange for the EU ’ s desire to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for any Syrian who has been deported.
Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos have a population of just 29 400, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection.
Never since the EU-Turkey refugee pact came into force in March 2016 have there been so many, state radio reported.
Climate Change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to medical experts, climate change will in future put the health system to the test, and climate change will be one of the greatest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology.
Green politicians have to answer for embarrassing photo pans.
The Canadian Green leader, Elizabeth May, campaigned on an election campaign - was the cup manipulated for that reason?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a backpack on a photo, but now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
The Canadian Green Party ’ s reusable coffee cup has never been held in the hands of Elizabeth May, the head of Canada ’ s Green Party, on the party ’ s website she was on a photo with this cup, talking to citizens, but the photo had before been published and to the media –,,,,, etc.,, and.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blaming for Photopans
The National Post then accused May of manipulation, and that the party produced fake news to appear more credible on “environmental protection, ” in the midst of an underhouse election campaign, in which Trudeau, too, is finding it increasingly difficult to get involved in a bribery scandal.
The photo was viral in the social media and sparked the discussion about fake news.
May was shocked and prayed on her blog that she didn ’ t know about this action, but to underline that she immediately put the original one: she, in conversation with citizens, had a cup in her hand, but she was right to say that she was from bamboo.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she told the Guardiansand, at the same time, asked herself something of her over-committed team: "If they want to edit a picture again, could they not do what with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Green Party (Greens), too, was in danger of falling into a trap because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel in Shitstorms.
Influencers want free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban on Cathay.
Jaqueline Ng was reportedly assured that she would upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay Pacific again.
Business class upgrades are offered immediately - many passengers dream of them, sometimes lucky, and the staff at check-in offer free travel from Economy Class.
The airline Cathay Pacific has actively requested a free upgrade, with more than 65,000 users following Instagram, followed by Jaqueline Ng on May 30, 2008 to New York and June 7.
Jaqueline refused to upgrade on the flight, although she reported a mail saying that her Cathay Pacific was planning to upgrade.
Jaqueline, a former member of the JFK team, was forced to leave Jaqueline for the next two years, and Jaqueline, a former member of the JFK team, was forced to resign from Jaqueline.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaqueline Ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific.
In her case, she turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not provide the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: Cathay has been scammed by the influenza woman, she remains blocked for future flights, and the airline ’ s terms and conditions state that she does not have to pay for the new flight.
Oil Prices After Report on Armistice in Yemen
On Friday afternoon, oil prices dropped by more than one dollar in a very short space of time; last, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea Brent cost $61.83 – about 1.4% less than the previous day; the price of a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3% to $55.77.
The slide was triggered by the Wall Street Journal ’ s report on a ceasefire in Yemen, which Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil facilities had stalled 5% of global oil production, with Iranian-allied Huthi rebels in Yemen ’ s civil war calling for the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran, and a ceasefire would defuse the region ’ s political tension.
If an agreement is reached, it can focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, leader of the Commodity Strategy Division at the Saxo Bank of Bloomberg news agency.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil cost nearly $59, Brent nearly $65.
Most recently, Bloomberg, citing insiders, reported that oil repair works in Saudi Arabia are moving faster than anticipated after the attack in mid-September, so that output has returned to eight million barrels a day, moving back toward the original quantity.
Most recently, there have been several press releases, citing insiders who report rapid advances in repair work by Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, but raw materials experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock exchange and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, the conflict between Iran and Western countries has been somewhat relaxed: the British oil tanker Stena Impero is on the way to leaving the port more than two months after Iran ’ s launch and the recently issued clearance, with the crew preparing to leave while the ship is still at anchor, according to shipping chief Erik Hånell, in an SMS message to Swedish radio on Friday morning.
But the US announced that it would transfer defense missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia as Iran ’ s arch-enemy. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom had temporarily boosted oil prices significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump are intensifying
In the case of possible abuses of power by US President Donald Trump, accusations of cover-up have been made against the White House, with several leading government officials working hard to prevent access to the talk at the end of July following a contentious telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyy, a statement by an anonymous whistleblower.
North Korea ’ s Third Trump and Kim Summits
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be held in the nuclear dispute. The purpose and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in implementing first-summit agreements in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to KCNA.
The US would not have done anything to implement last year's summit decisions, said North Korean State Department adviser, criticizing increased US sanctions and joint military maneuvers by the US and South Korea, but hoping for a "wise" and "courageous" decision by Trump to return to rapprochement.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know first what a third summit with Kim was supposed to bring before he agreed to do so. Negotiations to disarm North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second Trump and Kim summit in Hanoi in February, and both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas in June, agreeing to revive the talks, but with little success.

Pound under Pressure - Expected Interest-Rate Reduction
British Pound under pressure
With interest rates falling soon, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculated that the Bank of England (BoE) would cut interest rates early on, and the British currency reduced by up to 0.4% on Friday to $1.2269.
Central banker Michael Saunders made the sales spurred a cut in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit can be averted, as uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future, a surprising proposition, given that Saunders is a proponent of restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus Activdes.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the economic burden of the Brexit shock without directly signaling an interest rate cut, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanting to lead his country from the EU on October 31, even without a divorce agreement.
More: The British Prime Minister has taken a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping Other Russian Manipulation
Material from the analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, a former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's chief of integrity of the World Association of Athletics.
New details of the doping scandal are emerging in Russia at the start of the World Athletics Championships – and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and even in some way. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic cheating in Russian sports had been revealed, and the Wada had closed the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During that time, Russian athletes were not banned entirely from the world stage; the International Olympic Committee, after an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, had some 270 athletes under a neutral flag, and 168 Russian athletes were on the start at the Winter Games in February 2018.
Positive findings lack
In the following September, the Wada again called on the Rusada man, but called for access to the laboratory and the samples in question.
The president of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data has been manipulated from the Moscow analysis laboratory. "Yes, we the data nine months ago and we should check to to," said David in "Frankfurter" "" "" "" "" ".
The World Cup Not Attached
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: the Athletics Association is the only organisation that holds a ban on Russia.
At the beginning of this week, Wada had already begun manipulations and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks, with Russia now threatening to freeze the Rusada again and, in the worst case, to exclude it from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
