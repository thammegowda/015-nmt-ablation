DFB Chairman Grindel sees no basis for Özil Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question which of course depends on you coming into conversation, talking to him about why he has apparently felt one thing or another as set out in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmowers" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite months of debate over Özil ’ s photographs with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he deplores the resignation of the 92-fold national player, Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case, "Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it on the grounds that Grindel did not defend him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared to talk to federal trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up pressure, but he knows from football that if "you leave a team or change an association, you talk about it with your trainer and I think it is a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Gartenhütte in Schrebergartensiedlung Burned
At 2.13 p.m., the trade fire brigade Linz was alarmed to fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage pipeline leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, the danger was delayed.
The fire brigade came out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be virtually completely removed and fire-fired to the extent that was absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden-hut, he had taken a battery to store at midday.
That may be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined, as must the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Wrath Mother Defends: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee families on the open streets
What motivated Lindsay Lohan to take this very strange action?
It seems that she wanted to take the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has himself streamed live, as she seems to want to take away the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see Lindsay Lohan, "Happily Join".
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family fled from the actress, Lohan pursued parents and their children.
It accuses adults of trafficking in children.
She does not provide any proof of this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this straight", Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to track the family along the road.
She seems to be trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother appears to be enough.
It looks as though she is turning around and Lohan is missing a slap in her ears..
Under tears, the actress then asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps the cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.

British Conservative Party Congress
Watch the Tories Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The Party Congress is supposed to focus on foreign policy, trade, and development, but the quarrel between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, overshadows the four-day conference.
Referendum for a New State Name
Macedonia ’ s (right) and Greece ’ s foreign ministers have already agreed.
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.

Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil ’ s presidential election, the country ’ s mood is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.

Audi: Dieselgate takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force is still in place," said Peter Mertens, Head of Development of the "Automobile Week".,,,,,,, and.
Rupert Stadler, the detained and certified Audi chief, announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations are expected to be tested," he said then.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in tackling the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler ’ s future on Friday and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the frauds of exhaust gases have been reported.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot, Managing Director of Sales, is in charge of the company as Chief Executive Officer of the Commission.
Due to the changeover to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption test standard, there were production losses at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronner Stimme".
Basically, he sees a drop in demand for limousines such as the A6, A7 and A8 Audi models produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already had 15,000 reservations.
Grindel Wants Reelection - Lahm Wants to the DFB Board
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for the position of DFB President again despite his criticism of his person following the World Cup and the Austrian affair next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest at the ZDF's "Aktuellen Sportstudio" on early Sunday morning.
We have to keep on trying to re-election, and I will do so.
And then you have to look at whether the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "want to work on the project for the future" after winning the European Football Championship in 2024.
Grindel has been head of the Association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who overthrew the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, Philipp Lahm, the future EU chief organiser, is to work on the DFB board.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau were to agree that he would continue to consult the Bureau in this role and then of course be invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair surrounding the photographs of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a non-migrant national player should become DFB integration ambassadors.
At present, this office is held by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If anyone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and on football and says' the subject is important, we have to look after it ', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration must work,' said Grindel.

Basketball Bundesliga: Clear Start Order for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started with a significant victory in the new season of the basketball league.
The runner-up against Science City Jena won 112: 55 (52: 31) without any problems and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berlin team with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 meters), who was committed from Ludwigsburg, showed an appealing performance ahead of 9113 spectators in his debut.
Former Master Brose Bamberg won the debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis 84: 80 (39: 37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best shooter with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 meters.
Last year's Playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83: 76 (41: 34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the best contender in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a definite success.
There was a clear 100: 64 (48: 30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings dominated the Oldenburgers with 25 meters.
The Braunschweiger, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been a majority owner since the start of the season, was disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26: 1 run of the baskets quickly created clear conditions.
Erdoğan Opens the Mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening address, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite followers of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to crack down on Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were in operation, including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is criticized for being an extension of the Turkish Government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Secrets of Terror.:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have campaigned for greater commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in New York ’ s Central Park.
"You are committed wherever you can," Mendes said in front of some 60,0000 spectators at the festival on Sunday.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I am nervous, I sweat, but it is okay, because I am here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations, and aid organisations, also appeared on the stage for several hours.
In the meantime, however, there was a second of horror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shooting, fearing and trying to flee.
Shortly panic arose, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin reassured the people from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available on the Internet free of charge as every year.
Anyone who wanted to grab one had to read and distribute on the Internet texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was jubilation and applause from the audience - boosting the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, along with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke in the US Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge, upsetting many women.
At least three women have raised charges of abuse, including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he refuses.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women who, according to their own accounts, experienced sexual assault, confronted him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.
"You can also meet me at any time in an elevator," Flake said to the audience at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the Press: Federal Government Defends Rauswurf the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended a journalist ’ s robbery at the press conference of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had a t-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freiheit für Journalisten" and had gone into the front row.
The t-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a question of disrupting the running of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has caused a great deal of unrest, which is unacceptable.
That is why he has led people to take the man out.
Seibert said that it is not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor's office.
This applies entirely irrespective of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying or of supporting or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
Turkey ’ s leaders blame the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are not sure of the Turkish authorities either: only in early September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
We have to look at this twice: yes, that really is Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is known for moist conversations at the bar of the Hamburg dock "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests with a lot of beer, some wine or even more sophisticated drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory songs.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "Der geilste Tag".
However, the trip to the far north was not good at Munich.
On Saturday he made a selfless post - his face is completely shattered, the eyes are only two small slits.
The bed fever shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful cat.
He sent some insights to his fans, probably not entirely serious, that he has now won: "Rule one: go NIE to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black sauce.
And injection.
And the round Eierlikör, which squeezes Ina at half three, also leaves..
Alcohol consumption is a fact of life for the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted some tips to combat the aftermath.
They consisted of instant brewing, fish rolls, or perhaps the most appropriate headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the view of the normally attractive cinema bar.
How Ina Müller survived the nightly suction bench is not yet known.
As she has moderated the TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be more experienced...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa Fights Vandalism and Distress
The access to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle track in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and wasted.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are scarcely apparent.
Sherbs, cigarette dumps, rubbish and debris, demolished dustbins and meanwhile dismantled signposts - this has been the starting point for a long time with a seat group to the cycle path on the Haessen Hill in Treysa.
For the flagship railway bike trail in the Rotkäppchenland a more than disgraceful sight.
The topic has occupied members of the ADFC district group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the bike traffic officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the Bicycle Advisory Council.
There is no solution.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seat group to the regular discharge of waste containers and the cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible other activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the local council.
It is not only the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebrations at weekends.
Not only does it sound often, but it also destroys the joints: upwards from the ground, dustbins demolished, signs turned over, seat furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are just the proverbial drop in the ocean.
You are annoyed that the resting place at the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for sauna camps.
"Along the entire cycle path there is a clear focus here on the Haaße-hill", confirms the cyclist, who now also cares about the new cyclist in goat grove, which is being opened today.
'If it suffers the same fate, it will be very expensive '.
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "This may set the threshold significantly higher to grab public property.
However, this would presuppose that a police strike would be passed quickly.
In principle, Wüstenhagen would like to see the Haaße hill developed.
It must be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path so far can be very satisfied.
Tourism marketing is still capable of expansion.
Our cycle path is of very high quality compared to others in Germany ", says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation on Ascheröder Street in Treysa.
There is no bend trail on Haaße Hill.
In the case of frequent traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow, "she explains.
This would not be a problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake.
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in collaboration.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Stadtteiloffensive Hiltrup, in the "Musikcontest für große und kleine, junge und erfahrene Musiker".
A contest "with winks in the friendly Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family partnership with coffee and cake from the Honorary Office of the Cultural Centre.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long night performer living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What were the textures associated with?
The Hiltruper Lake and the Market avenue were particularly mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his striking song to the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Time and again we were talking about living together in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short breaks of rebuilding with short interviews with the artists or references to their work.
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now also teach guitar.
From the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke was able to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest.
Meanwhile Alvin Jasic has placed a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others could also listen to their songs.
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his help drummer, who impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children once again played at the final - and even without electronic support, as Franke said, "really good".
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, intransigence of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event a complete success.
All are "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the play sheet
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
There is a screen for each page, including four cards with keywords, which can only be deciphered - the old trick with the red slide - once inserted.
This ensures that the other side cannot read by mistake.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance".
2.
3. Dice.
4. Feast '.
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
It is not the terms that should be guessed here, but codes.
In turn, one player per team is the encoder.
He gets a code card, which might contain "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" it is not the terms behind the secret film but their encryption codes that should be recommended. are.. are,,,,,,,,,,,,
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice", "feast" and "windows" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and if possible the opponent team does not, because that will win the game if he can break the code twice.
So the encryption notes and reads out loud: "Werfen" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to feast; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prague" because he has looked up at school and knows the windowsill there.
So we go round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can better reconcile them with any reference the encryption person gives there.
Maybe mysterious, but not to turn off the conversions should be, otherwise you will make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rulebook.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time before they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But anyone who has started will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
However, "Decrypto" is not as conclusive as the predecessor and genre prism "Codenames", which is also an agency game that puts fewer words on a game but is much better to play in small groups.
And those who are only talking about rates and not winning points can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler's greeting and harasss guests in the pub.
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspectorate Kulmbach twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed Hitler's greeting in the upper town of a passing police strike, then later he also fell in a pub in the upper town when he harassed other guests.
After being considerably alcoholic, he had to spend the night at the police inspectorate in Kulmbach in the prison cell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In a sober state, he must also take criminal responsibility for using the marks of unconstitutional organisations.
The Pressig factory Home of the Sh
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers burst, one heard them all over Pressig," Georg Dinkel recalls, archiving the history of the place and the train station.
That did not inspire anyone.
The brakes quit and the wagons cracked.
That was pure railways.
Speeches that symbolize Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railways.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-Bergstrecke to the north, which has its crossroads in Steinbach am Wald after an increase of about 220 metres.
In order to cope with this, trains and drawers that had their home in Pressig were previously needed.
In 1901, the Bavarian Parliament approved the construction of a railway plant with 21 locomotives, apprenticeship workshop, steering and railway mastery.
"The centerpiece was the turnstile, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railroad.
The railway company's headquarters (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - northern half.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for train and rail blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weights were still in place per month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were abandoned, and in 1991 the rest of the plant was abandoned.
Heidrich: 'It is a pity that we did not envisage better use of the site, including with regard to freight transport'.
At Pfingsten in 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous railway festival in Pressig on the anniversary of "50 years of electrification in Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig Range Railway Station was.
Dinkel recalls, "The Rangiers and Hemmschuhleger did the most difficult work in train traffic.
Any failure would have had fatal consequences.
Why the train station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places, and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund won the second round of the Beijing Tennis Tournament, just as Julia Görges did before.
Kerber wins the China Open 6: 2, 6: 2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the third world ranking is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Victory led 6: 3, 4: 2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian number 13 surrendered.
The weak get to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened at the weekend as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss".
With great relief registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windplay Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the Tourist Association "Rund um Walberla" in the context of the series "Art and enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large amount of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann greeted the artists at the opening of the Vernissage.
He himself has been present since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in tried and tested young hands with a good future perspective.
In the past, both actively participated in the selection of artists and helped shape flyers.
This year again, on the occasion of Art & Genuss, there is a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Dance Betzn", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high level of support for the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical setting.
While walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "Windplay Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is expected on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully provided with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes.
The sun in the background shines through the bush work and makes the object look fairytale and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate himself to the event 15 years of K & G in three-dimensional letters, comes from Eckental.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
On the half way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "Der Wind das himmlische Kind".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful imaginative structure made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windplay Performance" for the enjoyment of the senses through the multi-faceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachts: Singers celebrate 50th birthday.
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the night-time ones, too, gave way to their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they dubbed the MGV 68 albums.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It gets full today," Chairman Jürgen Holstiege suspected, and he should keep right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albacht singers.
For their anniversary, they had revived the Foundation Festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
The traditional festival was back on time for the 50th anniversary.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high class Derby against BW Aasee.
The uprising marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite right in league three.
No trace of shudder or snuff, the independents do their thing.
And this at 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"This was not crystal clear, but we have already made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied trainer.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied '.
In the evening at an evening of Ronja de Boer ’ s birthday, the mood was good, the game was choked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third sentence the guests had a sentence.
"If they bring this into the goal, such a game can kick once", Büring knows from years of experience.
After all, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and brought the full yield to its goal.
"We all know who is on the other side in such a derby.
That does not break our genius.
I saw good volleyball in stages ", Annacker did not hit the 0: 3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
After just three days of play, the journey for the independents does not seem to be foreseeable.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an unbelievably good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball, "but they no longer want to turn their gaze down into the fourth league anyway.
If the West is not polluted in the next few weeks, they must look up.
However, an initial balance sheet can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.

Her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband.
Heide Keller became a star on the "dream ship".
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series might have been complicit in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went away forever.
The series, which made her star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world with a suitcase alone, and many of my admired colleagues experienced me on an equal footing, "says Keller in conversation with the" picture on Sunday ".
At first she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
For now, the journalists are only calling Heide Keller.
'I do not know if he liked it so well '.
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been envious, but "how many men did Hans shy away from talking about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried to be the only right thing for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in plain English: I have hired myself, 'as she further explains.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman, which in reality I never was, even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever ".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid it could go wrong a second time".
The day before the funeral I sat in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it work with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love then "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively ".
The night falter that regularly explores the night life of the city in the NZZ resort Zurich has dared to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our Falter is not a motif, but a little light-hearted.
And the bright shine in which a green carpet is plunged on the hexagonal square overlooks it.
But it ’ s just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So he torches over the square this late Thursday evening to make himself easier in the "Aquaclean-WC Oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the needy establishment on the ground floor of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to evaporate a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, the men ’ s oasis smells into heaven for some reason.
So out here, over to the other side of the street: Charmed guests who entertained the opening film "Green Book" right next door to the cinema at the very best level are celebrating the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: all over the world, as we know, the works on display come from all over the world.
What do you have to think of when you make an article about this festival in order not to fall into the trap of advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The wrist binds itself a belt around the feelers, which has put a good fairy on him, and two bullish doormen really wave him in generously.
Inside, the performers rush to live music far after midnight, or can be set by DJ rhythms to which they scream each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite appetizers.
In the delicatessen shop in the souterrain oysters wait for slippery mouths, next to which the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut and a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The wrist studies the shield on the escalator: "wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If this is two separate instructions, he will have lost himself in the dressing code.
But it is more a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
On the upper floor, poultry dumps a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", in line with the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not come at the price of the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been campaigning for this brand for years, is not here this evening either.
But, between local romance, Kassentisch and kitchen articles, there is a face passing that the observer knows: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character is probably not far away.
And really: Right now Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd with soon sixty almost acting like a choir.
It is not tarnished, it is not made, at most it is stolen.
It is precisely for this reluctance, often misunderstood as incomprehensibility, that international stars love this festival.
Maradona celebrates Mexico ’ s Victory with Cumbia Dances
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona is pleased to have won his team.
Argentina ’ s soccer legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home, Mexico.
After a 2: 0 victory by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57 year old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia Rythmen, as shown in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second league defeated Leones Negros with 2: 0 on Saturday.
After the game Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my guys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send after last minute failure "destroyed on the ground".
Swen Bieletzki, Coach of the Handball-Verbandsligist ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "So a bitter defeat".
As in Steinhagen and Hüllhorst, they did not play badly over long periods, the Sendeners.
Only the initial phase "we slept completely", the ASV trainer was annoyed.
The landlords quickly ran at 8: 1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not yield at first.
"Then suddenly a rush went through the team," summarized Bieletzki's second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the backlog was only two goals.
In particular, Senden ’ s Best, Marius Hintze, met again and again in the phase.
After the change it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst was running for 15: 15, then the relay changer almost invariably.
Four minutes before the siren the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Get the impartial involved.
Bieletzki is usually wary of blaming others.
But: The 120 seconds penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received was "a joke."
LIT had laughed well and met four times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys fought terribly, in the back they also stood well against seven men and threw them onto the empty gate again and again.
But they can buy little for compliments.
"Now a damned victory has to be achieved," says Bieletzki.
ASV Gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Missed for 30 years - Police Tombs after corpses
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (District Court), the police are looking for the women's remains.
On Saturday, the forces of the armed forces found a road at Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road surface and several strata were removed, as police and prosecutors jointly announced.
According to new evidence, the missing persons may not have been buried far from where they were.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Department of the Court, together with the public prosecutor's office, has, according to the data, been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators found a sensation beneath the road by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials bordered the job to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the billionaire company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) raised an extrajudicial dispute over misleading Twitter messages, in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk resigns as Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of Germany ’ s chairman.
He may remain CEO.
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct in the comparison, which must be confirmed by a court.
The SEC had sued the world ’ s well-known manager before the US federal court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk ’ s No Debt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he might take the company off the stock market, paying $420 per share, and that the funding was secured.
In total, Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion.
Later, Musk ruined: Tesla stayed on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an external chairman, hire two independent board members, and set up a committee to monitor Musk ’ s communications.

Surveys: 46% do not want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
After the squabbles of the last few weeks, the GroKo is collecting several low-impact surveys.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD overtook the SPD for the first time in the Emnig Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday throughout Germany.
In a weekly poll conducted by the Opinion Research Institute, the AfD increases by one meter to 17 percent, the SPD scores one point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27%.
That is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15%, the left 11%, and the FDP 10%.
According to Emnid, if federal elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties of the SPD, the CDU, and the CSU would receive only 43% of the vote.
As a result, the grand coalition has now lost the majority on the Sunday issue in all the major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
Governing parties consistently vote for 43 to 45% (Allensbach: 51%).
In the 2017 general election, they received 53.4%.
The bandwidth is also large among the other parties: the AfD, the second-largest party in several polls, stands at 15-18%.
The Greens reach 12.5% to 17% of the vote.
The left stands at an average of 10%, the FDP at 9%.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3% up and down, depending on the share of votes.
But popular support for German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also declined significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48% of citizens believe that Merkel is the right person in the chancellor ’ s office, as the Emnig poll on behalf of BamS found.
Only one in two (50%), according to the poll, currently wants the grand coalition to hold in three years ’ time by the next regular federal election; 41% are in favour of a new election.
A further poll published on Saturday showed a significant decline in Merkel ’ s popularity.
The Germans also judge whether Merkel should stand again for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
In the case of the Union's supporters, 64% would like to have a candidate, 35% would not.
Outside Aldi: Price Reduction for Love
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic stories to know - Aldi should talk about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" through Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a meeting place for the great love almost radiates an anachronistic romance.
Yes, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxershort bargains at the barbecue or the favourite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The App Tinder is reputed to be a slippery stock exchange rather than a contact stock.
We dared the test: How do women react, not to be long talked about in the first news?
Here is the astonishing result.
Regular Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood scene has potential if love is preceded by an out-of-eye and rediscovered plot.
If the guy also reports to his loved ones under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch @ gmx.de, then this sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this Annonce in a branch of Aldi unknown to us is to wish that she will find her dream with whom she briefly talked about the "30% reduced organic turkey meat".
She certainly deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood for her belief in the magic of analogue acquaintance.

Football: Reus and Zorc Calm for Gods
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about shape and fitness by Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That is not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us any good, "said the Götze friend Reus after the 4: 2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.

Football: District League: Explorers appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine makes courage.
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard with his hands.
He gave his name to Wortkarg, the coach of the soccer club club VfL Wolbeck, retreated (internally) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it runs around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer Beleg ist das 1: 1 am Sonntag gegen den SC Altenrheine, in der vergangenen Spielzeit nur hauchdünn am Aufstieg vorbeigeschrappt.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We have made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
"Fetsch praised his boys and looked up for each individual to say" thank you "for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
After 26 minutes the coach had to change the system.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly passed into a 4-2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his departure (17), the changed Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the lead.
This would almost have happened when the SCA, in minute 41, twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer jumped up dangerously in front of the Wolbeck caste - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his field.
After the break the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters fell short.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes entry.
With the intervention of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left missed another fresh cell show.
When Altenrhein Chris Naberbäumer pulled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, 18 metres before the guest house, there was an indirect free shot for the placeholders.
The Gefoulte himself stepped up and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhues "Thing with the right slip struck in the lower left from the shooter's point of view - 1: 0 (71).
20 minutes, which should be damned long.
And then: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather unhappily in the penal area in the 80th minute.
Judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately showed the point.
Jannis Schneider could not escape the gift (79.).
Bange minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase before Geske had the victory on the pocket in the 87th minute of 12 meters.
Would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Reh), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - The.

Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on corporate boards of directors.,,, and.,,,,,,,,
This means that only 8% of the boards of directors were female on the deadline of 1 September, as indicated in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was previously presented to the German Press Agency.
"Companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass by them," said Founding Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom, or Sweden, purely male management teams - with few exceptions - are far from conceivable. are.,,,,,,,, and. are
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different business culture.
Furthermore, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is due solely to positive impulses in the companies of the index of medium sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure stood at 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on boards of directors.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero per cent".
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 more women and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If you recruit as many women for boards of directors every year, you would have achieved 40% in 2023," says the report.
Some even make miese: luxury cars: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves best.

On Saturday afternoon, the 46-year-old driver of the emergency hospital had passed a red light and Martinshorn.
He then met on a crossing with the taxi that drove at green.
After the collision, the physician threw a traffic light mast and a tree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He then captured the passant who died at the scene of the accident.
Drivers of the Emergency Medicine and Taxi Driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the emergency vehicle driver were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from the forces.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called emergency doctor tried to do so - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn Public Prosecutor, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we tirelessly.
Manchester United lost in the 7th round of the league after the disgraceful end of the league.
ManU is subject to West Ham United 1: 3. The manner of defeat is likely to be.
The scene was sensuous in the 74th minute in which Marko Arnautovic shot 3: 1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly brought the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all defenders of Manchester remained standing, and Arnautovic let all the time in the world pass the ball by helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative culmination of what had previously been largely inadequate performance.
The mood at United ’ s Manchester City rivals is very different.
The Citizens, trained by Mourinho ’ s great rival Pep Guardiola, won Brighton & Hove Albion an approximate 2: 0 victory.
After half an hour Raheem Sterling broke the defensive barrier for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer Table Leaders
Three days after the 1: 2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1: 1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the cup out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man at the Londoners.
The 25th minute hit of the 27-year-old remained the only hit in the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who entered the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the match after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds started the week with an impeccable record, Chelsea was not defeated for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp ’ s team in the Cup, with Remis in the League toppling the blues Liverpool.
Like City, the two London clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2: 0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, who played Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from County Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unhappily bumped Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil took the decision with his third season match.
Arsenal passed Watford after the fifth consecutive victory and is now in fifth place just behind the great rival Tottenham. A strong impression continues to be given to the uprising Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
In the second round, the Wolves lost against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and finished 8th.
Volkswagen ’ s core brand is missing: Paris ’ s Diesel Debate Car Salon
The Paris Automobilsalon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject but omnipresent: the diesel scandal and the fight for driving bans and retrofitting should not be left to the German car companies at the Paris Industry Meeting.
From next week at the 2018 Motor Show, they will show their innovations together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
Diesel no longer plays a major role in this.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, should nevertheless be an important topic, at least behind the shining scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models included: The e-tron of the Ingolstadt is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
But both were officially presented.
BMW ’ s iNext will not start until 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3 Series.
More than 250 exhibitors will be present this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than a million visitors came.
The severe earthquakes and the following tsunami killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake was 5.9 and the second was 7.4.
Communication and transport links have been damaged and material damage has been caused.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach in the coastal town of Palu.
There is a fear that the number of victims will continue to rise significantly.
The figures are only from Palu.
It also affects many other communities along Sulawesis's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl.
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated on Sunday with a helper team the final divine service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Protestant Church of Westphalia and therefore responsible for the southerly concerns of the PS-strong two-cyclists.
Between April and September the traditional MoGo service takes place on the last Sunday of a month at Haus Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers met there on Sunday to perform a service that was anything but normal.
As early as 10 o ’ clock, the bolds were up in front of the entrance gate of the church.
At first the biker loblobe was on the programme and it was possible to fortify itself with coffee and cake or even with a good curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, there were also the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon held during the Biker service parish priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical entertainment.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill ’ s tone is more poetic and calm," says pastor Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle services yesterday.
Fechtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big party: After the apple comes the milk.
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and gradually demonstrated to his astonishing spectators the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could have imagined how to turn this into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to take a look at this important step at this late Friday afternoon.
In forms packed and wrapped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple layer for layer, which looks a bit like a debris.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the farmer ’ s fechtorfer also had pre-filled specialties.
He opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather white to older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
Parents were able to talk in a cosy atmosphere, while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press, but also discovered the erected chimney for themselves.
Also active members of the Fechtorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged themselves during the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games.
In the coming year, the Heimatverein will also offer an action day.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out, the home in the heart of the Spargeldorf will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also clear on the basis of the subject: after all, it will be all about milk.
1: 4 versus Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season bust: "Beschissene Situation".
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered together his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, there were many positive things to be seen at the 1: 4 (0: 2) last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a tough situation, but you have to get out as a team," said 96-footballer Pirmin Schwegler and went on to say, "This is disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot of action".
The more victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86) joined, are at the bottom with two meters and are a descent candidate in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59) and Luka Jovic (89) achieved the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who scored seven points in the middle of the table after the successful general test for the European League match against Lazio Rome.
Croatia ’ s vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of Hessen during his start debut and never got under control from Hanover ’ s defenses.
The striker, long troubled after the World Cup, showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
Alongside Rebic, the Brazilian Allan borrowed from the FC Liverpool was also the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which began to grow.
A headball of Lucas Torró (17.), adulterated onto the net of the gates, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position, was stopped at the last moment by the 96 defensive against Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back).
Leadership for the carers fell almost inevitably and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defensive corner into the penalty room, Haller prolonged per head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only had to stop the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga meeting for the defender who came in summer from the French second league player AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt performed before the break.
This time Haller adapted to his Sturmpartner Rebic, who skilfully danced through and left Michael Esser no chance.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now made a bit more brave progress, but sparking ideas remained until the end, when the finishing line was still successful.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a short hour Rebic started a solo and then placed right on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only running for the Frankfurt people against overcrowded guests, Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaian Square becomes a party mile.
Wouldn't it be nice to have a drink at the Oktoberfest in the city center.!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Violent Christians Celebrate Holy Cross Feast
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on 14 September or Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross church and the final one.
The Holy Cross Church houses the fired Christ from the Thirty Years War on which, according to legend, a Swedish soldier was shot.
Blood flowed from the gunwound.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the Shrine of Christ, which led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
It has not been completed until today, only the altarpiece stands, the missing long house is hinted by the trees.
In his sermon, pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish, the worship service was poorly attended.
After the worship the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the Cruciended.
For many years now, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty meals as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice.
In the afternoon, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger offered guided tours around the city church. On behalf of the parish, they informed visitors about the damage to the facade, the roof, the sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more specifically.
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has also been discovered, which has only been made possible by scaffolding.
Socket plastering works have been completed, natural stone works are to be started before winter and we hope to be able to complete half of these works this year.
Inauguration: New Home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße.
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home in Münsterblick Street for people with disabilities.
The fact that in Münsterblick Street "a very special house" is now being handed over to his appointment - everyone was agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the home of the life aid Donau-Iller for some time already depend on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader took into account broader corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and accessibility for all areas.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former US Army officer ’ s building was put on the test bench for the residents with a handycap: “The house had come into the years and was no longer up to date in terms of equipment, ” said Bader retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators moved to dismantle the house.
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel at home in it, according to the architect.
Donau-Iller Opens New Home
About EUR 4.6 million was invested in the new building.
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million, while the district of Schwaben contributed EUR 450000.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The splitting between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction method was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, the head of the social administration of Swabia, said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need resources to be mobile".
Kreutmayer said that living and functionality were well combined.
And again: "The plot in this location is a real stroke of luck because it can no longer be purchased in the current situation".
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblick Street offers space for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three living groups on almost 1500 square meters.
Heinz, CEO of life aid, is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by collective bargaining.
Germany ’ s Swede laments East-West Differences
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, Deputy SPD Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept discrimination against East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences, "said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania," Sunday's miracle ".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that, on average, East Germany worked longer than the people of West Germany, but that it would receive 15% less pay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I can't explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this putty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one year old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, some one year old, already reached their recipients on Thursday.
Thus they passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feed in order to "facilitate the assimilation" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced its friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
In doing so, both countries also agreed to join forces in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games, and to work together to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
As Kim approached each other, he also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri missile test facility.
Austria ’ s Moving History in Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
On the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for nearly ten months this year, numerous new books have been published, which answer this question mostly in retrospect to the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general manager of the Austrian State Archive, makes a very different point in the magnificent picture book Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New Week, New Opportunity for Government
Back to the subject matter, that is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition, which is beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, the SPD and also from the CSU did not last mantra the "return to factual work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working people in that country to ask the legitimate question of what the difference is between work and work, but so be it.
Now that the federal government is ready to return to its mission - governance - it should not be stopped by talking about concepts.
Monday will probably show whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties will meet for the coalition committee.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all this dispute.
First of all, however, the issue of diesel upgrades and the law on the migration of skilled labour is once again the subject of conflict.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with exchange-rate premiums, while the SPD and CDU see manufacturers as obliged to retrofit older diesel engines.
While the diesel crisis has seen an approximation over the weekend, the EU and the SPD are still far apart from the proposed legislation on skilled labour migration.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is calling for a perspective for those who have not received asylum, who are working or are training.
The Union is firmly opposed to the 'change of track' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be otherwise?
It was not the same thing that joined forces to form the GroKo, but three partners, some of them with very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society characterised by such diverse and sometimes conflicting interests is not progressing.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be re-established for party-political reasons on the question of being or.
It is still a matter of politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD are to argue, but always bear in mind the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the track change issue can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
That, above all, is what the People's Party must now fight for.
Pilz Checks Working Time at Hartinger
Minister in Vision
Does the Minister for Employment in particular violate the law of service in force?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" their legalists had been working on social security reform, a lavish Social Minister reported when they presented it two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is astonished - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question.
She assumes that 'the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and never to declare infringements of current service rights before cameras'.
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to 'free from any suspicion'.
Police Rides a Street in Search of Women ’ s Equ
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The course is closed until Monday in the Marxgreen area.
It was assumed that the investigators had previously set up an archaeology store.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, was able to limit the relevant position to a few metres in several times.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the supreme Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the above-road.
For more than a year now, prosecutors and criminal police department Hof have been dealing with the missing person.
Time and again, a cycle path was closed at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago Heike's body might have been buried.
Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia ’ s Anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the disputed independence referendum in Catalonia.
But riots are already occurring.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1, 2017, separatist and police clashes took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence campaigners with, among other things, paint powders to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 officials from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police forces wanted to honour their colleagues who were in action last year in the polling stations in the referendum that was deemed illegal.
Violence had also occurred at the time in trying to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep separatist demonstrations and the central security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6000 or so separatists would then have been violent in trying to break the police chain and, among other things, threw the officials with colour bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested, 24 more were slightly injured, and the authorities were invoked.
Monday is the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under coercion in the fall of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also resigned abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers from the then regional government and other activists from the separatist movement remain in underground detention.
New elections had been held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan Government took office in May, the forced administration was brought to an end.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the 'right to self-determination' of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Versammelte Ratlosigkeit: FC Gütersloh und RW Ahlen trennen sich torlos.
Red and white Ahlen continues on the spot.
FC Gütersloh also won a 0: 0 draw.
The rear lights and the third final turned out to be a jolly joke before 438 spectators in the Heidewald stadium.
The first half was scarcely manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who would prefer to have a beer or a bratwurst could do so safely.
There was no risk of missing a chance of goalkeeper, because there were virtually none.
First Shot After Half an Hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and, in principle, the only real - possibility was for the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the border.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
For him, Sinan Aygün had to be exchanged due to.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters narrowly targeted over the housing and after an hour, the Gütersloher also appeared offensive for the first time.
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz it was fixed.
The swiftly presented account about Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a small shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a Wieckowicz headball (66th) after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA Interimstrainer Angelo Daut reacted, initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It did nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahlener did not succeed.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did it.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: 'I like the fact that we played at zero', but unfortunately the zero was in the front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against woodwind and although our opponent had no desire to play here," stated RW Ahlens Interimstrainer.
Offensively, "everything so called a bit" against a team that only wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not feel that we could get a countertor, "Daut said.
But, to his grief, spectators did not feel that his team could score a goal.
The idea was too weak for this.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers.
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Board of Directors, for whom these donations are intended, are delighted.
The volunteers assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky was shining blue, but the space was still a little empty, but that should change during the day.
Because, "Here it is so nice sociable, that's why we are here today," said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus greeted the guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper touch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who was supposed to be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer quickly jumped in.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" could not be taken to entertain the increasing number of visitors in between.
This was so good that at the late hour some folk songs were sung.
"Simply great", Marcel Kreimer was delighted.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to include the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased about the many active people with their stands, mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a table," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those in use at the booths and also included the other celebrations and the "Clean up" action that took place in September.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful painting - here you can do something.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd took the Maikranz with the help of the fire brigade and brought it to the winter quarters.
Many stands were used for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heartfelt everything was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decorative saw.
He offered veneer work, beer lid with reckenfelder motifs and much more.
Three Reckenfelder beekeepers offered a specialty: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought with them by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a speciality in it.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cake.
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to linger for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage programme that is not available at the autumn festival.
Lubricants with a local political message: No successful advertising for skating equipment
In Lengerich, unknown people have scarcely promoted the construction of a skatepark.
In several places there are corresponding lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne of the City Council on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been prosecuted for damage to property.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" on signs, among others, at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, Manager of the Halle, reports that a corresponding letter has already been discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro after the trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with a edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, that was back, this time sprayed up," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special feature of this particular case is the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skatepark is built, the realisation of the skatepark will also be made possible by sponsors.
There have already been commitments, says Jörg Hesselmann of the municipal sector of education, sport and culture, without mentioning names.
However, it may well be that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the scaled table.
Local politics and administration have been working on the subject of skating for years.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the majority of the Council was in favour of the fire-fighting car park.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors seem to have spoken out against construction at this point.
At the end of June, a U-turn followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School premises.
Jürgen Kohne says, as things stand, that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The city council then has the last word.
It is based on a decision this year so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Air traffic congestion is getting worse.
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no sign of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm," said the chief of the trade union of air traffic control, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the many delays and flight failures is the long-known shortage of European air traffic control personnel, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained pilots is empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, around one hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic City, representatives of the federal government, countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports meet on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, this will not happen without us," explained the head of the GdF, who has many members of the German Air Safety Agency.
Maas once again blamed EU Commission regulations for the plight of pilots.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting costs and personnel savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully integrated into the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations which "do not cut off the air even further".
At the moment, the EU ’ s targets would be agreed by 2024, and there are fears of further tightening.
The EU has been subject to constant pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sowed in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high costs of airline delays will lead to a change of thinking.
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if the German Air Force (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
The record of 120 pilotage buyers per year over the next five years, which has been announced so far, is just enough to compensate for age-related reductions.
The need to build up staff is not linked to this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Consolidated Renewal
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to Thyssenkrupp interim director Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at the meeting on Sunday, the critical group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies should be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no further reduction in staff than we already know of cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the control panel on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and suppliers.
Barcelona: Violence at demos of police and Catalan supporters of independence.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan pro-independence activists in Barcelona resulted in violent clashes with many injured.
According to the city administration, around 3000 police from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 pro-independence protesters.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protests from each other with a big bang.
According to the forces, however, advocates of independence repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked officials with colour and shooting.
According to the data, there were also rankings among the participants in the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who, almost exactly one year ago, had opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Civil Guard find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn far more than they earn.
The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona, of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and to celebrate the fact that they spoiled us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, dismissed the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, had "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne Allowed Access to Personal Data of British Ministers
A safety gap in a mobile phone app meant that on Saturday, the personal data of ministers and Conservative Tory Party MPs were temporarily accessible to everyone.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the breakdown became known one day before the Tory Party Congress in Birmingham.
Two People stuck on B217

Football: Juve trainers praise Ronaldos best game.
The Portuguese star player "played the best match this evening together with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3: 1 (1: 1) victory of the record master against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the prize-winning star, even without his own goal, was the decisive man in the important game against the chase.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo ’ s three goal templates, Juve shot the game after the early lap through the hit of Dries Mertens (10 minute) and suspended the hardest chase for the time being.
The Torjäger, who was brought by Real Madrid, first set up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26th / 49th).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by a headball, did the preliminary work for the hit of defender Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who just had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
However, Allegri also wants to see the gates of the attacker, who is the record defender in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach asked.
Best Juve Torturer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than EUR 100 million, Juventus ’ overpower seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games in the series A. At 21 points, the master of the last seven years already has six points ahead of Naples.
The second table, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the seat of Mario Rui (58), who had already been warned, the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to get too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the place.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also able to feel this mentioned.
The German national player has won Juve.
The FC Liverpool professional was in use in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the championship league match against Valencia, which Allegri meant "half an hour": Ronaldo had flown out of the course at the 2: 0 tournament victory and was closed for the home match against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday.
Kanye West Changes its Name
Rapper Kanye West made a particularly bizarre appearance at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his performance together with Lil Pump in a bottom-water costume caused eyebrows and question marks among viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name on time for the release of his new album., the., the,.,,,,,,
From now on, it may only be called "Ye", according to the musician.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in the words of the late singer Prince when he surrendered his artist name.
But the pseudonym is not news.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you ", according to Rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Enough!
Hoetmars coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game today.
The opponent was easier to handle, we almost never faced him with problems ".
Grade by two chances of goal in 90 minutes, so you can rarely design games positively.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage, the first but used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early guided tour (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preparatory work by Krause he moved away.
The hosts had only a double option when Moritz Höne first failed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and found his master in the sequel Jan Blome in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (59) all awarded.
In addition, Niklas Eilmann could not use a trade metre - Louis Kortenjann had rescued with his hand on the line of the gate and saw red for that - (75).
It was only when Nils Berheide stoned the ball over the line that the match was decided (81).
"We had criticised ourselves hard beforehand, that was different today than in recent weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0: 1 Krause (7), 0: 2 Berheide (81).
Red card: Kortenjann (75 / Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle Football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3: 4.
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We didn't get any access to them at all", he presumably meant the wing-pinch with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites who performed with a collective offensive urge.
He was still laughing: "A dirty victory," he said, sniffed and pulled from his players the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Remember, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely albums, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class content.
With understandably mixed feelings GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0: 2, how we stand against one of the top teams of the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal".
This makes it all the more bitter that you have to drive home with empty hands.
Top Torhunter Lars Zymner led the host with his 12th season match (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He put the 2: 0 on the left side as a model for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can ’ t get rid of such a player completely.
"That was madness what he did," Lewandowski envied the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf struck the balance: McGills Freistoß sailed from the left between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe to the long Toreck (45).
After the side change it was McGill who scored the match again (59).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crunchy, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked albums again (64), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann turned out (69).
Despite the large number, Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Shadows is what we must win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Tore: 1: 0 Zymner (24), 2: 0 Fröhning (39.), 2: 1 McGill (45.), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 Nübel (64.), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow Red: Atalan (74. / Albacht).
Football: TSV Strasberg Fights Primus
There were no winners in the Bundesliga duel between the TSV Strasberg and the FV Biberach.

Media: General Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, Dynamo Dresden has resigned from the presidency of the second football club.
In the evening, several media were unanimous in calling for a joint letter from the Saxony Board.
A confirmation of the association was not available initially.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany, Politics, Not Pomp

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent Guests and New Offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France ’ s president, Emmanuel Macron, has signaled his desire to collect the Tolerance Prize personally in Tutzing.
The term was too short for Christian Wulff: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing ’ s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was there.
This is how Udo Hahn, the director of the academy, expected him when he proudly said: "All German presidents and chancellors were already with us".
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective. On September 29, the writer Frido Mann will attend a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France ’ s president, Emmanuel Macron, has pledged to receive the Academy ’ s “Tolerance Prize ” personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives TV presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings until mid-2019 have it in their own right.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
'And to a meeting on Syria: 'barbarism without limit'.
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war derides every human idea '.
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitization.
Academic Director Hahn was convinced that "a free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to seek solutions, or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200.
Birthday of Karl Marx is expected by some more visitors of the direction of the critique of capitalism, others more of a tendency "from the left to the center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100% a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said head of study Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100% neutral".
Musikkabarett: Gender understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret singer, Teubner imagined gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else might exist, but also with music.
The mini guitar used it and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks up to the end of the sentence, and on the other he is a true pianist: as congenially harmonically accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
This was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, in the way it suited the theme of the evening.
There was a paradox in Teubner ’ s play: happiness comes from man when he has a partner, but she doesn ’ t open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, will not benefit.
The piano soloist now demonstrates the same thing: What would have come out of composing Mozart had "the Nannerl" opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus Süverkrüp glides over into improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart's g-minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and bravo from the whole Chamber.
Flowers were presented by Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
However, the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not be relieved of any additional thanks.
She had the idea of giving the duo one in Wolbeck as well as appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police corrected the number of victims slightly downwards.
10 passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
Everyone has now been released from hospital.

On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus was transported frontal without any braking.
Handball: Damen-Landesliga: Ahlener SG retains the white waistcoat against TV Wattenscheid.!
The ancestors had problems with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"Actually I was happy with the defense, only one player did too many goals.
We have not got to grips with them, "says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
This time, his team missed the concentration in the final.
The ASG therefore went almost to the end behind a backlog, was behind the break at 11: 12 and later at 15: 18 (45).
It was only towards the end that the broader bank of the hosts had a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu placed the back of Merle Klement on the left side, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Bushheads, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top match at VC Allbau Essen.
Thanks to a top performance in the top match, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At VC Allbau Essen the Blau-Weißen won 3: 1.
"This was a giant step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the league.
This is what we have done, "coach Dominik Münch was pleased to see his team perform almost impeccably at the overthrown table leader.
The guests dominated the first passage almost at will.
Over 4: 1, 16: 10, and 22: 12, he went to the runner-up of the previous year at 25: 15.
Essen was accepted in the two-pronged seal but did not come into play.
We did it well.
Our adversary was at great risk, but he also produced a number of tickets.,,,, and.,,,.,,
In the second sentence the BSV already led at 12: 8. "Essen has converted its acceptance to triples.
We were unable to keep the pressure on the service.
Food was sucked and we were lulled a bit, "Münch continued.
At 18: 17, the first volleyball players from the Ruhr region had their nose ahead.
Although Ostbevern resisted four records at 19: 24, the fifth attempt was his goal.
"The game was now a class better", the tutor was at an increasing level.
Maike Rüdingloh and, finally, Wiebke Silge, played a major role in ensuring that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: 'We played consistently and calmly'.
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13 the Blue White pass four with 25: 22 brought to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Municipality: Opening a mosque as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne left behind a shaft in German-Turkish relations, which can only be tediously swept together," said the chairman of TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the opportunity to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing, side by side with German leaders, Muslims ’ affiliation with Germany, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," said Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has' reinforced many reservations'.
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself.
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff-Time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 pm the Heimatverein Nottuln already hosts its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the Kaminzimmer der Alten Amtmannei.
It is almost a year since we had a torture meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our Folk Meeting would be so fast in Nottuln.
No matter if Stormtief Friederike in January or heatwave in July, the Amtmannei Kaminzimmer was always full.
"The programme at the next Folktreff is as always a colourful mixture of German folk, hikers and sailors, folksongs, evergreens and old drums", says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friendly musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his accordion for the first folk meeting "Birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from neighbouring Steinfurt that played music with platinum German texts.
Now he is on the road with an Irish folk band.
The folktreff ’ s makers would like to recall the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song “Frösche im Nacht ”, enthused the audience and sent home with an earmum.
"We expect a lot of cheerful guests to spend a social and humorous evening once again", says the invitation of the Heimatverein.
Those who play an instrument and want to participate actively are invited to participate.
As the coveted seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but entrance is already at 7 p.m.
China ’ s Approved Merger of Linde and Prax
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step towards becoming the world ’ s largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that authorisations in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the US are still pending for the multi-billion merger.
Most recently, the chances of an insider agreeing had improved, because Linde promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From Fruit to Ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the horticultural and regional nursing district was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit show in Kulmbach ’ s Vereinshaus was the last start-up impulse for the district association for horticulture and regional care in Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle.
In 1893 he was baptized by mayor Wilhelm Flessa.
The purpose of the fruit growers' association was different from today's work - in fact, it was purely about fruit growing, about flowers and horticulture no one thought at that time.
"At that time, in the Age of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees should be along long-distance roads, and so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
Fruit growing is still the job of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village decoration and nutrition play as much a role as providing knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Maulwürfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said District Chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge issue for us children, and I doubt that smartphone & Co will be able to gather a similar amount of joy.!!!!!!!!!!!!
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with councillor Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides", supplemented councillor Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county left no doubt about this.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the circle and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for winter it was dosed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the commercial garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature has endured, it was here before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," said the expert for fruit and nut trees.
That is why the gardening associations are encouraged not to let go, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
The President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl, supplemented this by welcoming the new citizens to our clubs.
"We have to stop the glaring decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the towers of the music association Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta Talks: Canada ’ s Secretary of State Moves UN Speech
Mexico ’ s government wants clarity about the nafta: it gives both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada ’ s Secretary of State now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement – and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Canada ’ s Secretary of State, Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York, owing to time pressure in the struggle for a new North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico.
Instead of speaking this Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly only on Monday, her spokesperson, Adam Austen, informed us.
Meanwhile, they are focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
On Friday, the Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, declared that Canada and the US negotiators had 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August to recast the Nafta regional free-trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They are now to be finalized by Sunday evening (local time); Trump ’ s administration wants to submit the deal to the US Senate before October 1.
If the negotiations fail, Mexico ’ s President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a trade show attack, left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, following a report from the newspaper "O Globo".
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform in public in the South American country last week before the presidential election.
The politician had been attacked on the open streets in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations in particular called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations mobilized against Bolsonaro ’ s racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers ’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand.
Brazil ’ s presidential election is on October 7.
Haddad, a former mayor of the metropolitan city of São Paulo, has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but now presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round, there will be a run-off on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from it - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is well known for harassing homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again, he is shocked by verbal derailments.
On another occasion, he said that supporters of Lula ’ s left-wing Workers ’ Party should be shot.

After Long Disease: Danish Rock-Legende Dead
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen informed Larsen on his website.
On the deathbed Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician had been under treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become famous with the band Gasolin ', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band was dissolved in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the most sold album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen honored Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a 'street boy' who was' against everything but in all hearts'.
The head of government also reminded us that in 2010, the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared at the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rocknacht in the Shoe Factory: Volume of pressure hammer level
The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" simply describe the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pur by three bands with a friend.
After the soundcheck and just before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and its surroundings - all together with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands vocify the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" -Rocknacht.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band will perform in a harmonious and powerful manner.
Although "Admittance" calls are not to be missed, "Tiger Bonesaw" then left the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that Hardrock is not the same hardrock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock from the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is also used at "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar.
Not only the longing, ball-loving "Take Me Home" captivates by the change of melodic passages to the gitar-loaded rockriffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, however, has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
On Saturday, the band presents their hardrock with full agility.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with her appearances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
In cooperation with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo while he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is of course a part of this kind of hardrock concert: The Mint Mosquito - Rocknacht, according to the information of the mixing desk team, lies at around 98 decibels at the three-volume concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition".
This is about pressure hammer level, but is therefore clearly below the "Wacken-Fesitval", the "The Ignition" on its website.
Ear-stunned 120 decibel in nozzle level, as usual in the annual Metal-Stelldichein in the north of the republic, the Ahlener audience does not need this rocknight.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky Gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saws and lit a concert table with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say at the end, albeit in a figurative sense.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A Sailplane Death at Essen / Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Essen Airport.
A glider plane crashed on Sunday at a car park at Mülheim / Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim / Essen Airport.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider plane had crashed at the airport's exhibition park.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" reports, the student was alone on board - the pilot is supposed to be a one-seater.
The aircraft was already landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance away from a tent on the airport grounds.
But an October festival has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim / Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr counties and directly at the access to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park & Ride offer for large events at the Essen Exhibition Centre or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump blames Kim: "And then we fell in love."
It is no secret that US President Kim, North Korea ’ s leader, is well-disposed despite the nuclear crisis.
But Trump has now made a real declaration of love for his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim ’ s “beautiful letters. ”
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has committed himself to a new flame.
The tragedy: it is a distant relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in West Virginia, Trump found almost timid words for the half-year-old Pyongyang dynasty ’ s ruling dynasty, even though the struggle for North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament turns out to be rather tough.
"I was tough, he was, and between us," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it is not only talks with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote wonderful letters to me, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump has referred to the Kim announcement that all nuclear and missile tests will be stopped, even if critics so far pay little more than lip service to them.
The US president seemed well aware that affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" – Trump ’ s nickname for Kim – of his Martial threatening gesture might not be affectionate to everyone.
In any case, when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is this?
That is so unpresidential.
But don ’ t care much about it, Trump declared, and put his finger on the crowd: “I have always told you, it ’ s so easy to be presidential. ”
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there pushing into this bumpy arena; we would only have 200 people out.
October Festival attracts many guests to Baesweiler.
Baesweiler visited the best, atmospheric as well as pampered by the sun: very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre was cleaned out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not just take place in the party tent at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Saving Refugees from Libyan Prison Video
Nigerian refugees, using a cell phone video, have pointed to their disastrous detention conditions in Libya, enabling them to be rescued.
In July, the group shot the recording in its cell in the coastal town of Sawija, risking their lives, and it distributed online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in an attempt to enter Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger of life according.
One of his comrades was almost beaten to death by the staff, Onyeka said.
In general, the prison conditions were disastrous: 'They beat us all with pipes and sticks'.
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organising the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Approximately 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been returned to their homes this year with the help of the program, said the IOM spokesperson in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of Libya ’ s poor prison conditions.
But he didn't hear about a call for help from a mobile phone video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libya ’ s refugee camps as degrading.
The North African state, largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the village on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 4.50 p.m. the teacher entered the building above the main entrance.
In the anteroom of the first floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the foreground.
The teacher informed the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.
Description: About 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark t-shirt.
Please refer to the police inspectorate Obernberg am Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days.
A 75 year old man had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in central Franconia after he drove the car away from all forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
On Saturday afternoon, rescue forces discovered the car by accident near a pasture and freed the missing person since Tuesday evening, the police informed him on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was, according to the data, in good health despite the cold nights and the long period.
He said he would look forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported as missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a trip with his 4x4 vehicle across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive searches, the man ’ s whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet Calls on the Rule of Law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own.
The two countries ’ relations are currently “overshadowed, ” Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns, in particular, waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
So he made it clear to Erdogan that, if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important precondition for this.
Laschet also referred, according to his own data, to the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then reaffirmed the independence of Turkey ’ s judiciary.
Laschet ’ s and Erdogan ’ s conversation had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence ’ s readiness to fly at Cologne ’ s airport in the short.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn, but the owners of the castle rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel after the conversation to open the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
However, he said: 'The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country'.
We are also their interlocutors - and not the Turkish President.
North Korea ’ s Demand for Disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the gains in negotiations on North Korea ’ s denuclearization, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea ’ s Secretary of State, Ri Yong Ho, accused the US government in the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The recent gridlock comes because the US relies on coercive measures that kill confidence building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament would be unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
The fact that punitive measures could 'bring North Korea to its knees' is' a dream of people who do not know us'.
In order to build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear testing facility, Ri emphasised.
However, the US side did not react to this, the Minister criticized it.
Last year alone, because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council adopted three times sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have pressed the United Nations in recent days for strict compliance with the sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea ’ s leader, Kim Jong-un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will return to Pyongyang for talks about ending North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with community donations.
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors to the house of the open door HoT got nothing of it: white blankets and flower jewellery on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the harvest service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was funded by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank them for their food.
The launch with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the bad surprise came on the first day after the summer break: a power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from scratch: we have had a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so everyone wrapped up.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"You can't do better", a visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served, or guests were allowed to use quiz, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said pastor Frank Beckmann, while wizard Stephan Lammen was astonished with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board of Directors NRW of the Board of.
Out of frustration with criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has surrendered his post in the National Association.
Sartor was known throughout Germany because the Essen Tafel had introduced a ban on admission to foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice president of the NRW boards, Sartor said to the "World on Sunday".
There are too many in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, expressed sympathy to the dpa for the decision of his long-term deputy.
Sartor took the harsh criticism with him.
"I can follow his move - people have said that they did not know exactly why the Essen table did this".
However, Sartor is still active for the Essen Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes", says Weilerswist.
Sartor once again criticized colleagues from other panels in the "World on Sunday".
We should not take the approach of 'without us the people of the city are starving'.
It is up to the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essen people did not attend a conference of panels on Friday in Berlin.
"There is too much sweet jewellery told me," he said.
There are all the social fuzzi that criticised me at the time.
SF Lorch Lose 2: 0 Leadership - Gmünder Day Post

Gladbach Plays Twin Leadership - Schalke ohne Embolo mit ersten Sieg
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2: 2 the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke wins the first season against Mainz (1: 0).
In the first five league games, Schalke played four times with early opponents.
Now Domenico Tedesco ’ s team has once again demonstrated the strength with which it took the first place in the last season behind Bavaria.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after a great deal of preliminary work by Jewgeni Konopljanka, and the hosts subsequently conserved the mini-pad with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an exceptional comeback, Borussia Dortmund is greeting from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had a 0: 2 lag against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half came to a 4: 2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (59.) with Douwithin four, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, brought another in the final (86 / 94)..
The first victory was also the VfB Stuttgart.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters had to fear against the Werder Bremen, decimated by a yellow red card against Milos Veljkovic before the break.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious disposable owner, which helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not have a successful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who performed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, twice gave a lead, played 2: 2 and still waited for a victory in the VW City since 2003.
Wolfsburg ’ s 1: 1 compensation was awarded to Renato Steffen with his second Bundesligator.
At the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, just like at the second counterpoint after one hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite devastating.
Alassane Pléa is becoming a goalkeeper in the foals storm.

After seven rounds, Gladbach takes fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the hitherto unbeaten Werder Bremen was manoeuvrable against the VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgarter Konter, which the ex--Luganesi Anastasios Donis concluded with his first season match, and after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serbe got after a jersey match against Daniel Didavi Yellow.
Although Stuttgart ’ s defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen back into the game with a curious disposable owner (68), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the overcrowded Stuttgart back onto the winning road.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3: 0.
After half an hour Hanno Behrens put the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia today, some 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change the name of their country in Northern Macedonia.
With a yes vote, the nearly three-decade conflict with Greece ’ s neighbor could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on changing its name because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any rapprochement between Macedonia and the West.
Voters thus also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that it would be able to join NATO quickly if the referendum had been positive.
Syrians in U-jail.
Refugees attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beaten up three pensioners, sometimes seriously hurting them.
The 41-year-old asylum seekers had ridden at about 10 p.m. on Friday in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they appealed to the accused, who started with concentrated fists on passers-by and tried to attack them, to his behavior.
The Syrians then tried to beat the officials and step down.
Shortly thereafter, it turned out that the suspect had knocked down three older women (65, 67, 75) with his fists at a tram stop in the currency street.
He also trampled the trio with his feet.
Some pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered haematology, beatings and brain shocks.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured 'for unknown cause', as the police said.
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday the two of them gave their backing in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered life partnership was not in question for them.
"If we marry, then right," he has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman for the SPD Bundestag Group and one of the spokespersons for the Seeheimer district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag ’ s debate on opening marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had stirred up anger on June 30, 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "disengaged".
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples, like heterosexuals, have been able to marry.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the case of adoption law.
Garden Day: 400 m hedges cut.
There was a lot of work to be done in front of the members of the Citizens' Association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
Around 400 metres of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it was put in place for around twelve supporters.
"We do this in order to reduce costs," explained the chairman of the citizens' association Walter Schröer.
And so much has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a form cut.
After all, the hecks were already shot in the spring.
The breakfast, which is always followed, has a long tradition.
"After all, everyone should be able to do their best," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner gets Gold at the Canuslalom World Cup
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Kanuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
On Sunday, the 29-year-old placed a perfect run on the Olympic circuit.
Two years ago he missed Olympic bronze by three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, I had enough rides here on the site and it has checked everything today, "said the London third Olympic Games in 2012.
In the goal, he threw away his paddle from joy and spread both arms more victorious - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not beat his 89.69 second fable time.
The second became the Czechs Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspection reports the first attempt at burglary this autumn in a detached house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days will be shorter - burglars want to take advantage of this again.
For example, the Gauting police inspectorate reported yesterday the first attempt at this autumn's collapse.
The alarm system is responsible for the fact that it remained on Königswieser Straße during the attempt at the single-family house.
They started when the perpetrators held their hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the inhabitants were not at home.
But the alarm seemed to surprise her so much that she escaped without prey.
Note to the PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Hertha ’ s Fail: The Reality of Bavaria versus Ajax
The prediction is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin will "not let go".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance model under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase for the Munich people to a larger autumn low.
"A week ago we still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we have a bit of a reality, "said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0: 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us will know that we are annoyed by this and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal has been shot abroad, like at the same time of the previous season two mandatory games in series without victory, the table management in the football league lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
While the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its intensive Mann-gegen-Mann-Taktik and the Berliner by its playful needle stitch over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, just like the most recently overpowering Bavarians are bound to crack.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," said Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly soft with his losers in his birthplace, postponing his first defeat as Munich coach merely for the again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim summary of his term of office positive before the country break - otherwise the tone will probably get worse.
For example, Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second premier class appearance of this season after the 2: 0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, the short preparation for the second round against Ajax begins as planned, which had 3: 0 at the of AAthens.
"Now we have caught up in two games, but we are going to play again," said national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly.
The legal defender appeared as a reminder.
"I don't think that all this is bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes behind it," said the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavarians were already behind Dortmund with five meters, which has now taken the lead again with one point.
And so Kimmich valued at least positively, with a wink, that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
For the league, it is already good.
DFB-bosses in Shot Line: Özil-Causa: Erdogan ’ s sharp attack on Grindel
With severe accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new item is to be created.
Berlin - On various stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the power of interpretation in Mesut Özil, a long-standing issue.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the former World Champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB head of government defended the association line.
In the early Sunday morning, the Grindel in Mainz's ZDF "Sportstudio", which Özil personally strongly attacked, announced consequences from the Causa.
"In future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U teams - we must draw very close conclusions that this kind of thing will not happen again," said the 57-year-old, who wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration supervisor.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not support the values of football and the DFB.
In harsh terms, he denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England, "Erdogan said on Saturday in the Cathedral City.
In all honesty, as its President, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who were up to the German national team, were marginalised.
Grindel referred to Gündogan ’ s statement that, unlike Özil, he felt “sensibly treated by the DFB ” after the World Cup affair, which began with photographs of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, as I have always said.
However, he does not see any basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration commissioner will be appointed next to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If anyone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," The issue is important, we must take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration must work," Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Austrian affair, he intends to stand again next year as DFB president.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as possible," Grindel said.
Three accidents per year in three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As police reports, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
First the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
He told the pensioner that he was driving against their car.
There was no exchange of staff because the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the car park.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had departed from the road and travelled against a post.
To this end, the man did not want a local police force and then drove away.
Afterwards the Roman travelled home.
However, in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, the pensioner has gone through the process and, when he turns, has rammed a building vehicle.
After all, the police could find and stop him.
His car suffered significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much more.
The damage is approximately EUR 1300.
Moor fire in Meppen: Almost 1000 troops still in use.
Approximately four weeks after the outbreak of the moorfire on a German defence site in the Emsland region, 980 workers are still employed in the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the German Armed Forces on Sunday.

It was then said on Thursday that the fire was no longer threatening to spread to neighbouring communities.
At times, more than 1500 people tried to control the large fire on site.
The air force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones from the German Armed Forces.
According to the German Armed Forces, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are planned for 2 and 5 October.

On Monday, the German Armed Forces will set up a contact point to receive claims for damages.
The first claims for compensation had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.

Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples, like heterosexuals, have been able to marry.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the case of adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia on new names
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should in future be called North Macedonia.
This is because of its northern province of the same name, neighbouring Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO.
If citizens vote in favour, they will also be launching the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The Author who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting

Switzerland Launches Electronic Register of Organ Donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members of stress situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be taken only with explicit consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland launches an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members of stress situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved if Swisstransplant is required.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be extracted only with explicit consent, as in Germany, emphasises Swisstransplant.
According to Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation, 15 percent of Swiss people are expected to have a donor card.
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment for potential donors.
In more than 60% of the talks, relatives do not know the deceased ’ s desire.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," he says.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations of storing information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as Marita Völker-Albert, spokesperson for the Federal Centre for Health Education, says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
German Minister for Health Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be regarded as organ donors, unless he or she contradicts his or her family.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old pupil is World Champion in Capitalism
Tomohiro Iseda, a 14-year-old student from Japan, is world champion in headcount.
He won against 39 competitors in Wolfsburg last weekend.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, announced this Sunday.
Wenzel Grüß from Germany, aged 16, took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a 12-year-old Japanese pupil, the oldest of a 74 year old French pensioner, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans competing.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were present two years ago when he was 14 years old in Bielefeld.
With terms like superbrain, genius or miracle child, organiser Laue can do little.
"Head-count can be trained," he said.
Many participants practised several hours a day.
There are even stadium-oriented computing competitions in India or Singapore.
One of the disciplines is, for example, the movement of square roots from six figures.
In terms of versatility, candidates are given surprising tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The main referee said that the Germans would also have a good chance of doing so.
Otherwise, Asians are often advantageous, because they learn headcount more intensively and with other, effective methods as early as childhood.
Impressive appeal: video with naked Serena Williams: It is about breast cancer screening.
Tennis Ass Serena Williams shows off her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to point out breast cancer and promote early detection.
It is about life and death, but it is also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only their hands hide their most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died from this.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which deals with breast cancer screening, which can save lives.
Serena Williams himself would have died almost a year ago.
There were complications when her daughter Alexis Olympia was born.
An emergency operation was initiated to save the baby's life.
A subsequent CT detected blood clumps in Serena ’ s lungs.

Polar Cold Air brings fresh snow to the West.
Ms. Holle is shaking out her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week falls to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it could snowfall to about 1,000 meters, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern Mountains, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher-altitude pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road) the road conditions become winter.
Farmers are allowed to start annual sticking on Monday.
Schleswig-Holstein ’ s farmers are allowed to start the annual sticking on Monday.
The "green ramparts", unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the Welsh state for about 200 years.
The tree and stud hecks, which are up to five metres wide, are "forest substitute" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks Are Living Fences
The Knicks were founded in 1766 on the orders of the Danish king Christian VI, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitation and cattle fences, they also supplied firewood and beams to the farmers for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" comes from that time: by "changing" the branches could develop the dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, around 45 000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a woody, multifaceted landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a replacement habitat by some 7,000 species.
In one kilometre of Knick, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 bird pairs.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, it will shrink into a bright series of trees that, apart from biodiversity, will also lose the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, crumbling is permitted only outside the breeding season from October to March.
After the tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia, talk about SItuation on the ground
In an interview with the German editorial network (RND), the local Radia Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta at that time on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport in Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that supplies can also be imported.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our World Vision office has also been destroyed, but we have set up something provisionally where we have accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have gone to surrounding hills, where they are still stuck for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some people are standing in front of their homes and there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and petrol stations are completely closed, people sometimes take food and petrol.
The public service has been shut down completely and the national government is helping.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners are going around freely and finding them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information on the island run?
At the moment we have a mobile phone registration, but before that it didn't work and we only got information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who do not know if they are living and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes but, for example, at work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions not hit by the tsunami, there has been misinformation that a tsunami is hitting the region, and that they are heading for the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Firering not prepared for earthquakes?
But, there are earthquakes every day, but that was the worst here.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuation.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a great many people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has long waived Aogo and Donis.
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
On Saturday, Aogo took a muscle fiber drink in the back left thigh against Werder Bremen. The German Bundesligist announced on Sunday.
At Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option towards Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games after the following country break.
VfB Stuttgart did not make a forecast at the downtime.
A muscle bundle usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber sweetener usually heals a little faster.

However, the action went on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers on the Olchinger Lake noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the water guard station.

Biathlet Julian Eberhard peilt World Cup medal
Biathlet Julian Eberhard was in the stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the medal close to being grasped.
Seven tenths of a second were missing on bronze.
"I have consciously taken the time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it simply did not want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to return to a major event, to win something with the constitution.
At some point, you have to strike.
The world championship run in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard: "The track I have already closed to the heart," he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup course in the previous year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass launch competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
He went to second place in the season in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Survey at Turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a very thin majority for the contested judge, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been contested by charges of nullification.
President Donald Trump has given investigators a deadline of Friday to investigate the suspected incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The recent turnaround in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh ’ s appeal, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the jurist issued angry tirades against opposition democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative Supreme Court judge.
The Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but called for an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who still referred to the serious reproaches on Thursday as' shake ', initially refrained from further attacks on women and, on the contrary, said' happiness in disaster '.
In this way, last doubts could be resolved, he said.
Later, in an election rally, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply, rejecting Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump Orders FBI Investigation in Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
They will specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, no more, a government representative said to the Wall Street Journal: 'They do not go on a fishing trip'.
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality of Ried, the mobile radar unit installed in a "civil vehicle" for monitoring the speed limit will be stationed on the Gartenstraße from Monday 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 ’ s Victory Against Mainz
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
However, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball inside.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room, "said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the Königsblaue had managed to complete the scarce 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first season victory.
In fact, things could have changed.
After the leadership by Alessandro Creator 11 of the team of chief trainer Domenico Tedesco assured Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing".
No Headball Monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours", Heidel said: "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that".
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore to withdraw further and further.
And with man and mouse defends against Mainz.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We have all fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Creator, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hitter: "I am actually the worst headball player in the team".
But in the end only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including, of course, at Tedesco.
"We wanted to make a good start in the initial phase and make a firework out of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
Victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to play games over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest shortcoming in the afternoon: Royal Blue missed it, rather to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59th / 72 or Amine Harit 62.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then it would not have been a victory for quotation," Tedesco said: "You have already felt fear a little".
I am therefore pleased that we have won.
He was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Rauchsäule in Leitzachtal 2 km visible.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on equal terms.
In front of them is the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has again followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfeld Meeting" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Cultural Policy" in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gesture, solid figures and some jokes, he brings one of the most conflict-ridden themes to the audience: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are conflicts increasingly arising?
The Syrian lame author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at the same table, with first-generation migrants at the catchment table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit around the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat around the table and now want to play their part.
This leads to conflict.
It is not, therefore, whether one is politically right-wing or left-wing, but rather: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
Initially rather behaving, then the discussion round is getting more and more busy.
And there is a need for talk. is. is.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizing that he talks about the average, not individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the signing session, he was also able to listen to the questions of the guests and also to discuss them intensively in the foyer with prepared Kurdish specialities.

Schalke's Naldo "Great Sport" succeeds at the Bank.
For the third time in succession not in the Startelf: Nevertheless Naldo thanks Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf but on the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the nearly two metre tall Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when, as usual, the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1: 0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and the chief coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for the sake of simplicity, entered and said: 'We have to thank, trainers!'
"That was very emotional, it was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed existence as a reservist, had no resentment.
Problích knows that Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best Schalker, did not actually get on his trainer's lap - but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It was not easy to tell him that.
"It was not easy to tell him that, I tell you quite honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he said to Naldo that he was not in the starter elf.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it is always about the matter, it is about the association ", Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bavaria and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can go through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation that last hit Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by being an exemplary team player at the bank.
Austrian industry ’ s mood accelerated its decline relative to the eurozone in August.
The purchasing management index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Across Europe, Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone ’ s PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index remains below the 50 meter mark for the 13th consecutive month.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
At the bottom were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France, and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but slower than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points at the highest level since March.
"The slightly diluted decline may well mean that the worst is over," Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
But industry remains the number one growth brake - at least in the third quarter.
There is no prospect of a rapid return to the growth zone: export orders in the eurozone have plummeted as much as they have since November 2011.
The companies therefore closed positions for the seventh consecutive month.
In China, too, industrial production declined more in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing management index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are being raised.
