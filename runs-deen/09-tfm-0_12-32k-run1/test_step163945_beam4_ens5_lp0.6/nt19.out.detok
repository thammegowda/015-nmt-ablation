DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that naturally depends on coming into the conversation, that one also speaks to him about why he felt one or another apparently as laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the soccer podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the picture newspaper.
Despite the monthly debate over Özil ’ s photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he deplores the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have liked Mesut Özil to have continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that would be the case, "said Grindel.
The 29-year-old explained his resignation from the DFB team in July, justifying that Grindel did not defend him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared for a meeting with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build any pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "one leaves a team or a club changes, that one talks to his coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung brannte
At 2.13 p.m., the vocational fire brigade Linz was alarmed at a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly through the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in default.
The professional fire rifle recovered and found the hut in full-fire at the entrance..
The roof had to be virtually completely removed and fire-rubbing was absolutely necessary.
According to owners of the burning garden-hut he had hired a battery to store at midday.
This may be the cause of the fire.
In any case, the charger, according to the fire brigade, was in the area of the greatest intensity of fire.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined, as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable because the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Wütende Mutter wehrt sich: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What has Lindsay Lohan only driven to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to take away children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself confessed live how she apparently wants to tease a family in Moscow.
The report reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial section of the stream.
Here you can see "Zum Glück geküsst" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see Lohan coming out of a car and going to a homeless family that wants to have them out of Syria as a refugee family.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan persecutes parents and their children.
It accuses adults of child trafficking.
For all this, it does not provide evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this just", Lohan is listening in the video as she follows the family further along the road.
Apparently she tries to separate the children from her parents.
Eventually, however, it seems that the obviously angry mother is enough.
It looks as if it turns around and Lohan fits a slap.
The actress is fired under tears as she is shocked - and she holds the cheek.
What Lohan has led to this action is currently completely unclear.

Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned.
"The Diesel-Taskforce is still there," said development leader Peter Mertens, the industry magazine "Automobilwoche".
The detained and certified Audi CEO Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would be dissolved soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations are likely to be checked," he said then.
Mertens said: 'At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in the recovery of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was established in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens pointed out that the car manufacturer had made 'serious organisational changes' so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler ’ s future on Friday and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of allowing the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after acquaintance with the exhaust emissions fraud.
He knew or deliberately ignored the manipulations.
Bram Schot currently heads the company as Commissarischer CEO.
Due to the changeover to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there are production failures at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronner Stimme".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment in itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already had 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm is to become the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as DFB president again next year, despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özi affair.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes," said Grindel as guest at the early Sunday morning in the "Current Sports Studio" of the ZDF.
You have to keep trying to re-elect, I will do so.
And then you have to check if the support is there.
According to his own words, "strange" if he did not "want to work on the future project after the 2024 soccer championship was awarded."
Grindel has been a follower of Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown by the summer fairytale affair since April 2016.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place on 27 September 2019 at the DFB Bundestag.
According to Grindel, Philipp Lahm, the future EMC ’ s chief organiser, is to participate in the DFB ’ s pra.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that in this role he will continue to be invited to the Bureau, and then, of course, be cordially invited to put his experience at his disposal in sporting matters," said Grindel.
Speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair surrounding the photographs of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that, in future, a national player without an immigrant background should become integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office of the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is one thing that clearly affects society and football without an immigrant background, and says," the subject is important because we must take care ", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work," Grindel said.
Halfwise Waage
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that not only measures my weight but also the body fat content.
It can also display muscle and bone mass.
The Body Mass Index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the sausages.
Says nothing about whether I have replaced fat with muscles.

Criticism of Germany

We will not allow sympathisers of the PKK or Gülen movement to hurt our citizens and hurt German-Turkish friendship, "he said.

Several thousand policemen have been deployed - including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is criticized for being an extended arm of the Turkish Government.

Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have campaigned more for poverty and disease in a joint concert at New York Central Park.
"Engagiert Euch, wo auch immer ihr nur könnt", sagte Mendes bei dem Festival in der Nacht zum Sonntag vor rund 60.0000 Zuschauern.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B joined a red outfit with Fransen and a golden microphone.
I am nervous, I sweat, but it is okay, because I am here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations, and aid agencies, were also on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a specter when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was a fear and tried to flee.
In short, panic arose, people ranted through each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musicians Chris Martin reassured people from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You are all in security.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet every year.

He spoke to his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake, in the Senate Judicial Committee, advocated the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, alienating many women.
At least three women have raised charges of abuse right up to attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects them.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into allegations after two women, who have themselves been sexually assaulted according to their own data, confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in a lift.
"You can also meet me at any time in a lift," said Flake at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends the robbery of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the turf of a journalist from Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s press conference (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had moved a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and went into the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about disrupting the progress of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has caused a great deal of unrest, which is unacceptable.
He has therefore made people's defenders take the man out.
Seibert said that it is not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This is completely independent of whether or not this is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying or support or membership of banned parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
Turkey ’ s leaders blamed the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the journalists accused threatened several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities either: only at the beginning of September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of the journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel arrested.
They were free and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey the two still go against each other.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and entertaining, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is well known for her cheerful conversations at the Theke der Hamburger Hafenkneipe Schellfischposten.
Moderator Ina Müller joins many beer, some wine or even higher-spirited drinks with her guests to tempt the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink for the obligatory vocal templates courage.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from movies like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
The Munich trip to the High North was not good at all.
On Saturday he put a fie - his face is completely crumbled, the eyes only two small slits.
The Bett-Selfie shows a completely excited Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful cater.
At his fans he wrote some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now won: "Rule one: goes NIE to Inas night.
Normally two: never trinks the black suction.
And syringe.
And the round of Eierlikör, which Ina forgets about half three, also leave away.
Alcohol consumption is truly on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans sent a few tips on how to combat the aftermath.
They were rich in instantbrosis, fish crumbs, or - presumably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves with the sight of the normally attractive cinema stage.
As Ina Müller has survived the night suction store, it has not yet been known.
Since they have moderated the TV fun at the counter but already since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more proven...
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to contend with vandalism and betrayal.
The entry into the 36 km long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tiring.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Scherben, Zigarettenkippen, Müll und Unrat, demolierte Mülleimer und mittlerweile demontierte Hinweisschilder - so präsentiert sich seit Längerem der Einstieg mit Sitzgruppe zum Radweg auf dem Haaße-Hügel in Treysa.
For the flagship project Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland a more than unbelievable sight.
The topic is occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt, but other members of the Radverkehrsbeauftragte der Stadt Ulrich Wüstenhagen have been working on this.,,,, and..
The problem has already been raised in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals range from the transfer of the seat group to regular emptying of waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities", says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been submitted to the local council.
Not only the rubbish drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for parties at weekends.
It is not only too frequent to say that the yellow is also destroyed: posts from the ground, dustbin demolished, nickten sign, seat furniture smelled.
Volunteers would have cleaned up already more frequently, narrated ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are just the proverbial drop in the ocean.
The Rastplatz on the cycling trail in Treysa is a meeting place for saufgelage.
"Along the entire cycle path, here at the Haaße Hill, there is a clear emphasis on", the traffic controller, who now also cares about the new radar station in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"Relieves them the same fate, it becomes really expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "The threshold may be significantly higher to pick up on the common good.
This would, however, presuppose that a police strike would then be timely.
In principle, Mrs Wüstenhagen wants the Haaße hill to develop.
It must be made more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the wheel path so far.
Tourist marketing is still capable of expansion.
Our cycling path is very high quality compared to other cycling routes in Germany, "said the ADFC members.
As a highly critical danger source, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no Abbiegespur on the Haaße hill.
In case of rain traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the road, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but it is a problem for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the cultural station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and co-existing.
"D ein Lied für Hiltrup" darzubieten, lautet der Appell der Stadtteiloffensive Hiltrup, im "Musikcontest für große und kleine, junge und erfahrene Musiker".
A contest with eye twists in the sympathetic Hiltruper family, as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family coexistence with coffee and cakes from the Honorary Offices of the.
Seven formations were performed, from the Ein-Mann-Band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long in Hiltrup alive Albacht, the novels of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, according to Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What did the text look like?
In places, the Hiltruper Lake and the Market alley have often been mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig arbitrary the avenue in his striking song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about the experience of coexistence in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about her work.
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
Stefan Schemmelmann, the sound technician, knew to report to Franke that the latest event in Ludwigshafen took place - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest.
And Alvin Jasic placed it on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others can also listen to their songs.
A whole CD can be Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his help drummer, who impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children entered the finals again - and even sounded good without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects originality, reference to Hiltrup, meddling in the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The city ’ s offensive had brought the event to life for its tenth anniversary.
It was a great success.
All are "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the very soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the play.
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page, there is a screen where four cards with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - only if you inserted them.
This ensures that the other side can't read anything.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Würfel.
4. "
These are the terms that must be constantly encrypted.
Because it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Changing a player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card, which is perhaps "3.4.2".
Erraten werden sollen in "Decrypto" nicht die Begriffe hinter der Geheimfolie, sondern ihre Verschlüsselungscodes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "feast" and "window" - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as not as possible; because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The encoder notes and reads aloud: "Werfen" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to feast; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prague" because he has gone to school and knows the windows there.
So it goes round for round, team for team further.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can better understand them by pointing out that the encryption is there.
Perhaps mysterious, but not to be turned off, the changeovers should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily heavy on your team.
The cryptist at "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it at length until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the net makes it easier.
But anyone who has just started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this seeming game.
However, "Decrypto" is not as coherent as predecessors and genre primmus "codenames", which is also an agent matter on a game less words stülpt, but to play much better in small groups.
And whoever it's just about rats and not about winning points, it's also easy to find a version for two..,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler's greeting and harassed guests in the pub pe
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday twice.
It was only in the Upper City that he showed a passing police strike to the Hitler pit, and later he also fell in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholised by the hurried denial of space by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must be prosecuted for the use of markings of unconstitutional organisations.
Works Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway operations in Pressig were the hub of the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffer to buffer was scarce, it was heard all over Pressig," Georg Dinkel remembers, who archives the history of the place and the station.
This did not inspire anyone.
There were also the brakes and the wagons crashed.
That was pure railways.
Statements that stand sensibly for Dinkels home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-Bergstrecke to the north, which after an increase of about 220 metres elevated its crossroads in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, earlier drawers and drawers were needed that had their homeland in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station station station with 21 locomotives, apprenticeship facilities, guidance and railway mastery.
"Herzstück was the hub that had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and for 47 years professional railway pioneer.
The railway company (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary railway lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff stock of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig.
Electrification of the 1939 line already minimized the need for drawers and drawers.
From 1977, they were only used in freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 guards were ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were dismantled, in 1991 the rest of. were. were. were.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that there has not been a better use of the site, even in terms of freight traffic, in mind".
The railway director Nuremberg celebrated the 50th anniversary of "50 Jahre Elektrifizierung Nürnberg - Saalfeld" at Pfingsten in 1989.
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here", Georg Dinkel recalls.
Not long after.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig railway station was history.
"The rangy and inhibitor learnt the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mishandling would have had fatal consequences.
Why the railway station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and there are many other historical and current pictures here in the infrankenPlus article.

A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened at the weekend as part of the art and enjoyment series.
With great relief, the organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather when in the open-air area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach, the special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened.
It takes place under the umbrella of the Tourism Association "Around Walberla" in the framework of the series "Art and enjoyment".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was demonstrated by a large audience.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
But Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago, somewhat surprisingly.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his job in tried and tested, young hands with good prospects for the future....,,,,,,,
Both have already played an active part in the selection of the artists in the past and have helped to shape Flyer.
Also this year, on the occasion of art & enjoyment, a 70-cent special brand, designed by them, is again available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high level of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical re-wiring.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful manner.
It is made of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property the visitor on the right side of the "Happy Tree" expects the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a trunk stump, coloured, playful with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes provided as a.
With the sun sweeping through the bush work in the background, the object looks marvellous and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate himself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K & G.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
On half way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful phantasy structure of sound, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for the Schlendern through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31st December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachts: singers celebrate 50th birthday festively.
In 1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachtener also made their displeasure air.
At least five of them.
They did not want partout to find that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should no longer be a Sangesleben in the district.
It has become a legend: on a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they raised the MGV 68 Albachts from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It will be full today," recalled Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albacht singers.
On the occasion of the anniversary, they had the foundation festival revived.
For years it was tradition, then there was only one break.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband.
On the "Traumschiff" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly talks that the series may have had a complicity in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series she made her star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
For I was awakened with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of me admired colleagues took me on equal terms ", said Keller in conversation with the" picture on Sunday ".
First of all, it has always been 'the wife of Hans von Borsody', but that has changed with the 'dream ship'.
For now, journalists have only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know whether he enjoyed it so much."
She thinks it is possible that her husband could have been quite envious, but "like many men Hans shy about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have hid myself ", as she further explains.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, whom I was never in truth, even if I was sometimes cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love for always is ".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could even go wrong a second time".
On the day before the official wedding I sat in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why it never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller presented the love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not ubiquitou.
I have gone to love far too naively.
This time, the night market, which regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort of Zurich, dared to meet the ZFF-opening party.
Our Falter is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the grelle shine in which a green carpet is baptized on the Sechseläutenplatz shows him over fee.
But it is film festival, there want to sunbathe more or less celebrities in the spotlight.
So he torkelt on this late Thursday evening about the place to ease in the "Aquaclean-WC oasis".
In this way, the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called: the need for a new pavilion in the park takes a lot of trouble to redesign a luxurious ambience.
In this evening, however, the ruler's oasis stinks for some reason to the sky.
So here, look at the other side of the street: invited guests who entertained in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" just at the best level, celebrate as every year the festival beginning with a party in the three-storey department store.
Dessen Name fits perfectly with this film festival: as you know, the works shown are from all over the world.
What do you have to think of when you get an article about this festival to avoid falling into the veil of its 190 partner companies?
The Falter binds itself a bench to the Fühler, which has given him a good fairy, and two bulky doormen actually wink him generously in the first place.
Drinks push the yellows, they dance far after midnight to live music or let themselves be pretended by DJ rhythms, to which they tear each other up, and rinse with Cüpli exquisite touches under.
In the Delicate Shop in the Souterrain wait oysters for sipping mint, next door the incomparable Rohschinken Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain jumps.
And the hammer is: All the sales racks are fully exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
We must love that country!
The Falter studies the shield at the escalator: "Enter a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If this has two separate instructions, it has become embroiled in the dress code.
But it is more a conditionality construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the budget division on the upper floor, the poultry poultry dumps a cocktail called "Golden Eye" prepared with espresso, suitable for the festival award.
The prize for the best drink is not necessarily given to this mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting this brand for years, is not here at night either.
But here, between local romance, cassette and kitchen articles, a face passes that the observer knows: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
The main actor should not be far away.
And really: Immediately walks Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty as soon as a chorus appears, through the crowd.
It is not appended, it is not procured, it is robbed at most.
Especially for this reluctance, liked to be misunderstood as a connotation, international stars of this film festival.

Four minutes before the siren the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Griffen the impartial into action.
Bieletzki is usually wary of looking for the blame.,..,,,,,,,,,,,,
But: The 120-day penalty, which Steffen Mühlhoff kassierte, "was a joke".
LIT had been laughing well and met up to the end still four times - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought great, and in the back of the team they have also stood against seven men and threw themselves into the empty gate.
Only can they buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damned victory has to be", says Bieletzki, who used the rest.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending call as head of the billionaire firm.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have unlawfully challenged misleading Twitter news, in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.

Musk is unaware of any guilt
Musk made it clear that he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the complaint.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written more than 22 million Twitter followers, perhaps going to take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, financing being secured.
Tesla would thus have been valued at a total of $72 billion.
Later, Musk went back: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an outsider chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk ’ s communications.

Polls: 46% do not want Merkel to become Chancellor by 2021
After the cross-matches of the past few weeks, the GroKo casks several surveys.
The SPD is falling behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has surpassed the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday.
In the weekly poll conducted by the Opinion Research Institute, the AfD is counting 17%, the SPD compares the previous week with 16%.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value to date for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15%, the left 11, and the FDP 10%.
If elections were held on Sunday, the SPD, the CDU, and the CSU would get only 43% of the vote, according to Emnid.
This means that the grand coalition has lost the majority on Sunday's question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties get up to 43% to 45% of the vote (Allensbach: 51%).
In the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4%.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, in several polls, is the second strongest party, reaching 15% to 18%.
The Greens achieve voting shares of 12.5 to 17 percent.
On average, the left is 10%, while the FDP is 9%.
For statistical reasons, such surveys vary according to the proportion of votes, uncertainty from 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) ’ s support in the population has also fallen sharply since the federal election in 2017.
At the moment, only 48% of citizens still believe that Merkel is the right person in the chancellor ’ s office, as the Emnig survey commissioned by the BamS.
Only one in two (50%), according to the poll, wants the grand coalition to hold three years of regular federal elections, 41% for a re-election.
In a poll published on Saturday, too, significant popularity losses for Merkel had been apparent.
The Germans are also judging whether Merkel should again stand for the CDU presidency in December.
47% are in favour, according to Emnid, 44% against.
So 64% of Union supporters want a candidacy, 35% do not.
Aushang bei Aldi: Preisreduziert zum Liebesglück
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says that there are no romantic Kennenlearn stories in Tinder's times - you should talk to Aldi about Putenfleisch.
Munich - In times of digital "fast-food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place of knowledge for great love almost radiates an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer hort bargains at the chilling table or the favorite pudding is still in doubt a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being not so much a contact but rather a smart stock exchange.
We dared the test: how do women react, not just in the first news to beat the bush?
Here is the amazing result.
Regularly Hollywood-Lovestory-Potential has it when the love affair is preceded by an Aus-den-Augen-verloren-und-wiedergefunden-plot.
If the type then also complains at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch @ gmx.de at his relatives, that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the creator of this Annonce in an unknown Aldi branch that they wish to find their dream husband, with whom they briefly talk about the "30% reduced bio-turkey".
She has certainly earned her Happy End à la Hollywood for her belief in the magic of the analogue connoisseur.

Football: District League: Researcher performance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrhein makes courage SC Altenrhein
There were moments in this still young season, since Alois Fetsch went to court with the ropes hard.
At the end of the war, he was forced to resign from the Bundesliga after the war.
All history.
In the meantime it runs again round the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past game time only sculpted thin on the ascent.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We have made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen ", Fetsch praised his guys and sought every individual after the match, simply" Thanks "to say for so much counter-defense against the ambitious guests.
Coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerich (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly over in a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes waited in front of front of balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more gameplay in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerich before his departure (17.), the changed Luca Rehberg (26.) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the lead..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It would have been almost the same as the SCA in minute 41, two times in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer, dangerously rising in front of the Wolbecker caste - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL mistakenly assumed full control.
Thewes failed from 18 meters.
Schroer also arrived after 58 minutes at a Thewes input too late.
With the consent of Miles Geske, Fetsch of the left again missed a haircut.
In the 70s, when Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer hailed Robin Westhues, there were 18 metres in front of the guest house an indirect push for the placeholder.
The entourage occurred and demonstrated its vulnerability to standards.
Westhues "Ding with the right snake suggested a - 1: 0 (71) from the bottom left of the shooter's view.
20 minutes, which should be damned for a.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew into the 80th minute the leather in the penalty room unhappy to hand.
Schiedsrichter Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Bange Minuten musste Wolbeck in der Schlussphase überstehen, ehe Geske in der 87. Minute aus 12 Metern doch noch den Siegtreffer auf dem Puschen hatte.
Would perhaps have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

The Allbright-Stiftung report: Women remain a rarity in company boards.
This meant that only 8% of the Board members were female on September 1, as stated in the report "The power of monoculture", which was officially presented to this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was pre-empted by the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will have to pass by them," said founder Wiebke Ankersen.
In the US, the UK, or Sweden, purely male leaders, with few exceptions, are no longer conceivable.
The backwardness makes the German competitors less diverse, more innovative and more forward-looking. the.
It is another business culture.
In addition, the slight increase in the share of women among German stock exchange companies is due solely to positive impulses at the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright data, only 6.8% of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8%.
At the 30 Dax companies - in previous years pioneers - the proportion of women stagnated.
Finally, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that next year's Dax companies will again recruit consistent women - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the proportion of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: on September 1, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Every year, recruited as many women for the boards, a share of 40% would be achieved by 2023," says the report.

A rescue trip of this kind took place in Bonn a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - At the collision of an emergency medical agent with a taxi has been fatally injured in a 26 year old pedestrian in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were seriously injured, as the police said.
On Saturday afternoon the 46-year-old driver of the emergency doctor had crossed a red light and Martinshorn.
He then came together on a cruise with the taxi that drove at Grün.

The 62 year old taxi driver and the emergency doctor's driver were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from operational forces.
The equally seriously wounded 29 years old emergency doctor could free herself, but the pedestrian could not help her any more.
He tried to do so without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the public prosecutor's office, determine who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we tirelessly
After the blamable in Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing the Premier League round 7.
Towards West Ham United is subject to ManU 1: 3. The way of defeat is likely to speak.
The scene was sensuous in the 74th minute, in which the rekindled Marko Arnautovic for West Ham had the 3: 1 shot; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they assumed an offside of Mark Nobel, all Manchester defenders remained, and Arnautovic left the world all the time to shoot the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a service that had already been insufficient over long distances.
At the moment, the mood is very different at Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City.
The Citizens trained by Mourinhos big competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion for an approximate 2: 0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team broke out for the first time.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1: 2 defeat in the league, Xherdan Shaqiri fought Liverpool in the Premier League for a 1: 1 match against Chelsea.
As with the cup, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old hit in the 25th minute remained in the final phase of the game's only match.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Besser made it Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his smuggler.
After the Reds started with a spotless record in the week, Chelsea was not beat for the second time.
First, the London team of Jürgen Klopp eliminated the blues Liverpool from the table top in the Cup, through the in league.
Like City, London City also celebrated the two city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2: 0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, who played Granit Xhaka, had to endure against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire, however, until the 81st minute on a success story.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford ’ s defender Craig Cathcart scored a Hereingabe of Alex Iwobi in his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil took the decision with his third season meeting.
Arsenal scored fifth in a row of Watford and is now in fifth place behind the big rival Tottenham. A strong impression to in under his coach, Espiri.
The Wolves remained in the league for the fifth time in a row at 2: 0 against Southampton and occupy 8th place.
VW ’ s core brand is missing: Parisian car showroom in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue, but ubiquitous: the Diesel scandal and the ring for driving bans and retrofitting are unlikely to leave the German car companies out of business in Paris.
In the 2018 car show from coming week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital their novelties.
The same thing is no longer really relevant.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the glossy scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is doing so with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and among others have their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the city of Ingolstadt is due to enter the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgarter 2019.
Officially, both have been presented.
The iNext from BMW is scheduled to start in 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3er.
Altogether, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors arrived.
In the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport links have been damaged and enormous material damage has been caused.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke across the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu hundreds had gathered on the beach to a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims will still be significantly higher.
The figures so far only come from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along Sulawesis's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for motorcyclists in the peace church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of heroes.
Werdohl - The square in front of the peace church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the farewell service for the bikers was on the programme.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and therefore responsible for the spiritual interests of the PS-strong bikers.
Between April and September the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at the house Nordhelle on the last Sunday of the month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
There, around 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to celebrate everything but ordinary worship.
As early as 10 o'clock, the Bolids were in front of the entrance of the Church.
First of all, the Biker-Frühschoppen stand on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a deft curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo-Team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The preaching was performed during the Biker service of the parish of Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical entertainment.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues-rock, Valerie Lill suggests more poetic and quiet sounds," says Pfarrer Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday.
Feast orfer home club celebrates great celebration: After the apple comes the milk milk.
Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
They served their hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Great interest also aroused Georg Hartmann-Niemerg.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his astonishing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when left Hartmann-Niemerg the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle force, a fine crushed mass was formed from the apples.
Many of the children could not imagine how to make a tasty drink.
However, these important steps were also taken at this late Friday afternoon.
In forms packed and wrapped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the slice of apple pieces, which look good as a bit like a chicken.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran after and into a big vessel.
But the farmer, too, had already completed completed specialities.
Thus he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the older visitors the latest feather white.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also the built up refuge for themselves discovered.
Also active of the Füchtorfer comradeship former soldiers committed themselves within the framework of the festival and invited at some stations to temporary games.
In the coming year the association will also offer an action day.
Then, as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out, it will not be the home in the heart of the town ’ s savings bank.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious from the subject: after all, it will be about milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with four seasons default: "Beschissene Situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter met his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 to speak to them.
There were a lot of positive things before: 1: 4 (0: 2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt but not to.
"It is an embarrassing situation, but you have to go out as a team," said 96-footballer Pirmin Schwegler and shoved to: "This is obviously disappointing, because you always take a lot before".
The more dispassionate Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86) joined, has two counters at the bottom and is a candidate for departure in its current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45. + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) achieved before 46.300 spectators the goals for the DFB Cup winner who after the successful general test for the European League match against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia ’ s vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hessen in his race debut and never got to grips with Hanover ’ s defenses.
The storms long after the World Cup showed with its speed and perseverance why it is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilians from the FC Liverpool were also the first to start the initial formation of the Frankfurt, which started in vain.
A tornet of torn headball from Lucas Torró (17th) was the first danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was replaced by Brazil ’ s Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back), in a promising position at the last moment.
The leaders of the Hausherren almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball to a fenced corner in the penalty room, Haller extended by head to the gate where Ndicka only needed to keep the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga meeting for the defender, who was bought by the French league AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt presented before the break.
This time, Haller adapted to his Sturmpartner Rebic, who snatched and left no chance for 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser.
During the half-time, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak idea of his elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a little more courageous forward, but the ideas that arose remained short before the end, when the buffer was still in operation.
They were much more efficient.
After a short hour Rebic started a solo and then put right De Guzmán, who had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurter gegen überforderte Gäste nur noch Schaulaufen, auch Jovic met a minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes the party mile.
In spite of cool temperatures, good mood prevailed at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter created it before Millionenpublikum at the opening of the 185.
Munich meadow in the last week with two shots.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christen feiern Heilig-Kreuz-Fest est
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14 or Sunday afterwards.
The religious service takes place in the church of the town, then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final part.
The Holy Cross Church houses the Christ, who dates from the Thirty Years War and is said to have shot a Swedish soldier on the legend.
The blood flowed out of the firing.
This led to a large pilgrimage to Christ, which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished to this day, only the Altarraum stands, the missing Langhaus is hinted by the trees.
In his preaching, Pfarrer reminds Adolf Buhl that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The divine service was badly attended despite the importance for the violinist Pfarrei.
After the service of God, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting a Catholic pastor to the secular part of the festival.
The choir members sent the visitors with hearty dishes as well as a large selection of cakes and the weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon the parish also offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone work and windows as well as the upcoming construction work that will drag on until next year.
After the rumour has come to an end, the damage has been more accurately identified and specific tenders prepared.
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that was already present a few years ago has increased, but more has been found, which was only made possible by the use of scaffolding.
The socket plaster works have been completed, the natural stone works are still to be started before winter and the half of this work is still to be completed this year.
inauguration: New home in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße a very special house is now handed over to its destiny - there was unanimous agreement on the inauguration date for all present.
After all, the 12 wheelchair users who have been living in the home of the life-aid Donau-Iller have been dependent on the particular architecture of the new building for some time.
Broader corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader took his concept into account.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former US Army officer building was put on the test bench for the inhabitants of Handycap: "The house had come into being for years and had ceased to function in time according to the equipment," explained Bader retro.
In 2016, the excavators crashed to tear the house down.
The new building should be designed as brightly as possible so that the inhabitants can feel at home in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new home in Iller.
Approximately EUR 4.6 million was invested in the new building.
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million, the district of Swabia EUR 450000.
According to the architect Bader, the works have remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms.
He also thanked the Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
However, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many presets that gave the inhabitants the freedom to move without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants who need tools to be mobile".
In doing so, the housing and functionality was well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The plot in this situation is a real happiness because it is so in today's situation no longer to acquire".
Altogether, the new residential home in the Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups, covering almost 1500 square meters.
We are proud to be Managing Director of Lebenshilfe Heinz at the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by collective bargaining.
Germany: Sweden laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the day of unity, the deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to be deprived of East German. the of,, and.
There are differences that after almost 30 years of unity hurt.
With these differences, we must not be content, "said Prime Minister Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on Sunday."
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that, on average, East Germany worked longer than the people of West Germany, but received 15% less pay.
"I can explain this almost 30 years after German unity no one," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this putty dog stop the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan Jagdhund is supposed to smooth the sway between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang gave the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday, the two reached about a year old dogs already their recipienon Thursday.
They then crossed the border town of Panmunjom with three kilograms of dog food to facilitate the "reconciliation" of animals.
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural asset of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship bid announced by North Korea at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korea ’ s leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries agreed to join together in the international sporting competitions, such as the 2020 Olympic Games, and jointly apply for the Olympic Games to be held in 2032.
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile engines as a result of mutual rapprochement.
Austria ’ s Moved History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has now been celebrated in this year of commemoration for almost ten months, numerous new books have appeared which answer this question mostly in retrospect to the last hundred years.
In a very different way, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive, puts it in the magnificent picture book "Austria", which will be published on October 1.
New Week, New Chance for Government
Back to factual work – that is the unofficial motto for today ’ s starting week of the Great Coalition.
Hardly any interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her CDU, SPD and also CSU ministers last summoned the "return to factual work" in some ways.
This may be the case with some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other active citizens in that country, who are entitled to the question of what is actually the difference between work and material work, but it is' s drum.
If the federal government is now ready to return to its mission of governing, it should not be discouraged from discussing concepts now.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and whims of the last few weeks may already be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the top of the governing parties come together to form a coalition committee.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, the Diesel retrofitting and the Immigration Act are once again subject to conflict-prone issues.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to be able to get away with exchanging premiums glimpsively, and SPD and CDU see manufacturers as being obliged to upgrade older diesel technology.
While a rapprochement took place in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned immigration law.
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the 'change of track' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be disputes again among coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not like and like GroKo has joined forces, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society so diverse, sometimes conflicting, does not advance.
However, in order to be constructive, dispute must not be allowed to be raised again for party tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
We are still talking about politics, not about theatre.
The Union and the SPD should fight - but always have a real view of the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel issue and the spure-change issue can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, the parties must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in Visier
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, violate the law of service in force?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night," their legalists had worked on the social security reform, reported a superficial social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ), which refers to surprise, now brings the matter to Parliament via question.
They assume that the Minister would only express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and would not wish to declare any violation of the law of service in front of the cameras in progress'.
Nevertheless, they now have questions to be able to speak of any suspicion.
Police are riding a street in search of women's equality.
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to speak.
There is now confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben will be dug.
The route is still closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday.
It was predicted that the investigators had previously used an archaeologist.
The dog, specially trained for the odor of old human bones, together with his guide, finally managed to limit the relevant position to a few metres in several cases.
In addition, a ground anomaly was discovered along with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bavarian Monument Protection Agency in the area of the said road site.
For more than a year now, prosecutors and criminals' police have been handling the case of missing persons.
Time and again, a bicycle path was closed at Marxgrün and investigated with sonars, because the investigators suspect that in the course of the reconstruction of the state road 30 years ago Heike ’ s body could have been frozen.
Colour powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, Catalonia ’ s disputed independence referendum will be the first time.
But there are already wallets.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, the centre of Barcelona saw clashes between separatists and the police.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the pro-independence, among other things, by colour powder, as they sought to prevent this from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3000 police officers at Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honour with a rally their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year in the illegal referendum.
In trying to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at at the time..,,,,,,,,,.,,,
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep separate the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces, reported Spanish media.
Some of the 6000 separatists, however, would have tried with force to break the police chain and, among other things, used colour bags and eggs to police the officials.
Six people have been arrested, 24 others have been slightly injured and the authorities have been invoked.
On Monday, for the first time, the independence referendum will be.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced rule in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians have also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in U-custody.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was ended.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the 'right to self-determination' of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Versammelte Ratlosigkeit: FC Gütersloh und RW Ahlen trennen sich torlos
Red and white ancestors continue to appear.
The FC Gütersloh also achieved only one 0: 0 draw.
The closing light and the third last puppets them in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as gathered helplessness.
The first half was manageable by the entertainment factor.
If you would rather get a beer or a bratwurst, you could do so without worrying about it.
There was no danger of missing a chance because there was practically no one.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) shot of the whole lot, Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility had the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty margin to a parade.
Even more innocuous were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel was able to reveal for the first time, at 18 meters above the housing and after an hour, the goods sloh also appeared.
After a conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz, it went fix.
In the early days of the show, Konter played on Aygün "krönte" Nick Flock (62nd) with a flashy shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they laid the Ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein after a headball from Wieckowicz (66th).
RWA-Interimstrainer Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did nothing.
More than an optical superiority thanks to his own initiative, the Ahlener did not bring about.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but also did not bring anything.
Angelo Daut made an effort to remove the positive: "I like the fact that we played at zero", but unfortunately the zero was also at the front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against wood wrapping and although our opponent had no desire to play with us," said RW Ahlens Interimstrainer.
Apparently "cheered everything so a bit" against a team, "which only wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not have the feeling that we could get a counterpart, 'Daut.
However, one did not feel as a spectator to his body as if his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too meagre for that.
Recking fields Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately, there are enough chalmers.
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle are happy to welcome these donations.
The Honorary Officers assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was shining blue, but the space was still somewhat empty, but that should change during the day.
Because: "Here it is so nice sociable, so we are here today," said a visitor.
The organiser of the Festes Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper pinch of humour.
For the couple Brockmann, which was supposed to be woven against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer sprang in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there is enough chalk.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to be entertained by musically increasing visitors.
This was so good that at the late hour some folk songs were sung.
"Just great", Marcel Kreimer was delighted.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date of this time in his schedule.
He is pleased about the many assets with their booths, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be something like a blackboard," he thanked nevertheless for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those who were at the booths and also joined the other festivities held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town is a colorful place to go.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took over the Maikranz with the help of the fire brigade and moved to the Winterquartier.
Many booths have been used for the physical well-being.
From sweetness to heart, everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, was creative in his decorative coffin.
Furnierarbeiten, Bierdeckel mit Reckenfelder Motiven und einiges mehr hatte er im Angebot.
A speciality offered three recken fields: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter still has a speciality in this.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
As the little Elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cake.
The conviviality is that the visitors stay until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Schmierereien mit lokalpolitischer Botschaft: Keine gelungene Werbung für Skateanlage anlage
In Lengerich, unknown people hardly promoted the construction of a skateboard.
Jürgen Kohne from the municipal administration will answer the question of the WN in several places.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been made against the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were written in large letters on signs, among others at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, Manager of the Hall, reports that a correspondence on the advertising shield had already been discovered on the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro after the trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently 'only' left with an edding, they could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, it was again there, this time", says Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising badge must be replaced.
A special note is given precisely this case by the fact that several large companies are also called from Lengerich on the board.
If the skateboard is built, its realization is also to be made possible by sponsors.
Promises already exist, explained Jörg Hesselmann from the urban field school, sport and culture, without naming names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the chosen board.
Local politics and administration have been dealing with skateboarding for years.
After the old one was dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the Council voted by a majority in favour of the fire-fighting site.
However, this effort has not been made - too many factors seem to have opposed the construction of this site.
A U-turn followed in late June.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously in favour of the Areal of the Gutenberg-Sch.
Jürgen Kohne says on the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the midst of concrete planning.
The last word then comes from the city council.
He proceeds from a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built around 2019.
A Worse Airpass
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm," said the head of the trade union of air traffic control, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the air summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
One important reason for the many delays and flight failures is the long-established personnel shortages in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for fully trained pilots is empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, some 100 people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that various trade unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the Federal Government, the Länder, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work condensation and overtime, this will not happen without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in the German Air Safety Association.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the Lotsen-Misere.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost and personnel savings in the national air traffic control systems are now fully integrated into the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to stand up for regulations in Brussels that do not further limit air safety.
At the moment, the EU ’ s targets would be aligned by 2024, and further tightening would be feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying from airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high costs of delay for airlines will lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if the German Air Traffic Safety Authority (DFS) offers a 'coherent training and future pact', Maas said.
The announcement of the inclusion of 120 pilotage annually over the next five years has just been enough to offset the age-related declines.
The necessary staff building is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Consolidated Financial Statements
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.

Barcelona: Violence in demos of policemen and Catalan independence advocates.
There have been violent clashes with numerous injured people in two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona.
According to the city administration, some 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 independence activists.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two lines of protest apart with a large ban.
According to the emergency forces, independence advocates tried repeatedly to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officials with paint and sausages.
According to the data, there have also been discrepancies between the participants in the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police wanted to pay tribute to their demonstration by colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, took action against the independence referendum in Catalonia, banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Civil Guard find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers are earning far more than they deserve.
The demonstrators felt it provocative that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona, of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Only to provoke and celebrate the fact that they have rushed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearics, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the charge.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year only have done their duty: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a large European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues have not come to provoke, "the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British ministers

Football: Juve-Trainer praises after top: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star crater played the best game together with the half hour of Valencia this evening, "commented Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3: 1 (1: 1) victory against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the expensive purchase of Star was also the decisive man in the important match against the persecutors without his own.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and makes it good," said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo, Juve shot the game after the early backlog by hitting Dries Mertens (10 minute) and drove the hardest fighter.
The former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26th / 49th), first put the Tory in the hands of Real Madrid.
And Ronaldo also did the groundwork for the meeting of Abwehrchef Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who just had to push the line.
"He gives many templates," commended the coach.
Of course, Allegri also wants to see Tore by the attacker, who is in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team of the Rekord-Torschütze.
"We must be even better at serving him", asked the coach.
Bester Juve-Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than EUR 100 million, the supremacy of Juventus seems even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games are the makellose series in the series A. On 21 points, the master of the past seven years already has six counters lead to Naples.
The second, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But Mario Rui (58), who had already been rejected at the latest after the reference to space, was the champion.
The Portuguese had to climb to hard ground against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the place.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turiner Coach.
Emre Can was also invited to speak.
The German national player got his way at Juve.
The Profi, which was purchased by the FC Liverpool, was used in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champion League-Partie against Valencia, who meant Allegri with the "half hour": Ronaldo was in second place: 0-victory of the Turin and is closed for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.

In an interview with the radio station KRL, the artist explained that "Ye" has religious significance for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most used word in the Bible and there it means" you ", so the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Endlich!
That is what is needed.
Hoetmars coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game today.

Grade two Torchancen in 90 minutes to make seldom games positive.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
Also the SG had only two possibilities in the first pass, but the first used mask crawl from spitzem angle to early leadership (7).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after a great deal of preparatory work by Krause he moved around freely.
The hosts had only one double opportunity as first Moritz Höne at Torsteher Jos shoemaker failed and in the aftershoe Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all gave away.
A trader - Louis Kortenjann had rescued at the gates with his hand and saw for it red - Niklas Eilmann also could not use for the guests (75).
Only when Nils Berheide secured the ball over the line was the match decided (81).
"We had been severely criticized before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," the conclusion of Florian Kraus.

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular Football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3: 4.
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We didn't get any access to them," he presumed to mean the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites that played with collective offensive urge.
But he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, was compelling and pulled by dancing players, on the other hand, the relief was noticeable that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel of two teams, one of which, Albachten, plays the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class match.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"This was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0: 2, as we keep against one of the top teams of the league throughout the game time, that was really phenomenal".
So bitter it looked that you had to go home with empty hands.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12 seasons in leadership (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2: 0 he placed on the left side mustergültig for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't smoke it all.
"This was madness, which has made" Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent neidlos.
Shortly before the change of side, his own elf succeeded in compensating: McGill ’ s release from left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through the long toreck (45.).
After the change of the page, it was McGill who achieved the balance (59).
Then it went and she went.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
After the release of their new album, the album was released in the US on May 29, 2006.
In spite of the overwhelming number, Albersloh failed to meet the last Concordia meeting (80th) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Shapdetten, that is what we must now win," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1: 0 Zymner (24), 2: 0 Fröhning (39), 2: 1 McGill (45), 2: 2 McGill (59), 3: 2 Nübel (64), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80).

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until mid-next year.
Meanwhile, France ’ s president, Emmanuel Macron, has signaled that he wants to collect the price of tolerance in Tutzing personally.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as President, he was not in Tutzing ’ s Evangelical Academy.
But before and afterwards Wulff was there to guest.
He was the director of the Academy Udo Hahn when he proudly said: "All the presidents of the Bundeskanzler and the Federal Chancellor were already with us".

Music Cabaret: Gender Communication with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Both for adults and for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner understood gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and what else there might be, but also with music.
The mini-guitar she used and also mastered her violin.
On the wing saddled Ben Süverkrüp.
One is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the conclusion of the sentence, and another is a true pianist: so congenial harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
That was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, like the Red Faden of the evening.
There, Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but he does not open the door.
A closed door without partner in contrast does not bring any benefit.
The piano soloist is now demonstrating the same thing: what would have happened to the composer of Mozart, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrüp slips into improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "song of death", and from Mozart's minor symphony into a playful dancing.
There were great applause and bravo from the full room.
Flowers handed over Karlheinz Kleintje, Treasurer of the Association, the Chansonette.
However, Heidemarie Markenbeck, the president, did not let himself be thanked.
In addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, she also had the idea of indulging in a cloud in the duo.

International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the great Ditib-Mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the Mosque in Cologne has left a shattered relationship in German-Turkish relations, which can only be swept together laboriously," said the Chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network of Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the opportunity for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Rather than highlighting the affiliation of Muslims with German leaders to Germany, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The extensive exclusion of the German public has encouraged 'many reservations'.
Home Association Nottuln: Offer has already established itself.
After the long summer break, Folktreff-Time is finally back.
On the 18th of October (Thursday) at 7.30 pm the Nottuln Association is already hosting its fifth notary Folktreff in the chamber room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost on the day it is exactly then a year ago that we performed for the first time a folktreff.
In the meantime this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln, "Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein, is pleased to welcome you.
I would not have thought that our Folktreff would have been so quick in Nottuln eta ­ bliert..,.,,,.,,,
Whether storm deep graveyard in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of Amtmannei was always full.
"The program at the next Folktreff is like always a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sea team members, folk songs, evergreens and old hits", says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friends to Nottuln.
On the first Folktreff "Birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer promised with his accordion.
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt who played music with platinum German texts.
Now he is on his way with an Irish-folk band.
Gern remembers the makers of the Folktreff to the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" excited the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We count on many happy guests to spend once again a sociable and humorous evening", it is said in the invitation of the home society.

China approved planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
Frankfurt Linde and Praxair are taking a further step on the road to the world ’ s largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority approved the planned merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This makes it even more difficult for the multi-billion-dollar merger to obtain permits in South Korea and, as the biggest hurdle, in the US.
Most recently, there had been an improvement in the chances of approval for an insider, because Linde has promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October, so that the merger can succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year anniversary of the Kreisverbands (district association for horticulture) was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893 the last founding impulse for the district association for horticulture and horticulture Kulmbach was set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
In 1893, Freilich was raised from baptism.
Also the purpose of the orchard association differed from today's work - it was actually purely a matter of orchards, flowers and horticulture no one thought back then.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his Festvortrag.
Fruit trees should be lined with long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
Today, fruit growing is still the responsibility of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, which comprises almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the mediation of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
As versatile as the tasks of a horticultural association, the members of the Hutschdorfer Jugendgruppe showed "Maulwürfe" on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said the chairman Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences are in nature for life.
The chestnut potato was a big thing for us children, I doubt that smartphone & Co can collect a lot of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner.
"Where the stand shall stand, the district association, the Söllner supplementary county council and emphasised the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county has also left the county business leaders and expert adviser Friedhelm Haun in no doubt.
He led the many visitors with an image presentation through the long history of the circle and, among other things, reported the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was fed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the Nutzgarten turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has endured, it was there before and we have to orient ourselves to it", the expert argued for fruit and nut trees.
That is why we do not give in to the gardening associations the incentive to leave, so that our homeland is beautiful and worth living.
These included welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, as well as the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects that we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the ceremony that was solemnly framed by the towers of the music association Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister leaves UN speech
Mexico ’ s government wants clarity on the nafta: it is issuing an ultimatum to both trading partners for agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and shifts her speech to the United Nations.
The Canadian Secretary of State, Chrystia Freeland, has postponed her speech during the UN General Debate in New York due to the time pressure to reopen the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico.

He was replaced by ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore cannot stand for election.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As the former mayor of São Paulo ’ s millionaire city, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro.

It is not enough for any of the candidates in the first round to obtain an absolute majority; there will be a run-off on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed - no matter who he takes.
Bolsonaro is well known for protecting against homosexuals and blacks and for the military dictatorship (1964-1985).

Another time he said that the followers of Lula's left-wing Workers Party should be shot.

"Here we stand, take the bonsaws and breed a concert tabend with the power of a tiger".
After the sound check and just before the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in cooperation with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - excited the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the Quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with Frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows about the start of the concert also with the latest, unknown pieces from his own feather and the forthcoming CD to convince.
In front of the stage, the band will be danced at the performance for a coherent and.. the, the.,,, the, the,
Although "Zugabe" calls are not to be overheard, left "Tiger Bonesaw" then the trio "Here We Stand" the stage.
Hardrock is not like Hardrock, but shows guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock in the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is also used at "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only does the sweet, down-to-earth "Take Me Home" impress with the change from melodic passages to the gitar-bustling rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The Quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has become famous since its foundation in 2005.
Full agility presents the band on Saturday their hardrock.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its appearances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - has special stage experience is obvious and incomprehensible.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann performs in cooperation with the band in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, completely own accents.
For the more sought-after sound than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann once again delivers his much-acclaimed solo, and he the.
A certain level of volume is part of this hardrock concert at nem: at the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to information from the mixed pult team at the Dreier concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibel.
This is due, for example, to pressure hammer levels, but it is still clearly below the tax deductions of the "Wacken-Fesitvals", which refer to "The Ignition" on its website.
Ohrenbetäubende 120 Dezibel in Düsentrieblautstärke wie beim jährlichen Metal-Stelldichein im Norden der Republik üblich, braucht das Ahlener Publikum bei dieser Rocknacht indessen nicht.
After just four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky Gangart have long convinced themselves with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bones and inflamed a concert table with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say, freed in the transferred sense, at the end.
And especially the great applause of visitors enjoy.

Trump admits to Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that North Korea ’ s US president, despite the nuclear crisis, is well disposed towards Kim.
Now Trump has made his colleague a veritable declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it is a distant relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love on Saturday to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Before supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost incendiary words for the half-too-old proverb of the dynasty of Pyongyang, even though the North Korean nuclear disarmament ring is proving to be quite tough.
"I was tough, he was tough, and between us it went and her," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only did the talks with Kim have melted his heart.
He wrote beautiful letters to me, it was great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim ’ s announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests, though critics have so far paid little more than lip service.
The fact that the affection for the "Rocket Man" – so Trump ’ s nickname for Kim – that his martial threat might not be yours to everyone seemed to be well understood by the US president.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of his performance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling straight away: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That is so unpretentious.
But take care of him, Trump declared, and then put his finger on the crowd: "I have always told you it's so easy to be presidial."
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crazy arena, but only 200 people out there.

Refugees Sancted from Libyan Prison
Nigerian refugees, through a mobile phone video, have pointed to their disastrous prison conditions in Libya, enabling them to be saved.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under threat of life and spread online.
"You refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying.
The recording was sent to the site "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
After all, the refugees were fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we could probably not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video he put himself in danger of death.
One of his comrades was beaten by the guards almost to death, Onyeka said.
Generally, the conditions of detention have been catastrophic: 'They beat us all with pipes and sticks'.
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organising the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back home this year through the program, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of Nigerians now rescued is not exceptional in view of Libya ’ s poor conditions of detention.
From a Hilferuf via mobile video he has not heard so far.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is dominated to a large extent by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.

Towards 16: 50 the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.

Let the Rule of Law in Turkey Go
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has called for his own rule of law in Turkey.
The two countries' relations are currently 'overshadowed', said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This mainly concerns arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that, if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important precondition.
Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans in jail in Turkey, according to his own data.
He formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then re-emphasized the independence of Turkey ’ s judiciary.
Laschet and Erdogan discussed this at short notice in a building belonging to the Bundesverteidigungsministeriums at Cologne Airport.
Initially, it had to take place at Wahn Castle - the castle owners had rejected Erdogan out of political conviction.
Erdogan went on to talk about opening the Ditib-Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: 'Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country'.
And we are also their points of contact - not the Turkish President.
Failure to trust the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump will not tire of emphasizing the success of negotiations on denuclearization in North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for the removal of Washington.
North Korea ’ s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the US government of obstructing negotiations on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula in the UN General Debate.
"The recent deadlock is therefore that the US is building on coercive measures that are lethal for confidence building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we can disarm ourselves as the first self-disarming," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
The fact that punitive measures could force North Korea to its knees is a pipe dream for people who do not know us.
To build trust, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests, destroying a nuclear test facility, Ri pointed out.
On the US side, however, there have been no 'appropriate reactions', the Minister criticised.
Because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile programs, last year alone, the UN Security Council decided three times to impose sanctions on the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, have been pushing for strict enforcement of criminal sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working towards rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea ’ s leader, Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is expected to return to talks about ending North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons program after Pyongyang.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the Municipality of HoT.
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting did not detract from the many visitors of the open door of HoT: white blankets and floral muck on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the Erntedank wor.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
It was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank the food.
The launch with the new facility was not exactly simple, as Henriette Westbuer, the leader of the HoT, remembers.
We had prepared our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were well prepared for the great day.
But then came the bad surprise on the first day after the summer break: a blackout had set aside the huge two-part refrigerator, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from scratch: although we received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, the children and young people wanted to create it alone," he says.
And so they all wrapped up.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Better can't cook it", commended a visitor impressed, while hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests served at quiche, liver cheese or cakes durften.
"It is really great what the children and adolescents have put on their legs", stressed Pfarrer Frank Beckmann, while magicians Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other pieces of art provided for amazement.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW stand of the Tafel.
From frustration with criticism from his own ranks, the chief of the Essen Tafel, Jörg Sartor, handed over his post to the Landesverband.
Sartor had become famous throughout Germany because the Essener Tafel had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice president of the NRW Tafeln, said Sartor the "world on Sunday".
I liked too many in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverbandes NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed an understanding of the decision of his long-time deputy.
The harsh criticism has taken Sartor along.
"I can understand his move - people have said that they did not know exactly why the Essen table is doing that."
However, Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week since nothing changes", says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized in the "World on Sunday" again criticism of colleagues from other tablets.
We must not take the approach of 'starving people in the city without us'.
It is up to the state to ensure that people do not starve.
At a congress of tablets on Friday in Berlin, the Essen did not participate.
"I am told too much sweet jewelry," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies, which I criticised at the time.

"If we marry, then right", he has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the spokesman for the SPD Bundestag and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreises, the conservative SPD wing.
In the federal debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs was horrified by a fury on June 30, 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.

Pleite bei Hertha: Von der Realität eingeholt: Bayern gegen Ajax gefordert gefordert.
In the meantime, the predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not want the FC Bayern to fall.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim decision for Niko Kovac ’ s term of office.
The first small performance models under the new Coach Niko Kovac should not be increased for the Münchner to a larger autumn depth.
"A week ago we still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a bit has caught up with the reality, "noted Thomas Müller after the deserved 0: 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions-League-Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us will know that this annoys us and that we are therefore giving direction to gas on Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal of their own has been shifted, as at the same time the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory, the table running in the football league first lost to Borussia Dortmund.
While the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at the 1: 1 with its intensive manner-opposite mann-tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle-stick over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, just like the most recent overpowering Bavaria.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to make it successful again", Kovac stressed.
In the end, however, he sang surprisingly with his losers in his birthplace and defeated his first defeat as Munich coach only for the once again unsatisfactory handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would, however, be positive before the country break, the first incident of his term of office - otherwise, the tone is likely to get worse.
So Kovac made his second premier class appearance this season after the 2: 0 in Benfica Lisbon no exceptional measures.
After the free day on Sunday begins as planned the short preparation for the second rundenspiel against Ajax, which had also frightened to the prelude AEK Athens with 3: 0.
"Now we caught up in two games, but we will also make our gates again," said Manuel Neuer, a national team captain.
As in the case of the lost Pokalfinale against Eintracht Frankfurt, Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly.
The defender of the law acted as a reminder.
"I do not believe that all this is bad, we also have to work out it again, because we do not make the multitude of opportunities and backwards make the mistakes," said the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bavaria even had five meters behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with one point.
And so, with a wink at least, Kimmich appreciated that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It is good for the league.
DFB boss Schuss: Özil-Causa: Sharf attack of Erdogan on Grindel del
With severe accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
While DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, he never defends the Verbandslinie.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation time in the Permanent Issue Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President criticized Germany for opening the large Ditib-Mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association slinie.
On the early Sunday morning, the Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced in the Mainzer ZDF- "Sportstudio" consequences from Cau.
"We need to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with immigrant backgrounds in the U-teams - that such a thing does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration ombudsman.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan is not in favour of the values of football and the DFB.
He had denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in harsh terms.
Our German born and adult Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they have taken pictures with me in England, "said Erdogan on Saturday in the city.
To be honest, as its president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have ascended into the German national team, have been marginalised.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil after the World Cup affair, which had begun by taking photos of the two with Erdogan, "sensibly treated by the DFB" felt.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German if I lose, I am migrant - that is not possible.
"That he has such an impression, I very much regret," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more and more, as I have always said......,,,,,,,,
But he does not see any basis for a return to the national team.
As a consequence, next to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration commissioner is to be appointed.
"If there is one thing that clearly affects society and football without an immigrant background and says:" The issue is important because we have to take care of ourselves ", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work," Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özi affair, he wants to run for office again next year as DFB president.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes," said Grindel.
Three accidents within three hours are caused by age three.

In the federal debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs was horrified by a fury on June 30, 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Before that, they had been able to register their partnership for life since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the area of adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called the North Macedonia in future.
This is because of its northern province of the same name, which is neighbouring Greece.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens has been blocking any rapprochement of Skopje with the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote 'yes', they will also be giving the starting signal for their country's Western integration.

Switzerland launches an electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden of relatives in stress situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be taken with the explicit consent of Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden of relatives in stress situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs can continue to be extracted with the express consent of Swisstransplant, as is in Germany.
One assumes that 15 percent of Swiss donors have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the talks, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You then have to decide vice-versa in the sense of the deceased, which is often very stressful", says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations for storing data on the possible donation of organs on the health insurance card, as the spokesman for the Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered to be organ donors unless they contradict, or if they are members.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is World Champion in Headcount
The 14 year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in the headcount.
He won the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
The divided Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday with.
The 16 year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany finished third.
The youngest World Cup participant was a 12 year old Japanese student, the oldest one a 74 year old retired from France, as main referee Ralf Laue said.
Informatics professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon in which participants advised against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the contest.
Grüß was in Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old.
With terms like Superhirn, Genie or Wunderkind, organizer Laue can start little.
"Headcount can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadiums of computing contests.
Among the disciplines, for example, the square root is made up of six-figure figures.
When applying for membership, the candidates will receive surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here too, the Germans would have good chances, said the main referee.
Apart from that, Asians are often in advantage, because early childhood headaches tend to be more intense and learn other effective methods.
An urgent appeal: video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer screening
Tennis Ass Serena Williams shows herself from her delicate and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to draw attention to breast cancer with this video and to campaign for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and education.
Serena Williams sings "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" without the song "I Touch Myself" - only their hands hide their most intimate places.

The Government ’ s Prohibition of More extremist Symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish Blue Coalition will send a draft law on the so-called 'Symbole Law' in review.
This is intended to extend significantly the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings snow on the mountains in the west of Neuschn.............
Mrs. Holle is shooting her beds for the first time next week in the west: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall threshold drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys, it drops down to about 1,000 meters in intense intensity.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern you can expect snow from 2,000 metres with 20 to 40 centimetres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore wintry.
Farmers may begin on Monday with the annual Knickpflege
Schleswig-Holstein ’ s farmers are allowed to start the annual Knickpflege on Monday.
The unique "green forests" in Germany have characterised the landscape of the forest region of the Federal State for about 200 years.
The five metre wide tree and rock hedges are "forest treasure" and for many animals and plants the last retreats.
Knicks connect living spaces located as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the Managing Director of the Nature Conservation Association Germany (NABU) said in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are Living Fences
The Knicks were founded on the grounds of a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limbs and cattle fences, they also supplied firewood and beams to the farmers for their workshops.
From that time on, his name "Knick" also came: "By patching" the branches, the dense, interminable boundaries could develop.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, there are some 45 000 kilometres of hedges and give the picture a more elaborately structured landscape.
According to the NABU, it is now used as a replacement space by around 7000 species.
In one kilometer Knick could live up to 1800 different species and up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only be performed by the Knick if it is properly maintained in winter.
Apart from the variety of species, Sonst also shrinks into a light-coloured tree line, which also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Knickpflege can only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian speaks about SItuation on site.
The locals Radia Pinto describes in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and the tsunami:
Have you been there during the tsunami?
No, I was at the time just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
As I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be used.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which are completely destroyed.
Also our office of "World Vision" is destroyed, but we have furnished provisionally something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where do the Sulawesi people now look?
Many are on the surrounding hills, where they still endure fear of another tsunami and earthquakes, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some people are staying in their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and even the petrol stations are completely closed, people sometimes smuggle food and petrol.
The public service has been shut down completely, and the national government is helping.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partially free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information on the island work?
At the moment we have a hand vaccine, but it didn't work before and we got information only on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people they do not know whether they live and where they are staying, because people during the earthquakes were not at home, but for example on the way.
The Tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many people thought 'Okay, not a tsunami' - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was a misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they are banished to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which lies on the Pacific Firering, not prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but that was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a great many people.

A muscle flush usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber usually heals a little faster.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Investigation in the Turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With a FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a thin majority for the contested Judge candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, because of anti-employment charges.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Friday for investigators to investigate the alleged incidents that have lasted more than 30 years.
The most recent turn in the drama surrounding Kavanaughs, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer is angry Tiraden against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judicial Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the conservative judge in the Supreme US Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed safe when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake announced, contrary to his initial announcement, that he would agree, but called for a FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who called Thursday ’ s heavy lectures “Beschiss, ” initially abstained from further attacks on women, and, on the contrary, spoke of“ happiness in disaster. ”
In this way, the last doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, in an election rally, Trump rallied the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump Maps FBI Investigation in the Kavanaugh Fall
The White House has also very limited the powers of the investigators.
One will investigate the known allegations of two women, no longer, said a government representative to the "Wall Street Journal": "They do not go on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile, installed in a "civil vehicle" radar unit of the Municipality of Ried for the surveillance of the temple is stationed on the garden-road, according to the Municipality, from Monday, 1 October.

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: The fear was felt.
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated against Mainz the first season victory.
The relief on bowl is great after the first season victory.
However, Mainz also played a role in the time factor.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball inside.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penal area, "said the athlete of Schalke 04 - and breathe.
After all, the Kings blue still managed to bring the scarce 1: 0 against the Rhine-Hesse over the time and thus the first season victory under the roof and specialist..
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of chief trainer Domenico Tedesco security had given Tedesco: "In sum was the first half time good, both playful and of Pressing".
In fact, not a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that".
The boys were afraid to leave their hands and had therefore withdrawn.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no minor part in it with his head-ballet: "I am actually the worst headballer player in the man's team.
But in the end, only victory matters.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start at the initial stage and make a firework out of it," said Schalke's boss coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, quietly and bravely, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes.
The biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Royal blue missed to worry more for clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met Latte 59. / 72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have become a Zittersieg", Tedesco said: "You have felt the fear a bit."
I am therefore pleased that we have won.
He was not the only songwriter.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
Before them is the author, Professor Doktor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly been invited by Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to get interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates in the orientation of the evening with the alliance "Cultural Policy".
El-Mafaalani rises very loosely in the reading, describing the writing process of the book, talking about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gesture, hard figures and some joke, he brings the listeners one of the most conflict-rich themes closer: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasingly arising despite successful integration?
The most syrical author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table, German society sits at the cats ’ table, the first generation migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflict.
Therefore, it is not crucial whether one fits in politically to the right or to the left, but rather: 'Am I for or against an open society?', he stresses.
Initially rather behaving, then he always runs the discussion round.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell us how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in pupils.
El-Mafaalani is not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is on eye level.
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because 'only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions', says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session, he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, discussed intensively.

Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots of land
The need is obviously huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The town of Pliening has sold the first plots in the Neubaugebiet Landsham-Süd on the free market.
The mayor Roland Frick shares this with.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots is completed, which offers the municipality more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the former home model.
Well 100 applications were received, so Frick.
"Currently the documents are checked", in terms of application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieninger, it is the aim to have drawn up rankings for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council.
Subsequently, the award could take place.
In total, 50 plots of land are being created in the area in the south of Landsham for single and double houses, as well as four plots for multi-family homes with presumably eight housing units.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and roads are to be asphalted soon.
A single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots of land in the socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses in the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 apartments supported by the Free State.
Place for 200 People
Grob is estimated to be created on the area of the new land sham south housing for about 200 people.
Not only that: now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start for the new building of a kindergarten will take place.
Three kindergarten and three crib groups and a multi-purpose room are to be accommodated.

So Schalkes Naldo "big sport" also succeeds on the bank bank.
For the third time in succession not in the Startelf: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had left for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange-bank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the almost two meters big Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered after the 1: 0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle and coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who called all the simplest half Naldo, and said; "We have to thank trainers!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain who, despite his renewed reserve existence, had no resentment.
Naldo probably knows that he was hailed as the best Schalker in the last season, that he was not really on the sidelines with his coach - he was given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It was not easy to tell him that.
"It was not easy to tell him that I tell you quite honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he said Naldo that he was not in the start eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club, "Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone is able to snap through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, Tedesco explained the rotation that last also Naldo caught.
And the Brazilian, with the wisdom of his advanced age, reacted to the Bank as a model team player.
The mood in Austria ’ s industry accelerated its decline relative to the eurozone in August.
The shopping managerindex (PMI) was low at 37-month with 46.7 points.
However, across Europe, Austria has the best third mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, according to the Markit Institute on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI in the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is still the 13th consecutive month under the brand of 50 meters, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France, and Spain, the scoreboard fell, but more slowly than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened decline may mean that the worst is over," said Markit-economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone have fallen as much as they have since November 2011.
For this reason, the companies closed the seventh month in a row.............
In China, too, industrial production fell more strongly than was initially expected in August.
The voting barometer sank from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing management index supports its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
It will raise, among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices.

Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship further from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice, the title defender won two Superstar Neymar matches with 3: 0 (1: 0) and was also successful in the eighth league game.

The Brazilian Neymar brought PSG to the final stand after 22 minutes of leadership and was in the aftermath.
For the interim 2: 0 Christopher Nkunku (46).
This was the second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
On the opening of the premier class, Tuchel ’ s team had 2: 3 in Liverpool, and so far the only required game defeat in this season.
