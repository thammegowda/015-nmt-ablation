Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city.
An astounding institution where young people are to meet today.
A pit chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers.
The oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories.
It annoys if maps are not current.
Everybody knows that, because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the Geoportals of Bavaria of the state government, are far from current - but it is precisely for this reason that they are very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the nineteenth century in the field of distribution of the Munich Merkur.,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that you cannot recognize as such.
In the large overview map, detailed maps of cities and municipalities, so-called Urpositionsblätter, have been included.
These were created according to the Bayerischer Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and originated the first survey of Bayerns.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria for military purposes.
Even though French troops eventually withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the Topographische Bureau and thus the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung.
The Munich Urpositionsblatt dates back to 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek website.
The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
One example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was included 21 years after drawing up the map, in other words in 1877, as Munich's district.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, nothing can be seen as fields - at first glance: a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered pieces of corridors from the so-called "Uraufnahme", from which the base tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer show farmers there - but small gardeners of the land in sun.
A large green area is situated north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 site of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert..
On the other hand, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the hill "on the lies" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with flags.
In 1858 / 59 the Munich-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was born.
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - that psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the anchoring of so-called errors.
He has also prohibited the staff from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients there was first place, later 500 seats were extended.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular irrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar Amper Clinic in Munich Ost, one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrists.
On the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people in Munich now meet in Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training establishments.
Westlich lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the Children ’ s House “Casa Don Bosco ” was built in architectural style on the grounds of the deception that had been destroyed by bombing during World War II.
The Marienplatz was named "Haupt Platz" at 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes into the city centre.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval mine chapel were once standing at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich took place for the second S-Bahn (city rail) trail.
With the slider, the old coin card can be compared to the aerial image of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled.
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to colored people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention to travel through the state and to exercise extreme caution, since a number of dubious, race-based incidents have recently been occurring throughout the state and are recorded here," says the Group's opinion.
A recent law passed by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination actions, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that are disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warning, said NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their colour, they are beaten up or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during his journey by the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of crime.
The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Missouri, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75% more likely than white people.
"The recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared to bring bail money or let relatives know that they travel through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI Hassverbrechens-Berichtsprogramm, which classifies the state as regards the number of such violations on the country ’ s 16th rank.
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigrant attacks, which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezau project is a success project and will continue next year.
The Christian Democrats Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have given an image on the ground.
At the Rechtgrabenhof der Familie Schwendemann, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members.
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, fed 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.
The holiday guests' table is exclusively regional.
Since he is also chairman of the BLHV association of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaunprojekt a "elementary important".
I cannot operate profitably on such steep surfaces.
The green area for a lot of work, much needs to be done with the engine sense.
"We are struggling with the conditions and topography here", said Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he does not run a biofarm.
For mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The local authorities recognized the importance of the Weidezaunprojekt and is pleased with the Leader-Förderung".
Farmers should be supported at the cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare.
I hope that this will allow the reforestation of land to be extended for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they continue to operate," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized for promoting.
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced up over wheat extraction.
The open area is 40 hectares which must not be explored by at least 2023.
Of the total costs of EUR 71 500, half was promoted via Leader, a quarter was carried by the Fischerbach municipality.
Thus, the farmers left EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of wheat.
"The big advantage is the longevity of fences," said Swendemann.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: "You do a good job, without farmers and rural women do not '.
Also for Peter Weiß stood firm: "Here the best food is produced".
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of willow fences.
The objective is to open the Black Forest.
The precondition is the presence of a conveyor programme designated by the LPR.
Moreover, the area to be fenced must not be manageable (over 35%) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application is currently running by eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build nearly 16.
The open area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now Trump ’ s White House is taking the Statue of Freedom
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans, like any other, appreciate Saddam Hussein ’ s carefully staged overthrow in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta about the president ’ s proposals to curtail legal immigration with a statue of liberty.
To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have sounded him if he had done so.
But he attacked their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to her when Emma Lazarus ’ famous poem was added in 1903, 17 years after the monument ’ s completion.
As Miller Acosta appealed: "I do not want to dwell on a complete thing about history here, but the statue of freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightened the world.
The poem you refer to was later added and not part of the original statue of liberty. '
Miller is right, but as he himself put it, it is not really about history.
It is a question of contemporary resonance at the lofty words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: 'Your mosquitos, your poor, / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the elder waste of your rich coasts'.
There was never a time when the 'elusive waste' was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US.
This conflict because of the importance of statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: indeed, it is a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and their friends who campaigned to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a used classical visual representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great horror of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for Trump ’ s coming, argued in 2010 that the statue of freedom does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neo-conservative, bringing the American flame into the world that has been transformed: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not be paving the way for the United States. '
Limbaugh is hardly unusual here.
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, elder but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships.
It is really a question of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and will they have to hear.
And that is not, of course, the prospect that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch is not intended to illuminate the path, but to elicit the hatred that is its only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK Team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team.
The UK athletic performance director Neil Black says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championships will make a massive contribution to the team.
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that 'something special develops in Scotland' and the UK's athletics must learn from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it," said Black.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. '
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great. '
The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete for the 400m hurdle in their fifth World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland ’ s best overall number of athletes at the World Cup was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The medium haul Muir is on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m tubes.
Chris O'Hare, who is running 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scots in Team Lee McConnell was.
The team paper says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but also in some cases in medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team paper is that it was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me, makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podium.
What concerns my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think it went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there. '
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not advertise you for a public office if you cannot stand up for voters ’ fueling.
The father of our country knew a little about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He stepped in criticism, safe.
But he has not silenced his critics.
In 1783, Washington said: 'Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we shall be led like sheep to slaughter'.
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogan ’ s employees blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him early this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?".
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it is important.
And it is particularly important if it is a type like hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters and debut his haarless head to Chemotherapy on his side.
That is why blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is called official and paid for by public taxpayers - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor, arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hasten people who swim online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news "The Post".
"I do not appreciate this idea either if a number of people take a position on the same subject, some people will disregard it as a so-called collective effort rather than a large group of citizens affected '.
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "intercession".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if we had done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that is precisely what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for accusing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she hired a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable porto had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter recorders swallowed his leadership.
Even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions, criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty, trade, and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse form the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Ireland, which last year led alongside the Archerfield links to the final round before losing against Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how it reached its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He is a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window of opportunity for this course. '
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels particularly", said the player heated in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate. '
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to the action on the home floor.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf.
I am glad to see how it has gone. '
With the trio in the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free, the car park costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Less lung cancer deaths by passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) will be present in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year," said study manager Heiko Becher.
In comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases in Germany due to passive smoking per year.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Domestic connections are proving to be very.
The construction works in Villinger Straße are in full swing and "lie reasonably in time", says the head of the Bauhofs Fred Heinze.
In the area of domestic connections, the situation is more complicated than assumed, because there is much hidden underground, which is not included in the plans.
The traffic that keeps obstructing the construction work is a major problem for the Stumpp construction company.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and locks is already enormous", says Heinze.
The road is closed and only buses are entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite strenuous.
Fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a herd.
It rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually describes a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the curved bone is removed and swallowed with icy, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the Lehmboden - she does not have furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as wash clothes with bad water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a dazzless space serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around in the village after 5 p.m.", she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was incorporated in Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public handing over to the occupying forces.
An existing movement that incited independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region, excluding foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island.
The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour car ride with the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city, with some 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated roofs converted into different yellow brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived Mee Pago Papuans a God called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We were not accustomed to wearing these clothes", says Degei and points to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"In the past we had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia ’ s Goldland.
The world ’ s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport dropped $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
Moreover, Papua has estimated $78 billion in timber resources.
However, this wealth is a source of misery for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 to a single officer.
Papua demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gangs and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua ’ s tribal boss in the 1970 ’ s were committed to genocide in accordance with the Asia-Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" is stated in a 2016 Erzdiözese Brisbane report containing reports of atrocities in the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes, following another report, are particularly popular - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased because Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing, as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung-Kantinen sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with Erdnusssauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who went to work in the provincial capital Jayapura.
"It has cost the indigenous Papua - the Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But there has been little change in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts have been broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through darkness on a motorcycle.
The shocked children told them that they should turn their spotlights on.
One of the soldiers took incitement to her tone and returned later with four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk, hunt and beat the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child aged 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so hard hit that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commando center to demand justice.
They carried out ceremonial hunting arches and led the Waita dance - in the circle and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldier was sent a command over an internal spark: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," said TIME in an official document that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto-quarter of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for calm and called on the crowd to return home.
Nobody was in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left hand wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired", he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was" said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only bears a name that TIME is bleak.
"I saw that he was dead... I bought him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It is about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only on the following day.
Three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism for settling historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and in the early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to go through, 'he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, 'everything is regulated by law', he said.
Wiranto, who accused the UN for 'crimes against humanity', which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Paniai victims ’ families received such claims with grim disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
'I am tired. '
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I am afraid," he says.
"I am afraid to be arrested by the military, I am afraid to be shot."..,,,,,,,,,,,,
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military looked after me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to hospital, a person and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man who was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned when he fished in a nearby river died on his way to hospital.
Regulated villagers protested before the company ’ s location office.
The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings.
But locals say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting and killed a crowd.
"We were so panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was witness to how the injured were quickly delivered here, so the TIME.
'I have hid myself two days in my house '.
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to account and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been an unrest for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of tribal Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal living in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by spurring sporadic attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained under the pretext of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some never appear again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as beyond reach.
People here build everything they eat: above all, nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each work on four or five pastries of the sweet potatoes.
They retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten items of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived to Nabire airport since the opening of new routes.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills needed to make their own businesses competitive.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money", says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on media coverage remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia-Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi ’ s election campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the 'various and widespread violations' in Papua, including the Paniai Foundry.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
The Speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the Group's allegations and said journalists in Jakarta: 'There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and there is free media, so it is difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights cases'.
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local silence and afflicted him "We want freedom", according to a source who also participated in the session, but would like to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai committees," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai sailors, like other Papua, consider their voice to Jokowi as a "guilt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the Paniai victims' families carried out a last symbolic act of consolation: the body of a victim was buried in an area close to the police and the military station.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a blessed head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time.
A fire took place on Friday in one of the world ’ s highest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years, which, incidentally, calls the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we stood up for the fire alarm and the horrors of the people.
We ran down the staircase and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor ", a inhabitant told his name as George angab, Reuters.
Dubais civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units at 4.00 p.m. local time (00.00 GMT) sparked fire and cooled the building.
The government said it is working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the clothing, exterior clothing to decoration or insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that they believe that the system of plates to isolate and cover at the London Grenfeld tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his great Davis Cup Coup at the General Assembly.
At the Ho-Chi-Minh City session, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup-Individual was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
Although it is often very long, it is precisely for this reason that the fifth class classics, which are very esteemed, remain in the traditional competition.
63.54% of Member States voted in favour of reform, the ITF President David Haggerty ’ s aim was therefore scarcely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member states did not adopt the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup.
We need a change to safeguard the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions, "said Haggerty.
We will continue to work to improve the evaluation.
It was not until the vote, after many objections, that the proposal had already been made to put the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively small details: the finalists in the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup will have the right to host the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, the requirements for training places etc. will be facilitated and the players will have to make less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring prohibited items into the aircraft, a survey is published.
A survey conducted by air passengers revealed that more than 20% deliberately or unconsciously banned items were smuggled by the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points, including at least 6% that affected the aircraft while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1% claimed that they had been late discovered that they were wrong with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something banned by TSA, 19.7% were millennials, compared to less than 15% that were members of generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% said that, knowing that the security checks carried objects with blades, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately taken banned drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it consulted travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods had been caused by airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry smuggling goods - knowingly or ignorantly - through safety, were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often insecure about what liquids they may take with them or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of items captured by TSA are prohibited.
For a while, the people who thought TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order
Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla Model 3.
In doing so, he has so far underlined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphal figures on turnover increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has, for the first time, betrayed another, less glamorous figure in announcing the recent quarterly balance sheet: the number of cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
Musk has often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months, whose delivery is just beginning.
Musk now admits that 63,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn from the total number of 518..
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of a cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds) "Reservation Payment".
Currently 455,000 such non-committal reservations were made, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling up to now around 12 percent of all orders could be made to the problem.
His argument is that the challenge to ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 - all models are to be combined - 500,000, 2020 a million.
Demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at least in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines tested in practice without any major interruption with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are more delays, the non-binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
After all, the company cannot prevent discontented customers from going away in droves.
EPA boss Pruitt is withdrawing because of the Obama Era ’ s reluctance to reduce emissions.
A day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era ’ s rules to reduce emissions of smog pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of public environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is a deadline that ran for states on 1 October to meet the standards of 2015 for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the fossil-fuel industry.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt ’ s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his U-turn in ozone standards would simply reinforce the EPA ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be prosecuted by groups of activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," Pruitt said that the EPO has sued more than a dozen times in its previous job.
"We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority we have. '
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use its' authority to delay and all other legally available powers' to ensure that the rules' are based on sound policy and the best available information '.
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader revision of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued EPA this week, said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPO - after our complaints - is an important benefit for health and safety from these 6.7 million New York people and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power stations, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources respond to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in vulnerable groups of people, and every year it can contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered about Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crusade of the Trump administration to engage in polluters and their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a Serenade on Sunday 16 July.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the Sixth Benefit Tour can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters Tumlingens their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique dörfliches Kleinod".
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergisches Urkundenbuch: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the remaining parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
The text of the document was written on the Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, also a ruling court, which belonged to the church or the patron saint, not the other way round.
So people lived there.
As emerges from the description of the town of Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, the "mountain" of the third, the ruling settlement of the village of Oberdorf, which is now visible in the of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old maps dating back to the year 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The patronage law originated from the early medieval own church law.
A Lord who built a church, equipped and occupied with a parish, remained the owner of this church and could inherit this church.
The right to use a parish or to propose a new parish to the bishop.
Three altars were in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two were destroyed at Christmas 1673.
The new bell was the first in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were encircled and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was undiced..,,,,,,,,,,,
In 1796 French troops moved near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
In 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilary Church was broken down.
Only the church tower was built.
In the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm broke the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was broken off.
Only the current tower dwarf remained a witness of the 750 years old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem nurture the Hilarius plant as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.
As organiser, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens are invited to the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade.
This is made by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The last word, Hartmut Romann, is speaking.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
The entrance is at 3.30 p.m.
For the end of the Serenade there is a reconstruction in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers reveal the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organisers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens are particularly committed to the care of their home, as confirmed by Serenade-Organisator Walter Martini.
Association wants to check the approval of windmills
"Boisheim defends itself" does not see any legal precondition for construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It has been illegal.
The association argues that, at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, wind turbines could not have been approved at all, as at the time of four, only a wind turbine zone existed at the city border at Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.
Such zones are designed to prevent the landscape from being "sealed".
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by amending the land use plan, but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the certificate of approval is still illegal and therefore to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim defends himself".
The current state of affairs: before the summer recess, the City Council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; permission from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "In this way, permission for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received at the Viersen circle since last week", a speaker explained.
The circle is taking it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are unlikely to stop the procedure.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the Boisheim Association.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build a 4-200 metre-high windmills on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
As early as last year, the company in which the city is indirectly involved had contracts with the owner of the approx. 65 hectares of land.
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to cover the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest some EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich Windpark near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg district in Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crashes together: women die in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were easily injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
After police data, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich was able to take her car in the direction of Bogel, accompanied by her 53-year-old mother. the L 333.
City and Merchants plan "Home Shoes" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region should rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to the shopping mall in the city centre.
As the Chairman of the Trade Association, Christian König, announced, the "home shoppers" weekend should sensitize customers to what offers the city provides away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre should invite you to the "midnight shopping".
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the nearer region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, so Christian König.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The business association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive city centre".
These include new offers such as the first "Aktiv-Tag" to be sold on Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include guests and tourists.
However, many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalising the city centre - to landlords, businesses across the city and clubs.
In the spring, King said that he had to overcome the lethargy with a network that had spread.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five cities will participate in the nationwide third "home shoots" day, for the first time in Thuri.
Besides Bad Langensalza these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should 'advertise for the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities', so strike.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her direct environment.
Two deaths and several injuries after explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people have been injured.
Two people have been killed and nine others injured in a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, some of them hard.
According to the fire brigade, an injured person was in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
A man died when a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A missing person was also born later.
The dead were school employees.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the holiday time, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pushed Mexico for leaked transcripts of telephone calls under pressure to pay the border wall.
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump called on him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President appealed to him because he publicly denounced the wall, and reportedly said to him: 'You cannot say that to the press'.
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the US southern border, and vowed to pay Mexico for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that trade would be "ridiculous", "bad" and "stupid" for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia, and that the existence of trade conveyed by the Obama administration would make him look like a "depp" after proposing a ban on the relocation of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr Turnbull, "that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford-Massacre: Activists revive racist Lynchakt as a call for justice.
A 1948-er Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and moved to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strike - took a long train at his cigar and looked at the windscreen.
Drinks swept into fear.
"We want these n ---- r Roger!" the man buried.
"Get him out of the car!"
Shrine torn the silence when a young black man was torn apart by the front-passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, is only a reflection.
But if a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience enjoyed very real sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
Nobody has ever been accused of murdering.
"It is really inconceivable that, in all these years, no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organise posterity.
"It is a jewellery on a story, but it is a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights activists.
For him, posturing serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A courtesy doctor puts a bed sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Moore family on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of the Lynch process.
But none has ever been indicted.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, citizens ’ lawmakers say that the double motivation for Lynch ’ s actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ’ s decision enabled black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
Roughly at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom stacked a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a battle - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had swallowed with Malcoms wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not born of her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when she moved away from the prison and moved to Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob moved the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison, who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses".
Brooks makes it even more concise.
"It was an electoral law massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, you will pass it here. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual follow-up to Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.
Her portrayal is vivid, touching and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in existence in America.
It is hard to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We do not want to talk about the lynch because we are then confronted with the hardness of all of us," she said.
"But I cannot build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done".
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - walked into a room and listened when Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I am not so," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times."
On the other hand, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who shouts and afflicts him, angry that he has swallowed with his wife Dorothy.
"I said n --- he, disappearing from my property!"
Rascona repairs the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?", Rascona asked.
It is alarmed and confused.
Was I too harsh?
"No," Greene said, still kichernd.
"I simply do not believe that white people said 'n --- he'.
"But", one of the other black performers witched.
"You only have to meet the hard 'R.'.
And that is precisely where energy is shifting in space, a sense of comradeship replaces unease.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman with a sorrow is above the bodies of the actors and interprets Billie Holidays' mourning praise 'Strange Fruit'.
Your vote breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tear out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple is from Ithaca, New York, travelled to see the performance, many come just down the street.
They have all experienced Georgian moisture for nearly eight hours when Brooks leads them to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage trip.
Until this point, the murders have remained anecdotal, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels staggering.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the surname.
Children hock on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent body and whisper each other.
"They are not really dead", a little boy murmurmurmurs as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanked the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wipe out their tears.
Bradshaw surrounds Marbaugh, the man who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their poor, the emotional burden of performance finally breaks with him.
"It is okay", whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did so for one reason. '
Later, the audience is meeting with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta shoots about the reproduction with a black pair that they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling.
"It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does do with me makes me believe that the Lynchen is still going on," she added, "today the only police foundry is called."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Hof keeps at his table, eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he has already begun to plan the performance next year.
"The reflection is somewhat inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It is so if we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again.
Anyone who does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it. '
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colourful staging in front of a gigantic, six-killer backdrop.
The bar (designed by Aleksandar Denic) features a shabby street corner with Mauerrest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer, in which the Rheintöchter poses as a rock energy, or alternatively an Isetta.
Gestapelte Ölfässer recall Castorfs Leitmotiv - Geld, Macht und Gier - das sich durch seine "Ring" -Inszenierung zieht.
The three Rheintöchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drain a body in Hollywood-Manier and give the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the glorious Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he shot Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with a strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and Dirigent Janowski, who humbly burns his hands to the Merkel-Raute.
There is also a big applause for the festival orchestra, which is shown on stage for the first time - in the light of the great heat again in a restful time dressing.
Frank Castorf and his director were eagerly awaited.
Hatte he had to endure a ludicrous Pfeifkonzert in 2013, five years later, there was great jubilation in which the isolated "Buh" cries went down.
Katharina Wagner will have been very pleased about this.
"It is noted that the audience grew together with the" ring "in a way," she said just before the performance of dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also grew an understanding of his view.
I would like to summarise positively.
Max Menge works as volunteers
They work in their volunteer year in several places.
Where everywhere?
Menge: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the Möbelbrücke.
And I have been working on the school in the open day as well.
What are your experiences with this?
quantity: It is a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, a late professional volunteer.
How does that happen?
quantity: I made Abitur.
And then a construction engineer, let us say, successfully aborted.
I realized for me that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, to work with people.
And then I wondered what do you do.
Take a social year, there is a glimpse, as you can see on the spot, perhaps in the focal point, is really.
And was it?
Lots: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.
I will study dual, I am likely to make a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study at Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It is always important to know where to do FSJ.
It is possible to make it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, in other words in afternoon care.
For me this was exactly the right thing to do.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in Bauingenieurstudium?
quantity: Well, this is not about calculating statics.
There are many other people who have a very different history.
Whether a refugee, a young person who has been taken out of the family, must always be dealt with individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of touch?
quantity: I am not the type for that.
It is an area that has a lot to offer.
A lot of love, kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but life is so.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive the business.
The British Pearson education group said on Friday that it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72%, as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces.
The job losses announced by Director-General John Fallon mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 are in addition to its previous restructuring, where 4,000 jobs have already been lost.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another £300 million ($394 million) in a third cost reduction program to revive a business that was hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company that sold its stake in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged, having achieved an increase of 1% to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Konvoi attack by Kabul: Nato-soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killed a Nato soldier and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured, announced a statement by NATO.
Unconfirmed local reports reported that three civilians died in the Qarabagh incident.
The bombing is the last act of violence that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
A statement by NATO states that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an improvised explosive set of people.
The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on Bagram ’ s airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan had at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since US troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump has weighed up the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government in recent weeks, their policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay the Smog Rule
The US Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay Obama ’ s administration ’ s regulation that states are obliged to curb smog-causing emissions a day after 15 states sue the Agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to press ahead with the so-called 'ozone provisions 2015' and said that it indicated the Agency's commitment to work with states.
"We believe in the dialogue and in our response to our state partners," said EPA boss Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June Pruitt announced the EPO's intention to measure the ozone provisions - in which emissions of pollutants are to be measured in part of the country in order to establish where cuts need to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the Colombian district, complained on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental concerns that former President Barack Obama has imposed as part of a broader agenda that Trump is supposed to boost economic growth.
But efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups that worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that air intake containing ozone can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.
Community council wants Community space
In the end, the decision was clear: in the case of two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a Community area in the future senior residence.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the land is signed, the mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
Although it will still take to date the parish area in the municipal council, there is no planning barrier for the project to be stamped by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area.
One of the two investors still on the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area of about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and majority of the municipal council envisage that such a community space should not be seen as a meeting place only for the residents of seniority living, but openly enter the community.
As an example, the word from the "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision made last autumn by allocating funds to the current budget is not taken.
Construction is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a Community area would be, according to Tjaden, eligible for 60% of 30%.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw a stick between the legs in this regard, stipulates that both sattel- - which is based on environmental construction - and powder roof - which reduces the grape height and makes the construction of economic power - would be possible.
Not only does Wilfried Sohmer think this addition is unnecessary.
If it helps, it will happen unanimously.
It is not so easy for the Community area.
Daniela's reputation refers to the many own buildings with which one is not making the most progress, and for that we are now rejecting the Community space from the window, she says: 'I am struggling with it'.
Yvonne Staiger is definitely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against communal participation.
It sees a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give a subsidy, but gives a real value which can be marketed in case of doubt, is the counter-speech.
Staigers ’ request to split the proposal for a decision accordingly finds three supporters.
This is the case with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes in such a way: 'If we take the decision in this way, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure'.
Collision with car: Radler is swept on road.
On Wednesday, an 82-year-old cyclist across the road was captured and badly injured by a car in Garath.

FC Bayern Munich must forego David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund.
The Supercup will take place without him: David Alaba must let the game take place against Dortmund.
The FC Bayern is the first mandatory match for the new season to Dortmund.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
The German soccer recorder Bayern München will continue to increase its staff at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund before the Supercup on Saturday (8.30 p.m. / ZDF and Eurosport).

"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti and added: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
Last but not least, it was good. '
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official season.

I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intensive game ".

Hike to Star Harz
In the Harz, the first "Star Path" is to be created in Germany.
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans to.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "Star Path" meets the information needs of many Harzbesucher.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up along the planned route panels and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase up to 2018, the association plans "well-attainable installations at five to six locations" in the Oberharz.
Infrage would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels should be supplemented via the Internet.
For this reason, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Sternenpfad Zug is to be extended by train.
"On the Star Path, the viewers learn a lot about the physics of the individual stars," said the association.
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why a star is more luminous than another, though it is far further away.
It also mediates the constellation of a selected star and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014, the highest observatory in northern Germany.
The location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen clearly.
Since 2003, the Planetarium Göttingen has been operating on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen, similar to.
Beginning in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetenweg, with its steels, leads to the Hainberg and the Sternwarte - as well as a "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steels with the individual planets - including the degraded pluto to to the end point - are set at exactly the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary route is about four kilometres.
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the world.
The march to the next fixed star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing battle in the near future under £147, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, to Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, the hallway down to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organisation Super-Federweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five Pound-for Pound-list.
Garcia stretched the right hand and said: "How do you, Champion?
I wish you good luck. '
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the pair of photos posited, Lomachenko-Manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size".
"I am a former feather-weight," reminded Garcia.
"I grew up in bronze [to £140], but I'm not so big.
I am small for 140.
I would like to get down to lightweight.
And he must move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That is what the fans are asking for.
Let us give them that '.
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climate asked if it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-Pfund-Debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) of interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight battle in the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in Pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it," said Garcia, and later expressed themselves openly to fight on the network offering the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... '
Garcia said that he regarded Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter" and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko was thinking of the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think the tri-fight champion from Riverside looks "very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey... you want the co-out".
Garcia said the focus is to show strength, then boxes.
Both said that they felt the momentum that built up for their own struggle.
"This is the battle that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on this, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: 'I have waited for the top fighters, and that is Mikey.
It will be a great battle. '
Four injured after Reifenplatzer
In the event of an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
After the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. just before the port of market width probably after a tyre seat.
The car moved to the right to the Böschung, where it flooded and then left on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed to the north for about one hour, and then traffic on the left could be transferred to the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Dreierkette works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes, after 2: 2, to start the season against Braunschweig, that optimizing the defense formation in Aue points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game, and the result would not have been the two counterparts at 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two counterparts too much, and we need to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defender.
In the Erzgebirge, the triangle should be further optimized.
And a gateway after a push, Fortunes no longer want to capture.
"For the future it will be the case that no one is aligning himself with Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope with the three-string experience than with the four-string.
"I do not yet know how we will act in Aue", says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have just in the tripartite on the semipositions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"The condition is that we harmonise even better and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a failed start after a decision, don't know.
The performance could well be okay, "Hoffmann said.
"If, however, we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the Cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start on the season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
His trainer did not want to know about this.
"The start in the season I only judge after six to eight days of the game," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony had to be terminated prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann said that the players from Aue might even be a bit more fresh, because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorites in the bones.
"But they don't know so 100% where they are currently", says Fortuna's interior defender.
It is true that the guests from the Rhineland are going to meet at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue on on Sunday.
"That we sweep them away simply because we have the right to come under the first six is stupid," says Funkel, whose record is positive in defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which you must beat from the outset", explains Fortunas Chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant".
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday., and.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Review
The recent results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new medical assessment method, show that more than 80% of the people tested are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish authority for Forensische Medizin (Rättsmedicinalverket) has begun to carry out the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish migration authority (migration sales) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, migration sales have sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31st July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person 'may be under 18'.
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are quite constant", he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older".
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, the X-ray inspection of Weisheitszähnen and MRT recordings of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later.
"I had reason to think about this, and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used.
Evaluating biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say it safely, we should not pretend that we could do it, "he said the newspaper Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case it is about 10%. '.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Full in Plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.
On Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it runs super", says Reinhold Leicht, Bauleiter at the Department of Road and Transport in the Government Presidium Freiburg.
In April, the work started at the same time on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted arch bridge that is covered with red buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come to the years.
In order to ensure durability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now reached 1.30 metres wide and seven tonnes of the so-called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side.
This is a border fortification, which is also used as an operating route.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 metres wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
This is what the pedestrian path should be.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridges.
Particular sensitivity has required the creation of wires through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fibre optic cable which many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand papers.
In addition, fish and cancers had to be fished first.
For bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the saddle wine in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated in one traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully locked.
The cost of the three bridges together amounts to EUR 700 000.
It is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest in German potato alat
After all, it is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is difficult to reconcile.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) represented in the Volcanic Ivory Circuit are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day, because the AfD invites to the poster "grand campaign launch in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell.
And known names to start - like Alice Weidel, who, together with Alexander Gauland, is the leading duo for the federal election on September 24, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already on the ground hours before the event begins do not want to listen to AfD enthusiasts, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the Stadt-Picknick was planned under the slogan "All at a table" on the Brunnenplatz, but is now on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly before the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that offers.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the authoritative organisers, is right: "Toll, how many people have come together here".
There is music and a lot of food, including a "urdeutscher Kartoffelsalat, which the AfD could eat easily", says the woman who brought him.
The police ordered a lot of officials to Gerolstein, and it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few metres from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported from the AfD volcano board that he tried to do such an event and got the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially been asked in Daun, but got a cancellation there because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes not enough parking space.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
With a view to the event at Rondellvorplatz he says: "This is the good right of people, main thing, it remains peaceful".
This is also happening: around 8 p.m. on Rondellvorplatz a band for entertainment, in the city hall various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
Some 200 listeners in the hall are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence has not changed, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
Some more than an hour the AfD event, the guests on the premises have a longer breath, but there too is scheduled to open shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can move away - no special incidents.
Posaune meets trumpets
The Wolfacher Posaunisten Frederic Belli has been heard again in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.

Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
So Petkov Solotrompeter is the soloposaunist of the SWR Symphonieorchester at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli.
Both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach, for example, won a new Gewand, Daniel Schnyders "World Music" with Bulgarian folklore, and the "Exchange Suite" of the jazz singer Nils Wogram, mix classical, jazz and free games into a fascinating overall art.
This core piece of the program was premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more: the Haslacher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.

I have really violated that.
When I was eleven, the children told me that I would look like a bunch.
I really felt attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think: 'Girls, be proud of you!'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In particular, they don't like to explain their love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and anger me.
And perhaps some call me unwilling, but I do not like to have to justify myself to the public as a whole. '

"Today, I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in Jubel.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans", added Justice.
"As a trainer, I would say that it is time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a carbon business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: 'The change of the party of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working better than to make our country great again.'
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from the top to the bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement the CBS News.
Coe praises' honest 'Russian excuse for doping scandal
The global leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised Thursday, which he described as an obvious excuse from Russia as a doping scandal, but repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be reinstated in sport.
Russia ’ s athletic leader, Dmitry Shylakhtin, said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World athletics championships that the ban on his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said that he was sorry for "all athletes who were torn away in competitions for gold and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for his reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-establish Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the deceased system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players on Friday in London in the light athletics world championships.
The head of the IAAF ask Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned coaches are still active freely, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Trauerakt für in Mali abgestürzte Soldaten Soldaten
At a ceremony in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, approximately 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali have been commemorated.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security precautions.
Defense Minister Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unresolved crash.
She referred to the two pilots who had been killed, but as "experts of her profession".
"We salute the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from North hessen died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their sentences were transferred to Germany and were accompanied on Thursday by a German army guard in the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At midday, only the members of the church took farewell.
After that, the ceremony began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Hessen ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker were among those.
Sadly, roses laid down, the families stood in arms at the coffins.
In front of the church Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Secretary of Defense of the Leyen described the defeated soldiers as "highly decorated" and exchanged.
The Stabshauptmann built the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six Tiger pilots in his region.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the Regiment, among which the soldiers belong, said: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, then it would not have been possible".
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of Leyen: the stakes were dangerous.
But it is also very important for a country from which we are only separated by two states', she said.
After the funeral the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave beside his wife.
The Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royal house was divided on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is placed in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already finished a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen agreed to her husband ’ s decision, it was further stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be set aside in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik never made a statement that he was not happy with his title.
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired, including the title of Prince.
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokesman of the Danish Royal House.
Where the last retirement of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, it is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be settled in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the subject in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, Prince Henrik had a difficult position in his barely 50-year reign at the Danes.
In a autobiography, Henrik spoke about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was pregnant, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I appeared to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was two mistakes! '
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a speedy re-election of land after the loss of the red-green majority, but does not want.
Because, on Friday, Parliament was in favour of the dissolution.
Previously, Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s government plunged into a severe crisis, leaving a Green MEP in Lower Saxony ’ s rural.
Five months before the official date of the country election, the rot-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its narrow one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the election 2018 in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU", she said on Friday in Hanover.
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his group accept them.
This would have CDU and FDP together with 69 seats in the Lower Saxony country day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new country day will be elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the rot-green government of the country must now decide whether it can govern without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, believes it is essential that the day of land should decide on its self-resolution as soon as possible.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is expected to decide on its on Tuesday.
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the country ’ s day will deprive the Prime Minister of confidence and elect a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be checked legally ', said Thümler.
'You will be discussing all the issues calmly when they are legally considered sensibly '.
Thümler called Twestens Schritt "doch etwas kurios".
The politician himself stressed: 'I am not a betrayal.
I feel very good.
She was an advocate of Black Green.
The Greens called for the breakaway MEPs to return their country's mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she has given her country's mandate through the Green National List, with immediate effect," said President Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Group chairman of the Greens / European Free Alliance, Anja Piel, said: 'We deplore the decision of Elke Twesten extraordinarily'.
You have deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group.
'Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in substance, we cannot understand this step '.
SPD chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of Red Green," the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s decision to quickly re-elect the country ’ s day.
Leave Twestens costs the majority of red green in Lower Saxony.
The politician places her wounded vanity and frustration in her personal interests before the welfare of the country, "criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is scandalous that the CDU is involved in this dirty intrigue game in Lower Saxony and is trying to capitalise on it".
Lower Saxony CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his fellow MEPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD group leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 election with personal care.
At that time, the CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the country ’ s day.,,,, and.,,,,,,,,,
Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the German editorial network (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and to check the stamp print.
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the Eier-Chargen affected.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, as we know at the moment, health risks are practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived by the German?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my House has moved on without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the acquaintance of Germany.
All information and risk assessment can be made available to consumers.
Trade, like the manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded by eggs, they are not suitable for transport.
Unburdened eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it is not businesses that are guilty.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
At present, production companies are not directly blamed.
On the contrary, they must expect economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in the worst case.
Is it not a matter of staff or of coherent competence?
It was the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to public prosecutors is of crucial importance in cases where criminal acts can be found.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to be fully informed.
Is it really necessary to have regular alarms on food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and safe food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The money that has been earmarked is putting manufacturers, dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of insecticides in the attitude of life-saving animals is unacceptable and must be brought to an end without.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are quickly and fully clarified.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending on European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s World Record Transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organization that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions-League tournament.
Financial fair play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar ’ s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several $10 million a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money so that Neymar can sign it into a galaxy of other stars, given the team ’ s funding through the energy rich Qatar ruling family.
Clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must counteract legitimate sources of income that allow them to make the break-even point in their soccer business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as president of UEFA in 2007.
Former French players believed that clubs that, in pursuit of success, had taken huge debts effectively deceived and risked ruining if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on club debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested vigorously to improve the team and build a global brand, should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP allocation period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.
And, while Platini fell in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to discouraging excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, opposite The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the proceeds can be expelled at the annual accounts for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, has hit the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by inflating their revenue from companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made to Qatar by the World Cup organisational committee in 2022.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors, and that such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could simply be found out.
Previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to avoiding any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG on Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year still have to be published.
PSG expects Neymars ’ arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising, and jersey sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s withdrawal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily newspaper AS in relation to catars ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports team, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"Once a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay, because different ways can be taken or different interests can be shared when a country has such a big player to represent a country. '
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggilier
In recent years Chocolat Frey Bord Chocolate has produced Swiss chocolate.
Now there is a possible end to the sweet cooperation: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" of Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied", said the speaker.
Approximately 17 million small rotweiss packed shoggitafeln to 14 grams per year distribute the cabin crew to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Nordwestschweiz" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros-Tochter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But, more importantly, the advertising effect is all the more important: it is a prestigious order for a shopper manufacturer.
Like many applicants in the new tender, Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers come into question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey seeks to renew the treaty beyond spring 2018.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate panels have been distributed on board flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility of placing the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be pampered by Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class wet passengers Schoggi of Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also spread over the short distance, both in business and in Economy Class.
Light athletics - Diskus-Olympiasieger Robert Harting reaches WM-Finale
The three-time World Champion is fighting for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, failed in the national championship elimination and was able to look at the discus competition only from the grandstand.
The Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far for the final match, also qualified with the first attempt.
Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche.
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90-year Grunge-era (when the memory of David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch-Komödie "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.
As a cultural artefact it is also a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By moving to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they managed to regain the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting principle, including a reef on the Stalin films of the 1990s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that the cradle").
At one point, a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the courses are the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillon's underlip bar of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old crack.
They are the moments of random madness that this franchise could fuel like a repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even of "GLOW" with its East-West ring-fight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as a director, is to be a captured TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest who are fighting for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism Leninism.
The main roles - a hard saturated Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to the image (the police spend time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer carrying a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single.
With six long episodes, it moves away, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was redirected to a lesser length, could better deliver its agitprop string, as Gregor and Iosef regularly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of Hamburg.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for a celebration.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Beating Drug Mafia in the Land
The police have dealt a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar circle, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, such as the Public Prosecutor's Office of Constance on Friday.
In doing so, 15 accused were arrested between 25 years and 77 years, and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
Moreover, officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects.
The two will probably be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were in.
Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office of Konstanz has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the large-scale deployment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
Ins Visier of the investigations, mainly Italian nationals with close reference to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, should go to the account of the bands.
How many gaps in the Foreign Register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": according to a report, the foreign register in Germany has serious shortcomings.
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's representative for refugee management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the foreign central-register.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to some serious misjudgments in asylum procedures and deportations, "warned in an analysis presented by the" Süddeutsche Zeitung ".
According to the register, ten million people with foreign nationality are covered, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained, data quality has not been good in parts.
In individual cases, data was found in 1921, "of people who have long ceased to live, or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register".
"Bug data input can slow back processes considerably," says the report.
Moreover, the statistics on expatriate people include EU citizens who would not have to leave.
However, such false allocations led to a distorted debate on how to deal with those who are travelling out, so it is said in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government seems to have begun sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 years of age when they have arrived there.
This emerges from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is conducting such procedures for families with children, except for babies and small children, to Italy since 1 June 2017.
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, as the newspaper pointed to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin agreement, refugees from the EU state are responsible for achieving them first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
In order to justify this, the office is now writing: 'Meanwhile, the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased substantially'.
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
The domestic spokesperson in the left-wing faction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children are threatened with human rights abuses in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare".
The second result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Oberreichenbach already provided blood donation service to other people.
At least of the 12 citizens who were awarded Friday.
Jürgen Greule, who, with his now 100 donations, now shared 50 liters of blood.
Traditionally, the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood at the meeting of the municipal council.
"It is genial how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood to strangers, even to this," underscored mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people", explained the circle preparer of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned are broken into their constituents.
Three people could benefit from blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions taken in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRC councillor.
Obviously, the changeover to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were counted among the multiple donors and received 50 blood donations.
Half as many were booked Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spent ten times per 500 milliliters of their life saft.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation slowed speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it included interest rates on family income in the midst of increased pressure.
Monetary Committee ’ s policymakers (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members rising this month, as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% for 2018, warning that fiscal pressure would continue, with inflation expected to rise to close to 3% in the fall.
But they signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to rein in inflation fueled by Brexit, and they said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to allocate cheaper funds to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more within the framework of this system - GBP 115 billion.
minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption."
At interest rates, she repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than the markets expect.
Markets are predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
The Bank ’ s downward revised growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest-rate hike, and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easy to recover after the bank ends of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage increases, because tightening will get worse first before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" income collapse in the coming years, "but it added that wages will recover significantly at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will compensate part of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound ’ s sinking.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for prices and the economy to be fully achieved.
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates, the call for an interest-rate hike increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% last month to 2.6% in June, even though the bank said that this was expected and that it will rebound in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overshoot in relation to its 2% target was' entirely 'to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders are loudly looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who end the existing deals and end the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular. '
NHS (The National Health Service) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people.
Patients will receive HIV prevention treatment as of September after a fight before the High Court against drug financing in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-sex preexposition prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection at high-risk patients by around 86%, is now delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and other clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious agents.
Taking pre-sex PrEP means that just enough drugs are available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a domestic doctor can also register for possible participation in their local sex clinic.
The programme will sign £10 million and NHS England a contract to supply medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as targeted, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in which more than three decades of ongoing progress in tackling one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September to September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. '
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. '
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: 'The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delays in implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV, and that it will help us to move closer to ending the spread of HIV in society '.
The big life: the mezzanine floor and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, fell in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room", says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. '
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely outdated.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauraum and a mezzanine to make the most of the spacious ceiling.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, much light.
That was my request, 'she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, who used 12.5 feet high ceilings to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset.
"The steel mill is quite complicated", he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they had to be stacked together without us having to join.
It was not just a question of building a simple platform, but of creating steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. '
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By perceiving a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Closed kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it", explains Erfan of the steel, furnized MDF door.
"It is counterweight, so if you push the door up, it is very easy to sli..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued", says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the floor".
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
They are important, but they do not play with your heart. '
It shows that a flat can turn into something quite amazing by good design and increased square meters of slightly standard.
Indeed, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave.
Brothers are fighting for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute about one of Victorias ’ largest property imperials worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton football club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburb.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of corporate wealth and Paul about one-third.
A court act states that this means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The departments proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some ownership incompetent.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages of Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held on both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought dairy and delicacy shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood land in which Colin opened the family ’ s first jeans shop.
Colin says that he began Westco there when he was "in my last years the High School when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court", she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Lukas and Mark have become embittered, says Paul "on the terms of their financial separation".
Colin was very restrained, although he was a former member of the AFL board and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by SMS to say 'I really cannot say much' because the case is before the courts.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute," he said and added that he "still hope for a solution".
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts," wrote Colin.
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to curtail the president ’ s media aversion.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even-handed course.
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff, met with senior officials on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information coming into the hands of the president.
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he had received good information. '
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump ’ s relationship with television dates back decades – and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"When candidate Trump was angry for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of posts to convince," said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been under control is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We will probably never hear anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If his staff managed to keep him out of trouble a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to give the President questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuttings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he understands where they come from.
This was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or offered no concrete evidence, or that he had reproached and revoked false allegations in the past.
Trump read the article and began to question Walsh staff. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram Trump receives.
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulse self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult.
Most sought after criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending out (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals this summer.
Since the addresses of the sword-criminals are naturally not known, indications from the population are hoped and requested.
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the 'EU Most Wanted' calendar of winter.
The experience would have shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards have been compiled for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online enquiries have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a grave and return to the 'Millionaire' series.
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travellers at the war foot, who negotiated a tomb drawn by the community to call back a field in front of their manor houses.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull called the "Millionaire series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters, after they were thrown out only in May, but without being deterred by a burial excavated by the Council to prevent their occurrences.
The tactful group found a gap in defence equipment and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Outraging residents have afflicted the advice of Solihull, who said that it was' useless to deal with the problem '.
An anonymous inhabitant said: 'They went there on Monday evening after being sent back by Bentley Heath, where they thrown stones onto the passersby.
The Council must be forced into practice by Scham, because it was useless when dealing with the problem.
Travellers were there in May, moved forward and are now back.
More came yesterday evening, probably even more today. '
She added: 'The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it. '
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said: 'It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travellers to be plundered by another round.
The figures have increased this time and have even seen a horse in the parking area '.
A spokesperson in the Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case. '
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is being renovated and is to be reopened on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
After all, with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH, about 30 000 overnight stays were lost at the time of 13 April 2014 and revenue from the spa tax.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation, given dramatically rising numbers of refugees who came to the county county, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the council.
But, above all, Freudenstadt ’ s mayor, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel ’ s location and talked about serious interests at the time.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels Group, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it into a three-star hotel named Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it is clear what extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were torn out, blankets were partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It is actually a nice hotel", says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should be "beautiful citizen-close" later, as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a jewel on the outside".
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included in the facilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated inner city level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to set up a wide range, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel at ease in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so Scherer., and.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The city's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
After the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define himself exactly.
He expects just under EUR 1 million.
The exterior systems are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible by the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russland-Affaires: US Special Adviser sets a Grand Jury
In US President Donald Trump ’ s case of Russia, special counsel Robert Mueller is to have appointed a Grand Jury after a report.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal", invoking trusted individuals.
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already initial invitations from the board in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there was agreement between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow.
The investigation should focus on several men who acted as a Republican adviser in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also looked at more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Trump ’ s Special Envoy personally focused on investigating whether the president may have hindered justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether to charge charges.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called prosecutors.
In most cases, they are switched on when they are larger and controversial.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to pre-empt people for interrogation.
According to CNN, preliminary invitations have already been issued, turning around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump ’ s Jr., Trump ’ s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his former campaign leader, Paul Manafort, were also involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the establishment shows that Mueller is not intimidating in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge.
Nevertheless, the appointment of the body to begin a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia's history is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives the democrats a chance to 'feel good because they have nothing else to talk about'.
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.
But they usually work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Envoy in a fair manner.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not determined against the president.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed, the explanation went on.
But Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this robbery, accusations against Trump had become louder, he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey told a Senate Committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special broker and his staff.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Councillor, such as in the Watergate affair, Mueller has a position in which, in theory, he could be fired by the Justice Department at the instigation of the president.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special counsel could no longer be made redundant.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of Berlin ’ s barely seven-fold size has been solved by Schelfeis.
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research was announced on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs more than a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres, is now going to north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted.
It is one of the largest ice giants in the last three decades with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres.
It does not pose a threat to people.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear in the light of research.
In total, however, for about 30 years, there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice cuffs in the region, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
Many researchers believe that this could be linked to global warming.
The now broken Koloss has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this slap, the balance of guards and breaks was disturbed a few years ago.
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete slap.
There is some point in favour of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis being put in jeopardy, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can fall apart if a key spot breaks down.
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level because they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it does after melting itself.
However, the loss of the skull leads to the glacier coming directly into the sea and being able to flow much faster than before.
This may increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis, according to AWI data, is the fourth largest skeleton of Antarctica, with almost 50 000.
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge of the free ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
"This is the widest withdrawal since the records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: 'Our models say that it will be less stable'.
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not return to climate change to the demolition of this gigantic iceberg, many iceberg of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.
This long neck of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.
According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperature is the fastest.
CDU wants domestic tariffs for staff
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU is asking the employers' association to resign in order to become more attractive.
Only just before the summer break, the roundabout has woken up 41 new administrative posts.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind.
Teachers at the circle are obviously very desired.
Approximately 620 applications have been recorded for places to be placed this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently there are still 50 vacancies in Mettmann circle.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces are invited.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and confront the shortage of skilled workers in administration.
According to the request of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for the recruitment and personnel development.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals, but to counteract the shortage of candidates for the future.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, identify concrete measures for cross-frontier entrants and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not previously known.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of a real 'competition between public employers'.
In addition, a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age are excluded.
So it is time to act so that there are no more jobs left.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU group, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently offered a faustdick surprise when he publicly questioned the staff cost cap and hiked the other parties.
People want all possible ways to be reviewed to allow a withdrawal from the local employers' association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - should aim for a domestic tariff," says people.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff.
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level that is oriented to professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago new premises had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on prostitutes.
Last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy is tightening the tone of NGO migrant bailouts
Italy has warned NGOs that the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean should not continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turiner Tageszeitung La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet', because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in ways that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to give its opinion on detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, and will continue to be our top priority to save human life, so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
"We can only judge all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can judge the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Youth Save', the Iuventa, since October.
It is presumed that his crew will take on board slurry migrants delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting took place allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Public Prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motive.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to keep to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain., the,, and.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary, but acceptable, because they would not introduce 'substantial changes or obstacles' to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libya ’ s coastguard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
Anstiege and Trials
Neun Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy Trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It was followed by lookout points, partly on towers, of which one could look far beyond the woods and the above plains.
In between, there have always been longer increases, for which long trials have been rewarded.
The second day was followed by Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, lookout point at lookout point, connected by "flowige" trials and moderate increases.
On the last two days, many meters of altitude were again scheduled.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shopping huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathe saline sole in the open-air inhalatory.
Neustadt was also taxed.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sports
Are the sports stars going to fight against computer consoles in the future, instead of being fucked by wind and weather over?
The fact is that e-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high margins including.
This has also recognised the first Bundesliga averages, which are increasingly involved in this area.
At the beginning of 2015, VfL Wolfsburg, later FC Schalke 04 followed, and last but not least the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and incorporated two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB", says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that there are still a number of clubs on this train".
This weekend, the FIFA World Cup Football Federation in London is organising the first Interactive Club World Cup, where the gamers of different clubs compete.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year-olds in particular, that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially Asian ones.
With prominent E-sportsmen under contract, you could be present online much more often in these markets than just sending the Bundesligamannschaft to Asia once a year.
What exactly is this about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or even FIFA football simulation at competitive level are fought out.
As in normal sport, leagues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And with Asienspielen 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is this a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly needed.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions which are also found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid response capability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also train their bodies and take care of nutrition.
"The fitte player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult to implement in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport lacked.
On the positive side, the scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
Players are travelling internationally, as a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.
In 2016, Germany implemented EUR 50 million, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, sales will be 130 million.
It is little against the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the football league.
However, e-sports is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey ", the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are already international.
Big markets are Asia and the US, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood-Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There are also things that are happening in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a subject of teaching, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB's Executive Board Röttgermann.
It is only in nostalgia to fall, and the old times are no longer enough.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to orient the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world", says Dutt.
"It is not possible to say that only football will keep everything as it has always been."
Gift-Eier ade - Ei alternatives to cooking and baking
The scandal of toxic eggs has now affected almost all the federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and have taken all eggs out of sale throughout Germany.
In the shelves, only eggs are to be taken which are demonstrably not containing a fipronil.
Michelle Carter condemns Conrad Roy for suicide for the texts.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: 'My family is unspeakable.
My son was my best friend. '
Carter was allowed to remain vacant until he was appointed.
She was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered a mental illness.
In red trousers and a cream coloured blouse, Carter stood in the eyes with tears, with folded hands and down when convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor in the court.
"She finished his life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility ', she said.
"She has shown no repentance".
But Carter's lawyer said that it is a 'terrible circumstance that she utterly deplores'.
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that their "age or maturity, or even their mental illness, have a significant influence on their actions".
A Public Prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, saying that there is' no day on which I do not entrust the loss of my beloved son.
I would like him to be proud of me and, as I do, I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we will bear for eternity.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "persecuted" by knowing that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children.
"Having no longer this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang on, spring from a building, first you yourself, I do not know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "You must do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from the case by any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murders in Italy in 2007, before being freed two years ago.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: 'Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison'.
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new Mini-Lahm of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern mourns the Confed-Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not harm.
Something was different in his seat in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the additional garment was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer was seen, he made the binde allocated to him stop the arm.
"The trainer did not announce it", the Confed-Cup winner told after his first bet as a Bayern-Kapitän.
Good, the one could have run better than the 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of Coach could also interpret Kimmich.
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as the leader of the C-Elf as the player of youth players, debutants and especially from the holiday.
Sugar is best distributed to those who have a lot of confidence that you want to keep at your mood.
So if you ’ ve been able to explore the legacy of Lahm, a little extra motivation can only be used well.
Kimmich confirmed: "That is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday the 22-year-old was flying over the field as a mini-lahm.
Right at the back, this is now his position, the white link at the arm did its rest.
And even Kimmich worked in this startup formation as the one who can best take the ruder into his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unrecorded force.
He had a look at the whole thing, while many others were concerned with himself.
Vidal thus overplaying his missing fitness (scarcely folded); Renato Sanches so that he could join the achievements of the Asian journey (even limited); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot no negative.
That was all very well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acted sovereign.
The famous Napoli storm was often difficult, and additionally tried to succeed in building the game a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was' not as we hoped '.
But he also showed a decent performance in debut.
Publishing of games, change of tempo: "For this style I was also fetched".
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the newcomers, it was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
After a few tough statements in the back of his new players, Kimmich passed away.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria you simply have to win any game ".
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB-Ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria ’ s most famous soccer player reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wanted the Austrian Austrian ÖFB ladies well.
The Bayern-Legionär is a club collegue of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our ladys.
The Tweet of the Austrian soccer player of the year and Champions-League winner should be a special motivation injection.
The famous Bayern-Dusel may well need our ladies.
Businesses satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economics praises Wissings Tempo
It was often incomprehensible, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is apparent after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and businesses from the region are talking about a change in economic policy on the V question and, at the same time, the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Unternehmen (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which has all blocked Lemke".
The biggest U-turn is NATO ’ s infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021.
A role in the country ’ s plans is also played by the West Indies Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Traffic Trail Plan.
The aim is to launch the route in December 2020, says Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a way of supporting regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier aims to increase sales in supermarkets, as suggested by Wissing, to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been taking place for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company praises the IHK.
The Handwerkskammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new master bus, says CEO Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of EUR 1000 for the best master exam and EUR 2500 if graduates make themselves self-employed within ten years of master training.
But the country ’ s house tax list remains long.
In the planned construction of roads, facts can be quickly established, while the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, the chief executive officer of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers, who want to stop hint at local mobility, only 29 posts have been occupied.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group vize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million less in the preservation of national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, as he wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also sobering that we have had broadband in the country.
In 2016, regional companies only assessed net supply in an IHK survey with the note 3.4.
They complained about stocking Internet connections and breakdowns.
On the other hand, former Minister Eveline Lemke is out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke on April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe - where, after four months of disagreement, she had already cleared the field again.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash.
A day before Audi announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that 'there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions', and related to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems for neutralising exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles are also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which have managed to regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested, but which are reduced in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions legislation in Europe, and a question focused on the United States was extended.
Audi ’ s involvement in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profits.

Mordillos Knollennasen and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoons, the nolles of his characters are his trademarks.
Even with 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: laugh, 'because there is too much suffering in the world'.
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he proposed, among other things, as a draftsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York, and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he says that he is still sitting in the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plush and watches, his drolligen figures continue to be widely spread around the world.
For six years, he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it is strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he is more likely to rely on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
Lavender from Provence is threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to drought conditions and insects transmitted to diseases, causing great headache to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cicadas, and there are many of them in very dry weather. '
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender solder not only attracts tourists, it is also very important for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. '
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of soil evaporation, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary.
This Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Krämer, Zünfte, Händler, Vaganten oder ein Landsknechtslager sollen an diesen Tagen in der Innenstadt erleben sein.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The Riodoce weekly staff usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in Sinaloa state through organized crime, corrupt officials, and interrogatory drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what is more secure: they are supposed to take their children into office, who were the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a cube on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary to reach perceptions and feelings of construction.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and, throughout the country, there are more and more journalists in the process: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 after attacks and threats under federal protection, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs at the facade of the Riodoce building.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special Federal Office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they are still insisting on treating Sinaloa ’ s violence, even though it is unfathomable and even though the terrain is now more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we do not know the Why, we distrust everyone."
In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced from his car, and 12 times was shot on him, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve River".
The shooter went away in his car and damaged it near.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But there is virtually no silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlegrounds, as rival groups are struggling to fill the vacuum.
It makes no sense that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of galvanized, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for one minute that there is a state of 'peace' when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is to blame for not protecting his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman ’ s sons.
This release may have annoyed the sons, Gangmitglieder suspected each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined together five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50 holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish tough investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the Committee's International Press Freedom Award to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to continue living", he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You must take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumes.
I do not want to be asked: 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why did you not say what happened?'
The Riodoce team is missing Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who was able to flood like a port worker, the friend who was generous with embrace and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted on their routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his despair?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it if you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their home runways, to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it is wrong, stay away.
The anger is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space in which Riodoce ’ s employees met for security training, no mobile phones were suddenly allowed.
Two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were instructed by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50% of the policemen who described the governor himself as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has clicked on three main stories.
There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending focused on the hometown of the governor.
And there was a group that carried out abduction in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Public Prosecutor.
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was needed when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows: the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high-calibre cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, Valdez ’ s readers would have regarded the column as the best informed source of abduction.
"In the past we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken."
Valdez ’ s office was transformed into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against journalists ’ murders, because employees have become something they would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez scored a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.
Journalists have become louder throughout the country by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on footpaths and buildings.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
Since then, she has been asked to be redistributed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials involved and a society of equal importance.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by politicians and security forces who stumbled with organized crime.
Last year, the Media Guardian Group "Articulo 19" allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and officials.
"In Mexico you died because they want you to keep the mouth", said Ramirez.
Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border country of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Your body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel: 'Here I am because of my reports'.
A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries, or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015, together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City.
For those who stay behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, suggests that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico goes hell, so I became reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to catch.
A series of shootings with bandages and security forces near the resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartels in the region.
From the border stone edge, they published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phones.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirene hired near - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who watched to see if they were willing.
If they were afraid at all, they did not.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"As you can only remember to close," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the interns asked me to send them to the streets to report."
Dinosaurs used Tarnung to evade its enemies.
At first glance it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so good that they were even able to see that his flesh was of reddish brown - and they said it had something of a 'troubled past'.
The report in the Current Biology magazine called it "the best stocked dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His unbelievably well preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable".
According to National Geographic reports, the cultivated herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
He discovered Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years revealing the wild animal within the £2,500 (1,100 kg) heavy earthing slump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little with your eyes, you might almost believe it has slipped," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to see.
"It will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this herbivore, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, is likely to be threatened by meat eating dinosaurs.
The much-tightened dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterfeiting, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed him to mix better in his surroundings and evade his enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exploring it carefully.
Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, allowed him to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the shade, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the shade is customary, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from meat eaten dinosaurs that evolution encouraged the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use contery shades - think of deer, zebras or belts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily stocked dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk era must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal on evidence of his life, including his conserved intestinal, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was torn into a river and pushed into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is covered fully with canned scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal now looks almost the same as in the early chalk period.
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just shoot a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is in sleep. '
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, went through the earth.
Although the king lived from them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was driven by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology journal, believe that Borealopelta has been contaminated after death in the sea and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.,,,, and.,,,,,,,,,,,
According to the museum, it is the best dressed dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long peaks, which came from its shoulders.
Researchers believe that the stocked herbivores were flooded by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the water burnt of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover holy tank plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is rarely as a win in the Lotto.
The more I see it, the more confused it becomes.
Auction residues of the skin still cover the holy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are stretched up.
I can count the scales on his sole '.
In the thunderstorm: mass carambolage on A8: Many injured.
A heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are many injured, kilometres of traffic jams and suitcases.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), some 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the late afternoon of Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, at 5 p.m. between the stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg), during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably lorries, were transported elsewhere.
In the first place, no information was provided about the exact number of injured persons.
It is about light to medium serious injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of driving in Munich, a 10-kilometre backlog was formed.
As a AZ reporter reported, there were also massive disabilities on the counter-road - through numerous suitcases.
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers, who now face severe penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45, a second accident occurred at the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
This led to a collision between a car transporter and a passenger.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing is waiting for you in the train and sleeping.
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant idea.
And then: pufff.
If the Schaffner comes and awakens an ungentle or rides the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Travel card control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creamless ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket.
Currently, a test operation runs on two routes.
"We extend the offer.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a railway precher.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket devaluation without Schaffner.
However, in order to be able to use them, a number of conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - as most passengers already do.
It is also necessary to have bought the DB Navigator via the train, which is the most convenient way to book a ticket.
Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You climb into the train, your ticket calls under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will appear in the test customers.
The attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passengers X is in the train and took the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant is in place when checking the ticket, he knows that there is a passenger with already depreciated online ticket.
So you can sleep further, continue working, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should be used for passengers.
"If you want to travel with our train crew without ticketing control, check in the DB Navigator is easy to use.
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time in train, "says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr's Marketing Board.
Second plus: "Our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often drive trains know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest troubles.
Because often you do not have all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets, in any case.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to present.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the part or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket, and ultimately takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that is only for ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further numbers on the same route are not yet available.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," said it.
Realize because nobody else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah has been constantly on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed by Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year-old, killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He postulated a picture of browns vivid body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She put her mobile phone to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield-Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who bore a sign saying: 'Ferguson's police has just killed my unarmed son!'
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bell dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman secured his rifle and cried: "I will kill you... animals all."
"This is not customary", Ferrell remembered her statement.
'This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical '.
At this moment I felt ashamed.
I was angry and crying. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After the landing, she picked her 6-year-old daughter from her father ’ s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and who filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell, with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two spoke a conversation they had many times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state «.
"Thou remember how I taught thee when black people have to fight for this, what they believe?" She remembered what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and was not right.
I could not take her along, "said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
They must know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman child.
I have the feeling that I would do her a disservice to keep them away. '
The first station when it arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground when activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. '
weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said they and their cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: 'Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?'
This skepticism has been fuelled by countless cases of people, often white, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: 'We heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not centralise their voices and we wanted to do it differently'.
Folayan had already worked with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death tractors.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, because that is how I will be presented."
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together ", said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked", said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I have understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. '
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women".
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action", where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, even though it was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is at stake so much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can feel your energy through the screen. '
Meanwhile, the Ferguson news cameras have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
However, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains'.
From Dream to Size: TV readers discuss Bit Gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Kalt hardly makes the subject one.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.
While some say to the Bit Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Do not brew a man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "magnitude!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters are counting on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, as the other shops also benefit, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bloom.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the land where the farmer market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work this will stop.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone room: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farmer market hall for many years.
Our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women, are always very happy.
We also discovered the butchers for ourselves.
We would like this offer to be maintained during and above all after the construction of the gallery.
There are also other cities.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether directly marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes up to the level of the rent.
However, this should not be very low in the new project. '
Eva Kilic: "Wozu Einkaufspaläste in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough in our city.
You can see how many shops here are empty - some months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we should at least retain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, retail stores are only rented by larger companies in a shopping centre, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.
It is a pity that there is almost no more specialty shops and what remains of them will probably disappear. '
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all, where is the farmer ’ s market hall to go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the Bit Gallery actually comes.
Or does the Gespenst Bit Gallery already manage to sell all shops from Bitburg? "
George Marquet: "This will simply not work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, thanks to the insane many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg no longer give.
When the farmer market hall is broken down, a piece of culture will disappear again. '
A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which almost unnoticeably same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from chelsea Manning from chelsea tubes and.
Manning sent out sections from Fort Leavenworth prison, where former intelligence analyst had a 35-year prison sentence after making public diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website classified as secret.
The new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united its expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud, and theft.
The prison suppressed her image so much that there was only one photo - a grained, black and white selfie in which man is clearly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette stumbles and chewing gums by extracting DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people might look like.
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse have become unequal friends of letters that have been exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea would transform his judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.
That Obama, indeed, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence only a few days after the book was published, calling for Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetful ways to further inflate the inflexible divisions that he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a particular reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded an end to the "automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth meter of Cs and Gs and As written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist) how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is the 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the aforementioned comic novel.
She shows Manning how she emerges with a free phone in hand from the disciplinary balloon of the United States, such as King's song.
"When they cold your speech, they won," it says.
"So never stop the mouth".
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greeted Philadelphia.
"I still get goose watching when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do so, it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, from their own genomic simulacs that clash like the hordes of protesters.
This was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, such as the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing.
A nationwide human hunt is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who was sought as suspects after a man was raised in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with lethal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued due to their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as demonstrated by the acts of the Cook County Court.
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community alert system published by the Chicago Police Agency states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell Duranleau was declared dead in the place of what happened, and Detective investigated the plight as murder, while the police actively searched for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem has now been assessed and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman of the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that 'we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in every way possible'.
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Agency, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building owner of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WAD roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping) at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap.
The WAD roadmap has been updated in this respect, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code describing the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and recently published on the organization ’ s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation carried out by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: 'We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist. '
Mutko ’ s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian outlet RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody has any idea of accepting this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the WADA scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to Moscow headquarters in July, WADA ’ s Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for now.
They shared the business groups.
It was a mere precaution that no health impact could continue to be expected.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which has demonstrably been tested against fipronial anti-Laedite.
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with its customers.
Start ups that will help your company not become the next Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Gesellschaft Madison Reed.
It has called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is on the increase to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C Suite managers and directly address the board.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glint in the three years.
In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card from the company, which at a glance shows which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can check why.
Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation, and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the Financial Technical Website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, who helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity early this year amid the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behaviour.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion captured the regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the Restaurant-Kette with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company ’ s headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said that there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were in offices in cities or states, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships, can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring charges for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity for Venture Capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising all capital to $47 million.
Glitcers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
There is a growing range of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well, and companies run when employees are committed.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee involvement in the workplace culture experts is important.
But the data is useless if managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or at all, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you do not follow people will ask," Have you really heard me?
Do you care about this?
And whom you do not care about, why should I? '
Madison Reed, who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, so Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly gaining new insights about its employees, and it hopes that in the long term this will lead to a better link between workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It starts at 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the team's new practice fields are on the campus.
Some have pulled out their jerseys and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, this is a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three-hour exercise before returning to the waterman Football Center next morning.
"This is a real Tretmühle for the guys the next three days," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 to meet the already packed schedule of players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved almost a week after the last season, and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood performed practical exercises.
They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during the course of August, 20 before for against Texas A in September.
Mora said that he supports the NCAA regulatory change, even if they add another item to the player ’ s busy routs.
"We put this enormous burden three or four days on them, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they simply pushed it through, they plack on, they are great people.
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great. '
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of sight of its fields, has been guarded by a adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been guarded with footballs that have cleared a safety net behind a gate post, will not be an easy task.
Bruins-Spieler should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people hire a room there and then prepare to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape from an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I am not worried too much about that.
We have a plan. '
Facebook wants to intensify fact-finding in the fight against counterfeit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake verifiers from third parties, and then show their results under the original post, said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday, one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin by using updated machine learning methods to detect possible misdemeanours and send them to factual inspectors who may display results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main defense points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hasty postings as they did before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
"In addition to knowing which stories are challenged by fact-checking third-party parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog.
It added that Facebook continues to test its feature to the "related article" and to work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in an Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says weary.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands."
"A Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney, each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the pressure of thumb on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jakobiner," he says.
"That is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell after smoke, because at that time they ignited fire because of light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there.
Oh, I love Archive! '
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have a welcome greeting a little exaggerated"), this seems all too beautiful to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hymns on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He wandered through the terrain and ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape owners, gardeners and sometimes also to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he trank "Whiskey and started writing".
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when Elizabeth Hussey died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees began to look after the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, wirf it on the attic ".
Tagebücher, letters from the time of English Empires, maps representing who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.
Young, let everything go! '
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 farm rebellion.
"There is a record of a turmoil that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"The farm uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Perhaps the two are linked? '
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "The lords seemed to be quite palate, keep on making debts and spending money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to advertise herbicides. '
After the end of his mission in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences.
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has been called back by nature since then.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like: 'Well, now I have to deal with the damned life again'.
Campaign started: over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf hides.
With the contraception of the 301 year old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Thursday ’ s round show) on Friday.
Until Thursday, mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there should be a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or? ", ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't think that (of course!) really", they write on their website that was released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that we as Bad Honnefer citizens are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city. '
The action is about more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it is.
"It is important to formulate an all-time promise, one that gives the city a distinctive one-stop feature".
After all, they compete with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef has a middle five-digit amount to cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August, Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council (YAS) on retirement and carriage in the Official Corps.
This week too.
At first glance a normal procedure.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the Prime Minister's office.
At the meetings of the Heads of Government, the five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and External Relations took part in the discussions.
In this way, the YAS civilians were in the vast.
The government is attracting the reins in the military.
The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup, Prime Minister Erdogan fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army ranks - mostly because of alleged ties to the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the coup ’ s draftsman.
There have been negotiations in Ankara this week against 486 people who should have been directly involved in the attempted coup.
As early as the day after the coup, Erdogan called the 'worship' attempt, as he gave him the opportunity to 'completely clean up the armed forces'.
But has Erdogan really got the army under control?
At the end of February the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unbehagen im Militär-Hauptquartier".
At the general level, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the prohibition of headscarves for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large-scale cleansing of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered another 7395 officers to fire, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
In doing so, it seemed that Erdoğan tamed the military.
The generals used to be the real masters of the country.
They threw three times, invoking their role as guardians of the secular order.
After winning in 2002, Erdogan pushed the military ’ s power step by step, not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reforms.
Former officers say that Erdogan is pursuing a targeted Islamization of the armed forces.
In the Vocal Europe magazine, a not-so-unknown officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt to prosecute abroad, warned the Turkish army in a few years' full of extremists and salafists'.
If that is true, such a development could not leave Nato cold.
In any case, the alliance has doubts about the Turkish army ’ s willingness to act.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened", say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries receive green cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, ” Trump said.
Ministerium wants to rehabilitate race track for racetrack huts
Over the last few months we have been talking about the future of the racetrack huttles - now we want to go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is planned to be built on the marsh track on which the tourist track is going.
In order to secure the future of the racetrack hut in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work is to begin this year.
"With the decision to continue to order and rehabilitate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, which is particularly important for tourism," said Minister Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was about EUR 2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country takes 75%.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being definitively voted on, declared Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Tyrolean Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"This is the road map, the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This should be the order for the racetrack shuttle on December 2017.
The racetrack shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, especially in.
Over the past few months, a pilot operation has been tested to determine whether the distance is used by enough people to order it again in the future.
The route is also very flat in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried.
Just when you thought that 2017 cannot become even more crazy, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yes, indeed.
Sex-robots are a big thing at the moment.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritated professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield, and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest and the type of fingernails.
"People make fun of them, but the companies provide a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report.
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also customize his robot according to his convictions, choosing everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the chest warts to the type or color of his finger nails.
But it will be even more worrying because many robots have "personalities" who would make a step-woman look progressive.
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shredding.
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of intimacy and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as well as possible", blackens the website of True Companion.
Whatever you like, it may not, whatever you like, etc.
She also has her votes during the day - like real people!
It can be tired, fixed to conversation or it can be "in mood"!
There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape when one takes a step on Frigid (i.e., reluctant) Farrah, worry one most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have a Roxxxxy?" says it on the site.
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain provisionally marginalized in consumption culture.
But what leaks through the periphery can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who has irradiated to have sexually attacked women.
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the winding bodies and the blown eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as possible (albeit with pornography proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, when it comes to their 'personalities', the robots are not real women.
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply go away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation.
In other words, they are fake slaves.
Or, to put it bluntly in 2017: Cities of Service
Trump ’ s great achievement?
Mitt Romney is the epitome of common sense.
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Erntedankfest, there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s rel.
We are all pretending to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less notice has been the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousine, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
It reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.
With Trump in the White House, anyone who knows it, including the Republican kinship with which she fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and curiously on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing to do in the dining table, but it seems to me that this also entails significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the staggering effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about 'normalization' and Trump, we are referring to the gruesome possibility that one day his patrons will no longer kill us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump normalizes right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality compared to their standards.
I find myself today affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - both of which are in fact a very mild crime compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an incalculable improvement.
When my cousine was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Park carousels, and the best three dollars that can be spent in the city if you don't need a cafe.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarce and the animals are twisting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate-perming music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely out of the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a large roundabout in northern London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strange magical experience, as there are two two-year, an 11-year old and two women in the 40-year-old and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffeehouse on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option of compensating for the evaluation with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the charge.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is needed.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologically grinsend, while I tired of the experience of reaching her credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with breast pain from prison moved to hospital.
Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrestling, according to the prison authorities, following a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine ’ s 2013 by throwing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention, this time against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius appeal from which they say that it is too lenient.
The National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to the South Africa Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of being increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg.
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the quarter-clanters from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and into secondary schools.
Three of the school students will go to the school in the future, four to the real school.
Schulleiterin Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol for school leaving, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm, but then released into freedom.
To this end, the muntere Schar introduced a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it erupt from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken hunter, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was shattered, the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain.
After that, the classes showed three and four in the graduation of Yvonne Frank a chicken.
The hens danced with the young gockles, the cylinders carried to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said Schulleiterin Angelika Sitte.
The boy is different from the other boys (chicks), but belongs to them.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His rule is to be free.
She wished every four clerks that he felt accepted in his new school.
I would like to thank my fellow Members, former schoolmaster Michael Müller, who has repeatedly jumped into teaching bottlenecks and the parents' representatives.
Sophia Schumacher explained the school's teacher.
They leave their students very odd after two years of teaching, because it was really a great time.
Finally, they have been able to rely on the four-legged clandestine.
At the end of the day, all students had a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy among children.
Eight first clampers have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited by television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people living illegally were arrested in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is under way.
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camps and put significant fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the people affected now need to know?
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 cars.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives you an assessment:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have thrust software", says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has ordered the KBA.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has announced that he will write to all interested parties.
If an inspection is due anyway, that will be done within its framework.
How long should the overall changeover take?
"Hey to say", says Smetanin.
This depends on the manufacturer's commitment and on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE avenues for waiting.
Presumably, foreign manufacturers would follow, Smetanin said.
Is there a massive drop in the price of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J gets Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious awards of the Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95).
Give the awards at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award ceremony with his wife Melania.
The winner Lear, known with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
The "New York Times" he said: "This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and this is a burden on me".
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, will retire next year.
The job is already posted - suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work still gives him great fun as he conveys in the press talks.
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successors.
At the same time, he is amazed that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible time.
In this way - taking into account the regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a review.
Since Haslach acts as a sub-contractor for the administrative community, the applicant must present appropriate qualifications.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they were no longer able to fill them, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the people is important to the city and to the city itself, says Wacker, who reports of a good working climate and good mood between the authority and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have been accumulated, with pride on the Wacker.
"We make the city worth living", he is sure about the building office and its staff.
In the future, however, there are also varied projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, are initiated.
The cinematic bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter, with around EUR 1.5 million, will hit the bill, 'if we do it properly', Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successors.
The work here is fun. '
There is a lot of room for a town builder.
Haslach ’ s own farm and gardening can be reacted to a great deal of flexibility.
"You can move a lot", so Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often commended by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to have an eye for what suits "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing town builder stresses.
In any case, the mayor bears a high responsibility.
He is a builder, "in the end everything runs over my table".
He can count on many years of work in the field of supervision and coordination: Markus Neumaier (building) has been in the process for ten years, Manfred Schöner (underground building) has been in the process for 15 years.
Also that his successor stays long, Wacker wants: "We are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the job".
For continuity is important not only for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed degree as a graduate or a Bachelor with a technical orientation in architecture and have a good knowledge of construction and construction planning law.
The City Building Office is subject to high and low construction, construction management, basic employment matters, administration of urban properties, urban farm with Bauhof and Stadtgärtnerei as well as suburban construction authority including monument protection.
Cycling on lines: Southern railway track closed.
According to the police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the freight train approaching had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the site there were witnesses of a rosaroter roller and a bicycle driver observed.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich", said ÖBB precher Christoph Posch to APA.
The perpetrators, or the perpetrators, would have put themselves at great risk and endangered rail transport as well.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail passenger transport, passenger cars could also be made available to the perpetrators.
Overall, the speaker said to be 'significant'.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, and rail transport on the southern route could be carried without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had lapsed on Friday morning, two of them related to long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fall, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 meters of overhead lines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The incurable state affecting some 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK causes stomach vampses and leaves, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote tolerant intestinal.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory disease.
Experiments found that a kind of tolerant immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their inputs.
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiomass, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells.
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in Tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal, if the same system also affects humans.
The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immunal cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was housed separately, did not do so..
She suspected that the difference was with the intestinal robioms of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice ’ s dams were sequenced to DNA, and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing from the mice.
mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a intestinal robiom, and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system, researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned out of fluid, it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan-Metabolism, known as Indol-3 dairy acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in mice ’ s feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50%, but if the Tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach intestinal tracts.
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to Tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high Tryptophane values in the present of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed Nemanja Matic to a "genius".
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genius", Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40 million signature of Chelsea began with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
Matic, however, was excluded from the preparation tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted had to improve before the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football", said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
Besides Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium as a Mourinho his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to meet three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have taken great trouble."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the Sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US, these are several thousand kilometres.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens the form of a Dreamliner was to be.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Boeing had already made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky.
New Deal for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem.
As the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still the leader of the SPD, Social Democratic Prime Minister always looked at Berlin with some concern.
The most important desire of the campaign campaigners was not just a headwind from the federal government.
This has changed radically since Martin Schulz leads the party.
Since then, the people from the Willy-Brandt House have been observing the events in the SPD-ruled capitals of the country.
What Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with headwinds.
These were deep strikes.
One after the other.
The Bundes-CDU looks after the surprising end of the rot-green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red Green simply cannot govern reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber of the German editorial network (RND).
The surprising group leak from a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis..,,,,,,,,,,
Five months before the country ’ s election, his red-green coalition thus lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition.
The Green Leader, Michael Kellner, has called on the breakaway Lower Saxony Green Deputy Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate ’ s will.
Elke Twesten must return her mandate immediately, "said the German Federal Business Leader and campaign leader of the Greens to the German editorial network (RND).
"That must not be true at all," a SPD campaigner, as the new Hiobsbotschaft reached the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there without a government majority following the arrival of the Green MEP Elke Twesten.
It is the interim culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The plight began with the unexpected defeat of the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, more not, calmed the comrades at the time.
After the general election in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It was then made much worse - and that was all very much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the baptismal, the Dusseldorf bankrupt swept the.
In the weeks after that, the comrades rapped up again.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, the G-20 summit in Hamburg came.
And with him came the next blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus this weekend because he sat in Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because, in crisis communication, he then made quite everything wrong that can be done wrong.
Since then Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust affair and its role in the supervisory board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticising for some time.
Miese surveys were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because, in recent weeks, it has been increasingly trying to set accents in the covenant.
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was also not concealed in the context of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to grant him because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because there is basically no fault of the Lower Saxony Greens' internal division.
And Schulz is not at all..,,,,,,,,,,
For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Your anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and democratic, as Mrs Twesten puts her own careers' interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the Party Left in the SPD Bundestagsfraktion, the German editorial network (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the regional list of the Lower Saxony Greens.
The logical consequence would be for them to return their mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestagsfraktion, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The electorate ’ s will was clear four years ago: people made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now, the personal careers of a future CDU MEP distorts the election result," said Oppermann.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further pledges made by the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Funding for Ortskern III
Anyone who wants to rehabilitate his house in the years can soon receive support from the country.
Furthermore, the mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
For Schindler, the previous remedies are a 'success project' - it is important, after all, to promote internal development as well, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On April 4, the President of the Government of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The amount of funding amounted to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country, the rest of the municipality of Empfingen.
What is the result of a rehabilitation area?
You will continue to investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest at all in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial borders could then be postponed again.
The STEC represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder-Programm "Soziale Stadt", where the remedies would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is to revitalise urban areas, improve living and working conditions and maintain and develop infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out objectively, that is, per land.
The recovery area would then be defined as a statute.
The grant period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
By September this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, in which the parties involved in the recovery area would receive a questionnaire.
In November or December, as far as possible, the decision on the statute will be adopted so that the remedies can be started next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that any local authority had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is about evaluating and deciding when to restructure urban planning.
It will also be registered in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come again to Empfingen and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that the project is a key success factor for the participation.
That is why there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet", which deals, among other things, with the building state and the restoration plans.
In grey questionnaires, the "household and housing arch", information on the size, distribution and residents of a residence can be made.
The blue "operating arc" is only to be filled when business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time.
Moreover, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler still emphasized that the distribution of subsidies according to the "greyhound principle" - who comes first, mahlt first.
You can't reserve any funds for later.
At the end, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make the present a restoration "tasty".
British inventor sets himself up a microchip to get home and car with a hand movement.
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisor at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam would also like to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military ’ s data left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and White House senior officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries.
The Connecticut helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a fire-fighter from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July, at 7 am, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for return flight due to the limitation of hours.
The original flight crew was on the helicopter during the event, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground at the plane during the time.
The records made available by the TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate the rule.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"If you are closed," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave impetus to the reform of health reform, which was under way in the Senate, and he advocated efforts to curb government rules.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous ends.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But to demand their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential aircraft ran in Melbourne, Florida against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 countries made by American workers with American materials", said Deputy Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to set US President in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted when training requires the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant.
In addition, helicopter units flew 11 hours on this day for 'non-presidential support missions'.
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other requirements presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have budgeting for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to hourly rates of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year, however, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour of flight.
Recordings of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"The cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for refunds is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this'.
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he came to South Lawn for the event, but he moved to the driver seat of a fire-fighting car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky ’ s representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss ’ s Tricky Task
Top runner of the second tennis league will appear at the table third viewfinder SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss starts tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table third viewfinder SV.
Despite five matches, the top runner of the second tennis league still has an impeccable record.
Team chef Marius Zay, however, has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formations.
I find the team very good, especially on the back positions. '
For class and stability in the search village SV, especially imports from the high north.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the double, "says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"As always, this is difficult for us.
You also need a good portion of luck. '
The Neusser team for the trip in the high north is practically standing.
His blue-white debut could give Maxime Janvier.
If the currently active Frenchman is not part of the Bundesliga-Partie at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella, the Czech Liberec competition Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) will take part in his first match this season.
The hitherto unwon Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still in Kitzbühel with the Belarus Andrei Vasilevski at at the AT.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could join again.
Sufficient for the 18-year-olds Hungary, who was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, does not fill someone from the trainer ’ s chair around Marius Zay.
How America can harm OMV
Indeed, Donald Trump was not happy when he signed on Wednesday to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his haste to enact the law," Congress has packed a few "unconstitutional rules", he estimated.
The response from Moscow, too, was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US push.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors from the domestic OMV, which, together with other European companies, co-financed the construction of the Baltic Sea Stream 2.
Drohkulisse is enormous.
However, it is too early to assess the impact, the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to raise sanctions by an executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"The press" has looked at which the Group could defend itself and which could really awaken it.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is placed at the center of the Netflix series.
Despite the second season of Narcos, which revealed Pablo Escobars Killer, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The staging three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest males of the show.
With the third season, DEA has focused its attention on the world ’ s richest drug trafficking organization: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful patrons, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, who invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city employs 46 kitchen aids.
The city organizes the Kita lunchtime again.
With strong contacts for the children and a assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban nursery sites.
As of 1 September, Krefeld will take over the food supply in urban children ’ s daycare facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Director of Youth Assistance, this is good news: "We were all very pleased".
Coke is still out of house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked.
In the Krefeld area, the city operates 46 daycare centres, in 44 children get a warm meal for lunch.
In the last Kitajahr, 2800 children were sitting on the tables, and demand is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week have lunch in Kita," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour service when children stay until 2 p.m.".
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service from 1 September: they heat up the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, carry the meal individually, leave the food, wash it and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are assigned to a kita", says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides on the hourly range.
"The kitchen helpers now belong firmly to the Kita team", says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for Kitaleitung".
This is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"Children should help prepare food".
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Also for children.
"You have a known force in the kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the job of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, besides improving the quality of the kitchen, also the charm it has shown in comparing costs between ownership and outsourcing for the city as the most economical, is the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are being reset.
"But these hours are not so important to some 750 people in the educational field," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, President-in-Office of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will stand in the provinces in the Council elections, with three women standing for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be handed over peacefully by a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan ’ s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men are trying to wipe out 13-year-old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to deprive a 13-year-old girl.
According to information from the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who had met friends at the Kolping Street, about 14.55, because they wanted to telephone the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and continued with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to pick up the cell phone and the girl's neck, but that was not so long.
Without prey, the Duo fled.
The two young men could be arrested later by the police.
The investigations are under way.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure that the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie's long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be the first to know if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's manager, GMB Scotland McVitie's called for 'concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines would not be pushed forward'.
GMB seniors organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Secretary about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here, and workers are focusing heavily on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
That is why, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie.
A spokesperson in Pladis said: "The Filialleiter at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly because we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where a number of issues were discussed openly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We discussed with the staff that we, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She added: 'In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross-site site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site, and if our operating processes change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this.
Has the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago about Ney?
The La Liga side may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not fall in its pursuit of Neymar, having made an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the World Record?
The sensational approach fueled the summer transfer window, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record for more than twice the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After the end, Neymar will become the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest paid professional sportsman.
Barcelona is furious about how Neymar forced his way out, even though a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to deal with it since its arrival in Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City declared interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, that will have consequences. '
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club beginning this summer expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International to travel from Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Reversed and damaged Roller
In the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator has deliberately thrown a scooter in the Königsfeld street in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to the vehicle from more than EUR 200.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, asks for hints.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because he had a car on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and touched the board.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum, with his VW at 19.55, was on the B 215 from Stolzenau, heading towards Leese.
In the area of Stolzenau, a car came up against him on his road so that he had to turn right.
At the same time, the tour operator touched the track schedule.
The damage caused by the car came into being.
The driver of the upcoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
It may be good, according to the accident, that the Mercedes-Benz driver had not even noticed the accident.
The police are now asking the witnesses of the incident, as well as the driver of the polluter's experience, to contact the Commissioner at Stolzenau at 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen Report relieves Papst-brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Papst-brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weisnder, Speaker of the Reforming Movement "We are Church", explained after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritated Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their misappraisal of what happened at the time.
The Vatican Council, on the other hand, criticized "Osservatore Romano" for having double standards in reporting on violence in the domain.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it would be 'shameful and shameful acts' that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but the 'degree of media manipulation', the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal", writes Scaraffia.
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerische Rundfunk: "You are happy to go to the church and that is a attached frescoes".
She also pointed out that, in her youth, 'a quite normal pedagogical tool' was in order to cope with french children, as I was, '.
They would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on cases of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Unjustifiably, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorial band "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages),.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I must protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him", he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?
A total of 547 Regensburg domains were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 domains.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "In summary, it can be said that in many cases, Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence.
Particularly with high emotionality, punishment for the pupils could also be more severe.
Despite this, contrary to many other accusations, many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even have positive memories with him.
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger, in his opinion, relieved.
Mr Hesemann, the 440 page report on the 'acts of violence against defensive persons in the Regensburger Domspatzen' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist, who became more handgrip when a dome did not perform musically.
How do you view this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is actually there.
Eight pages have just been devoted to it, and it is clear that every suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse has been released.
The violence of the preschool also took place outside its sphere of action.
You can accuse him of being too late or of not taking the first indications seriously enough.
The domain narrative on which he acted was perceived by virtually all respondents as "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also exhibits an excellent testimony, describing him as a "warm-hearted", "sincere", "competent" and "sympathetic", as a highly tireless teacher who regularly sent the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbonbons and was "always surrounded by children's grapes".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to excesses.
He has expressed deep regret and apologies to him not only with stools and threw the key league on the ground, but also distributed ear cowardly and excused young boys to the hair or ears.
But his salvation of honor must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question, the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s, among parents and teachers.
Do you also know such ignition methods?
Of course, I think each of us born before 1968.
I too have seen this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
Compared with what this report is about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence on the pre-school, these are, of course, dreadful.
This is where one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him.
After all, many of the Bavarian popes who have never understood him are still working diligently.
The truth is, however, that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a great deal has been said about the issue of abuse in the Regensburger domain lanes in connection with the report.
Will Georg Ratzinger, in the final report, also be charged with any involvement or participation in sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: No.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the domain master.
Not even the parents were consecrated.
"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said a affected deputy for the others, "I was very embarrassing".
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, it is certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator.
How do I assess Ratzinger ’ s role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: As a questioned student put it, "Regarding sexual abuse... do not see a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrators.
I also think it is really absurd to assume that he... has opened a bunch more intrusive or clearer or more open than to their parents, internship managers, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion: 'The fact that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to them in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation'.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, therefore, Georg Ratzinger is to be released from any fellowship.
Nor can it be accused of preventing or displaying it.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these appalling crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, much of "Gewaltexzessen" was to be read in the Regensburger domain lanes.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of looking the way in the report.
Do he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything has been mixed and merged into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
After all, there is a clear separation between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the domain lanes, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir manager of the domain tracks.
The whole dreadful caning pedagogy, the cases in which infusions of sadistic teachers were truly harassed and maltreated, all occurred on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions have to prevail.
However, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the dome encymnasium.
In this, as most witnesses emphasize, the theme "pre-school" was taboo.
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.
What was different about the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: While there was discipline, there was no sadistic violence.
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that 'many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories link with him'.
At the most, the accusation remains to be swept away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the conditions on the pre-school.
For the first time in 1970 / 71, when he just started to establish himself and was not responsible for the events at a school where he had just not worked and was not responsible (so the witness), and then only about 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears before the states?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as long ago as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this, he points out that 'caning is still practised in the pre-school'.
In the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when caning was banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they were in a legal grey area, as everyone knows.
It was difficult for him, too, to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where the permitted limit had actually been exceeded.
However, we cannot say that he has always looked away.
That is simply not true.
In 1980, caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating past by moral standards today.
The princes are right here.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which was odious at all times, nor to what was hidden in the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children ’ s souls, which goes far beyond what was then common practice.
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out.
At the same time, however, I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is to say slap and draw on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
As a physical punishment, he has also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his Regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger give in talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?
Can the subject of caning also be discussed?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, because the domains played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and bonbons alone, you will not be a big singer or any success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
When what kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and have always seen him as a wonderful, humorous, ground-like, deeply believing and heartfelt person, one of whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything except a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former domains still today, 23 years after his emergency, keep in contact with him regularly, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
So those who have not forgiven him until now that he was too strict are clearly in the minority.
Most of the domains are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music closer to them.
And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also an affectionate respect to which he was still standing up today and which he almost honoured.
And I would ask you, once again, to make it quite clear that everything you accuse him is a method of education that was on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media scapegoat.
It is all too obvious that there is a bad intention behind it.
The report that has just been published relieves it.
Now the decency would finally lead to a 93-year-old man who has gained a great deal of merit and who, without knowing the domains of Regensburg, would not yet be in peace without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany.
