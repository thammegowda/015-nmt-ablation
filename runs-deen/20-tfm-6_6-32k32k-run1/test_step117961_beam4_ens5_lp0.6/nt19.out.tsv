The damage caused by the fire still needs to be identified , as does the cause of the fire .	-3.8132
It should be considerable , however , because the owner had many collectors ' items in his garden hut .	-5.9848

He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them .	-2.9749
At present , Bram Schol is Head of Sales as Commissioner .	-6.0961
Due to the change to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP , production losses at Audi , Schot said the " Heilbronner Vote " .	-13.1645
Basically , he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6 , A7 and A8 , which are produced in Neckarsulm .	-3.7226
" The segment itself is difficult , " he said .	-1.7006
Schot relies on electromobility .	-2.6115

Mainz ( dpa ) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for the position of DFB president again despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair next year .	-5.4554
" I do my job and try to do it as well as possible , " said Grindel as a guest on Sunday morning at the " Aktuelle Sportshodio " of the ZDF .	-4.9238
Time and again we have to seek re-election , which I shall do .	-7.1808
And then you have to look at whether the support is there .	-3.9976
According to his own words , the head of the association would find it ' strange ' if , after winning the European Football Championship in 2024 , he did not ' want to work on the project for the future ' .	-6.7816
Since April 2016 , Grindel has been head of the association as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach , overthrown by the summer fairytale affair .	-4.5623
In the fall of 2016 , he was elected for a first full term of three years .	-2.3335
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019 .	-2.4981
According to Grindel , Philipp Lahm , the future head of the European Parliament , is to work with the DFB Presidency .	-7.1376
" I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to advise the Bureau in this role and will of course be warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues , " Grindel said .	-6.3553
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB .	-4.5030
As a consequence of the affair of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan ’ s photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migrant background should become DFB integration ambassador .	-5.5654
Currently , this office is run by native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic , who have family roots in Cameroon .	-4.6026
" If a person without a migrant background has a clear influence on society and football and says , " the issue is important , we have to take care of it " , this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs , where integration must work , " Grindel said .	-6.8911
Taking Down with Half-wise Balance	-5.7698
I have had a new toy for four weeks .	-5.9534
A scale that measures not only my weight , but also the body fat part .	-8.7418
It can also display muscle and bone mass .	-2.4937
The body mass index also calculates the thing , but it is more for the sausages .	-4.2138
Does he say nothing about whether I have replaced fat with muscles ?	-4.1373

Criticism of Germany	-1.3293
In his opening speech , Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite followers of the Gülen movement living in Germany and take action against Kurdish separatists .	-3.4405
We will protect our citizens wherever they live .	-1.6031
We will not allow PKK or Gülen movement sympathizers to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship , " he said .	-3.1547
The city centre of Cologne was partially closed for the opening of the Ditib Mosque .	-3.6302
Several thousand police officers were deployed - including snipers .	-3.4365
The Ditib Islamic Association is in criticism because it is considered to be an extension of the Turkish Government .	-4.6972
Global Citizen Festival : Music Against Poverty : Stars , Buhrufe and Schreckseconde	-2.9614
Musicians such as Janet Jackson , John Legend , Shawn Mendes , and Cardi B have promoted greater commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in Central Park in New York .	-8.4322
" Get involved wherever you can , " said Mendes at the festival during the night to Sunday in front of some 60,000 spectators .	-5.9243
Thank you for coming here , this is a dream .	-2.2688
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone .	-2.5090
I am nervous , I sweat , but it is okay , because I am here and ready to change the world .	-2.2522
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker , as well as representatives of governments , the United Nations and aid agencies , also took part in the multi-hour spectacle .	-4.1239
In the meantime , however , there was a second of horror when many spectators felt that the noise of a metal barrier was shooting , becoming frightened and trying to escape .	-8.2558
In short , panic arose , people ran into confusion .	-2.9486
Seven spectators were easily injured , said the organizer Hugh Evans .	-3.5203
The New York police and musicians Chris Martin then calmed people off the stage .	-3.9955
" Nobody is trying to injure anyone , " Martin said .	-2.3754
You are all in safety .	-6.6033
Tickets for the " Global Citizen Festival " concert were available as every year for free on the Internet .	-3.8191
Anyone who wanted to get one had to read and distribute texts , photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease .	-4.7822
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - Buhrufe , on the other hand , for Republican Senator Jeff Flake .	-4.5255
He spoke with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for greater equality between men and women .	-4.2573
On Friday , however , in the Senate Judicial Committee , Flake pronounced himself in favour of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court , thereby alienating many women .	-6.9635
At least three women have made allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh , which he rejects .	-3.9653
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women who , according to their own data , had themselves experienced sexual assaults , confronted him in a lift on the way to committee meeting .	-7.1311
" You can also meet me at any time in an elevator , " said Flake at the New York concert .	-4.6530
Press freedom : German government defends .	-2.9841
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert defended the ouster of a journalist at the press conference of German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan .	-2.9816
At the Chancellery , the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription " Freedom for Journalists " and went to the front row .	-5.6214
The t-shirt , was not the problem , said Seibert the picture on Sunday .	-6.3753
It was a question of disturbing the running of the press conference .	-4.1911
The action of the journalist caused a great deal of unrest , which is unacceptable .	-5.0744
That is why he has led people to get the man out .	-6.2073
Seibert said that it is not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery .	-3.3865
This applies completely irrespective of whether this is a legitimate concern or not .	-4.0206
The rules are the rules .	-0.6321
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey .	-2.1311
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or of supporting or joining banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement .	-3.5475
Turkey ’ s leaders blame the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15 , 2016 .	-1.7452
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with several decades of imprisonment .	-3.0087
Foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities either : the Austrian journalist Max Zirnguest was arrested only in early September .	-3.4602
Most recently , the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir .	-3.4202
They were free and able to return to Germany , but there are still trials in Turkey against the two .	-8.9787
Munich : Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller	-2.2707
His fans usually know him as fresh and good as Florian David Fitz .	-3.2190
We have to look at this twice : yes , that really is Florian David Fitz .	-4.0683
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night !	-2.2397
Hamburg - Die vom NDR produzierte Talkshow " Inas Nacht " ist für damit freiwillige Gespräche an der Hamburger Hafenkneipe " Schellfischposten " bekannt .	-4.9531
Host Ina Müller and her guests meet up with some beer , some wine or even more important drinks to relax the mood and tongues .	-6.5871
Not a few celebrities drink courage even for the obligatory vocal inserts .	-5.3861
On Friday , another episode of the popular talk show was recorded .	-6.1408
This time : actor Florian David Fitz is famous for films such as " Men 's Heart " , " Terror - Your Judgment " or " The Best Day " .	-5.3362
However , the trip to the far north of Munich did not get very good .	-9.3169
On Saturday he posted a Selfie - his face is completely broken on it , his eyes are only two small slits .	-5.4736
The bed elfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz .	-5.5808
But he is not ill , he only has a powerful hangover .	-3.0463
To his fans he posted some - probably not very serious - insights he has now gained : " Rule one : NIE goes to Ines night .	-6.2202
Rule two : never drinks the black sauce .	-2.0576
And syringe .	-1.0801
And the round of eggshells , which Ina tastes by half three , also leaves . .	-10.2627
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old .	-3.8790
His fans immediately posted some tips to combat the aftershocks .	-4.6512
They ranged from instant brooch , fish brooch , or , probably the most effective , headache pills .	-7.6168
Others simply amused themselves by the sight of the usually attractive movie star .	-3.4358
How Ina Müller survived the nightly sucking party is unknown .	-5.9286
Since she has been hosting the TV fun at the bar since 2007 , the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested ...	-5.4984
On a beer with Ina Müller .	-1.0274
Treysa Fights with Vandalism and Treysa	-2.8249
The entrance to the 36 km railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired .	-12.7269
Recipes of rampant vandalism are being sought , but solutions are hardly emerging .	-4.1551
Shears , cigarette dumps , garbage and rubbish , demolished dustbins and now dismantled signposts - this is the way to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa .	-9.0881
For the flagship railway cycle track in the Rotkäppchenland a more than disgraceful sight .	-6.4292
Members of the ADFC village group Schwalmstadt have been working on the subject for a long time , however , according to the city ’ s cycling officer Ulrich Wüstenhagen .	-8.4074
The issue has already been raised in the cycling board .	-4.1540
There is no solution .	-2.0008
The proposals range from laying the seating group to regularly removing waste containers and cleaning areas at the entry point .	-5.1079
" I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities , " says desert havoc .	-4.5377
Guido Hahn ( ADFC ) reports that the topic has also been included in the local advisory board .	-3.7546
It is not only the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the group of seats is a regular meeting place for celebrations at weekends .	-5.3756
Not only do things go out loud , but the gelages are also destroyed : posts are torn out of the ground , garbage bins are demolished , signs are kneaded , seating furniture is smeared .	-10.5002
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often , says ADFC member Susanne Klippert .	-3.8311
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean .	-3.3427
You are annoyed that the resting place at the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for the birds of prey .	-6.2210
" Along the entire cycle path there is a clear focus here on the Haaße hill " , confirms the cyclist representative , who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain , which is being opened today .	-8.5408
" If she suffers the same fate , it will be quite expensive " .	-3.9547
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill : " Perhaps this will raise the threshold to encroach on the common good .	-8.7860
However , this would require a police force to pass a police force in time .	-6.8024
In general , deserts want to see a development of the Hasse hill .	-6.0386
It must be made more attractive .	-1.4184
The frequency of the cycle path so far can be very satisfied .	-4.1020
Tourist marketing is still open to further development .	-4.1446
Our cycling path is of high quality compared to others in Germany " , says the ADFC members .	-4.3662
ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa as a very critical danger .	-6.1387
There is no bending on the Haaße hill .	-4.7288
In the case of heavy traffic , cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flow on both sides , " she explains .	-5.2347
That would not be a problem for sportsmen , but it would be a problem for the elderly and , in particular , for children .	-4.1354
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof : The " Kö von Hiltrup " and the lake .	-3.4031
The first call to the music contest was a success , creative and in collaboration .	-2.5290
" D a song for Hiltrup " is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive , in the " Music Contest for large and small , young and experienced musicians " .	-4.9181
A contest " with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family " , as Karl Franke put it .	-3.1739
In fact , it was soon a family get-together with coffee and cake from the official official office of the Cultural Station .	-5.9024
Seven formations took place , from the one-man band to the great ensemble : Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied , Henk Humberg with guitar , Rolf Ihmig , a long albachtener living in Hiltrup , the nine of the " Hiltruper Sterndyen " , three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus , an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwickies .	-6.7167
This contest , according to district mayor Joachim Schmidt , is a novelty .	-3.1088
We have not seen this in other parts of the city .	-3.0072
What did the text relate to ?	-3.4175
In the villages Hiltruper See and Marktallee were mentioned very often .	-5.9817
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his striking song to the " Kö von Hiltrup " .	-3.6777
The cultural railway station has also been acknowledged .	-7.1909
Time and again it was about experiencing coexistence in these places , especially with Alvin Jasic .	-4.9858
Karl Franke animated the short break with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about their work .	-4.6881
This was how Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry , but now also taught guitar .	-5.3539
Frank was informed by sound engineer Stefan Schemelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest .	-5.7864
Meanwhile , Alvin Jasic has placed a lot on Youtube .	-3.8290
" It 's not about profits , " Franke said .	-2.9403
In fact , all participants received a gift from Hiltruper gastronomy .	-3.2755
However , there was something special for the jury ’ s favourites – so that others can also listen to their songs .	-5.9688
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemelmann .	-3.5958
Other musicians can record a song : Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager , who impressed Franke especially with his musicality , and the " Lummerland-Rudel " : " a very beautiful performance " with ten children and two teachers of guitar and cajon , Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle .	-4.8609
Like everyone else , the children appeared again at the final - and even sounded " really good " , as Franke said , without electronic support .	-5.7164
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality , relation to Hiltrup , uniqueness of the melody and recognition value .	-3.9073
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westfälischen Schule für Musik , Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund and Jan Kaven , chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive .	-3.8286
The Urban Offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence .	-5.4550
She regarded the event as a complete success .	-3.5363
All were " very satisfied " , and " the atmosphere was good " in the soon very full cultural station .	-3.8939
The Game of Word : Decrypto in the Game Test	-8.2311
The players form two teams that are sitting opposite each other .	-4.1914
There is a visual umbrella for each page , four cards with keywords , which you can decipher when you put them in - the old trick with the slide .	-7.3494
This ensures that the other side can read nothing by mistake .	-3.5357
On the cards , for example , read from left to right : " 1st Renaissance .	-4.0812
2 . Window .	-1.1081
3 .	-1.2666
4 . Fest ' .	-1.5151
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on .	-3.0902
For here we should not guess the terms , but codes .	-4.4405
The encryption is alternately one player per team .	-4.0000
He gets a code card which may contain " 3.4.2 " .	-3.8741
In " Decrypto " you should not guess the terms behind the secret foil , but their encryption codes .	-4.7581
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms " dice " , " feast " and " windows " - in such a way that his own team will recognize the correct order and the opposing team will not be able to do so , because that is what the game wins if it succeeds twice in cracking the code .	-8.2713
So the cipher writes and reads aloud : " throwing " for the dice , " lots " as a contrast to festival ; here , of course , something like " party " would be possible and " Prague " because he was careful in school and knows the fall of the windows there .	-7.4480
This is the way round by round , team by team .	-4.9038
You don 't know the terms of the other side - but you can better summarize them with any reference that the encryption gives there .	-8.2681
As mysterious as possible , but not too twisted , the characters should be , otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team .	-7.1216
The most cryptic of " decrypto " is unfortunately the rule book .	-3.7342
The players will probably have to study it for quite long and long until they can finally play .	-8.2127
The explanatory video under decrypto.info on the net makes it easier .	-2.5094
But once you have got started , you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this incredible game .	-6.8407
But " decrypto " is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre primus " codenames " , which also puts an agency theme on a game of few words but is much better to play in small groups .	-6.6385
And to whom it is only a matter of rats and not a matter of victory points , it is also easy to invent one version for two .	-5.7825
Kulmbach : Man zeigt Polizei Hitlergruß und harten Gäste in der Kneipe .	-4.2333
A 48-year-old man employed the police officer Kulmbach twice on the night of Saturday to Sunday .	-3.7142
First he showed Hitler 's greeting in the Upper City of a police force passing by , then later he also fell in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests .	-7.1940
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police , he had to spend the night at the police inspectorate Kulmbach in the prison cell .	-6.2569
In a sober state , he must also be prosecuted for using signs of unconstitutional organisations .	-5.9008
Pressig ’ s Works Works Works Home	-5.7400
The railway plant in Prestig was the hub of the Frankenwald for decades .	-4.5695
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended .	-2.4448
" When buffers cracked buffers , they heard it in a very pressing manner , " remembers Georg Dinkel , who archives the history of the town and the railway station .	-5.8532
That did not inspire anyone .	-2.9868
There , the brakes soar and the wagons cracked .	-5.7607
That was pure railway .	-3.0934
Speeches that symbolically represent Dinkel ’ s homeland of Pressig .	-5.0754
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railways .	-4.2053
Here was the starting point for the Steilrampen mountain route to the north , which after an increase of about 220 metres has its peak in Steinbach am Wald .	-6.0252
In order to cope with this , trains and thrust blocks were needed in the past , which had their home in Prestig .	-7.2050
In 1901 , the Bavarian Parliament approved the construction of a railway station with 21 locomotives , a training-station , a train station and a railway station .	-6.8354
" The centerpiece was the hub , which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899 , " says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid , a railway historian and a professional railway engineer for 47 years .	-5.2614
From the railway plant ( BW ) Pressig , which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968 , locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau , Ludwigsstadt - Lehsten , Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalb were also operated .	-5.9564
On July 15 , 1950 , the " Volksblatt " reported a staff of 160 men ; 13 steam and eight Ellaks were stationed in Prestig .	-5.5292
The electrification of the track in 1939 already minimized the need for drawers and drawers .	-3.8947
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains .	-3.1134
By 1991 at least 10 000 weighing was still placed in the month .	-4.8805
In 1982 , parts of the plant were cut off , and in 1991 the rest was cut off .	-5.6119
Heidrich : ' It is regrettable that we have not envisaged better use of the site , including in the area of freight transport ' .	-4.9468
On Whitsun 1989 , the Nürnberg railway management celebrated the anniversary of " 50 years of electrification Nürnberg - Saalfeld " a pompous train station festival in Pressig .	-10.3941
" There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here , " recalls Georg Dinkel .	-3.0124
Not long after the end .	-2.9575
On June 1 , 1991 , the last 30 men were taken away , the shunting station of Pressig was history . . . . . , , and .	-9.9658
" The Rangers and Hemmings did the most difficult work in rail transport , " says Dinkel .	-6.0619
Any failure would have had fatal consequences .	-2.0637

China Open	-2.5761
Beijing ( dpa ) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round in the tennis tournament in Beijing , just like Julia Görges .	-4.2062
Kerber won the China Open 6 : 2 , 6 : 2 against the French woman Kristina Mladenovic .	-2.3840
The next opponent of the third world ranking list is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro .	-4.1726
Siegemund führte 6 : 3 , 4 : 2 gegen Darja Kassatkina , als die an Number 13 gesetzte Russin aufgab .	-2.8635

During the series " Art and Pleasure " a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelenbach .	-5.2803
With great relief registered organisers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special opening ceremony " Windspiel-Performance " was opened in the premises of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt , Mittelfrehnbach .	-7.1199
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association " Around the Walberla " in the " Art and Pleasure " series .	-4.9730
It opened its doors in the 15th year .	-2.2432
The fascination of the exhibition demonstrated a great interest in the exhibition .	-4.7742
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be seen in Mittelhonnbach .	-4.5292
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage .	-2.9585
He has been there since the first hour .	-3.2035
Like Volker Hahn , who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist .	-4.0201
A little surprising but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago .	-2.4398
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer , however , he placed his task in tried and tested young hands with good prospects for the future .	-4.4072
In the past , both have been actively involved in the selection of artists and have helped to design flyers .	-6.0609
This year , too , there is another 70-cent special belt designed for art & pleasure , available at every art station .	-7.9272
This year 's poster " Betzn austanzen " , designed by Volker Hahn , can also be purchased for eight euros .	-4.1747
Hahn was delighted with the high approval of the special exhibition .	-3.9790
Max Marcus Stadler from Nürnberg was able to be won for the musical environment .	-9.5588
When walking through the spacious garden , the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title " Windplay Performance " formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way .	-6.5460
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics , often with coloured accents .	-3.9874
Already at the entrance of the property , the visitor on the right side of the " Glücksbaum " awaits the artist Werner Baur , Eschenau .	-3.9458
It is a tree stump , brightly coloured , playful with 20 windmills , 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes .	-4.0149
With the sun blowing through the bushwerk in the background , the object looks fairytale and invites you to linger .	-5.5908
Barbara Washneck comes from Eckental , who prefers to dedicate himself to the event 15 years K & G in three-dimensional letters .	-6.4379
There are many parts in the wind in motion .	-1.9010
On the half way , Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work " Der Wind das Himmerlichche Kind " .	-4.5706
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy building made of clay , cement and stainless steel .	-3.8260
The theme " Windplay Performance " for the softening through the versatile art exhibition .	-6.1728
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018 .	-2.6170
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten : Singers celebrate their 50th birthday .	-4.1150
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement .	-2.7670
And the Albachten also gave air to their displeasure .	-4.4386
At least five of them .	-0.7155
They simply did not want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir " Cäcilia " there should be no more Sangesleben in the district .	-7.0304
It has now become a legend : at a bank in the Tinnenbusch , they launched the MGV 68 Albachten .	-4.4018
That was 50 years ago .	-0.7465
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the " Haus der Begegnung " .	-3.9598
" It will be full today , " said Chairman Jürgen Holsteige , and he should be right .	-3.9752
There were 150 guests , a real success for the Albachten singers .	-2.6383
Their jubilee was the anniversary of the foundation .	-6.2165
For years it was tradition , then there was a break .	-3.6889
The traditional festival was back in time for the 50th anniversary .	-3.8519
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothing had been previously .	-2.9750
The guests did not sit in rows like usual in the " Haus der Begegnung " , but sit comfortably at tables .	-6.0858
Between now and then , movement was the order of the day : DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln moved the knobs and asked for the dance floor .	-6.2518
Honorary cause that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten themselves made the voice heard .	-5.5647
It was a good occasion to hear cheerful songs .	-7.1284
Almost already set : " A day as beautiful as today " .	-4.7826
The " Rüdesheim Wine " was suitable for the exquisite wine juice that many had in front of them .	-5.8988
In allusion to another cool drink , " Humulus lupulus " , which is the Latin term for " hops " .	-4.4379
Again sovereign was the choir direction of Richard Homann , one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time .	-5.0643
" It 's just fun to sing under his leadership , " Holsteege said : " He has such an easy way , it 's a masterpiece he performs " .	-6.3588
The female choir " Hohes C " was also a guest , whose repertoire includes Evergreen 's repertoire from the 1920s to the 1960s .	-5.4421
Finally , there was poetry .	-2.0369
Singer Theo Weber had sat at his desk until three o 'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes .	-3.9750
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine poetry art .	-2.5385
There was also a big raffle .	-1.7669
The proceeds are intended to finance the children of the Albatros Youth Center a visit to the all-weather zoo .	-4.1235

Volleyball : 3rd League Women : USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee .	-2.7894
The climber marches .	-1.7839
Three games , three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really well placed in league three .	-5.4404
No trace of Sheu or Frackshausen , the independents do their thing .	-3.4849
And that 's good at 3 : 0 ( 25 : 15 , 25 : 23 , 26 : 24 ) against city competitor BW Aasee .	-3.8690
" This was not crystal clear , but we have already left an impression , " says the reasonably satisfied trainer .	-4.2575
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed : " This is a defeat with which we can live very well .	-2.8003
We are not dissatisfied ' ; on the contrary .	-2.1880
In the evening , Ronja de Boer ’ s birthday party was a good time for the game .	-7.3659
Yes , the result is indeed an optical illusion .	-2.2822
In the third set the guests had a satzball .	-2.9623
" When they get the goal in , such a game can tilt , " Büring knows from years of experience .	-7.3698
After all , the USC , with its sophisticated forces , made everything clear and set the goal of full yield .	-5.6192
" We all know who is on the other side of a Derby .	-3.9887
That is not breaking our grasp .	-3.3354
I saw really good volleyball in stages " , Annacker did not hate the 0 : 3 - and went straight to the agenda .	-6.2910
It seems impossible to predict where the Independent will go after just three days of playing .	-5.2335
" It is simply too early for this , " says Axel Büring .	-3.4890
Only in one he feels confirmed : " The 3rd League has an incredibly good level .	-4.1119
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball " , but they don 't want to look down to the fourth league anyway .	-7.2672
If the West is not grubbed up in the coming weeks , they will have to look up . .	-7.1897
However , an initial balance sheet can only be drawn up after ten or eleven matches .	-3.8977
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim .	-3.0493
Aasee will be in Essen on 14 October .	-3.4497
Djuricin Out : That is how the network reacts .	-2.7891

The best reactions on the net .	-1.7214
In the social media , of course , there was also discussion about the Djuricin Out .	-5.7802
While many fans on Twitter were relieved , others thanked the coach for his commitment despite all the odds .	-4.5190
The fans are of course already thinking about a successor .	-4.4691
While Didi Kühbauer is a favorite , some fans prove humour .	-3.3892
Trendsport provides a record for visitors in Braunschweig at the weekend .	-3.9643
The city centre on Saturday is quite rare .	-4.2575
On Sunday there are only a few remaining places in the city 's car parks .	-4.3977
The city marketing reports a visitor record .	-2.4676
The Trendsport-Weekend did the best advertising for the shopping city of Braunschweig .	-3.6906
A significant part of this was a highly attractive framework programme .	-3.2546
Trendsport weekend , so far it has been said that BMXers and skateboarders get their money 's worth .	-5.0911

The car park next to the highway 52 , which is normally used for shuttle traffic to the fair , was largely empty , other people were not injured during the crash .	-4.5657
Emergency care providers continued to support flight students and eyewitnesses on site .	-4.9028
In the immediate vicinity was the venue for an Oktoberfest , where many guests were expected in the evening .	-4.9119
The crash was initially unclear - the weather was good , there was light wind and sunshine .	-3.0957
Essen-Mülheim is a small airport which is used by pilots with light private planes .	-4.1920
Her marriage to Hans von Borsody : Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband .	-1.5515
On the " Dream Ship " Heide Keller became a star .	-2.7007
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series might have been complicit in her marriage with Hans von Borsody .	-5.3374
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the " Dream Ship " made Heide Keller ( 76 ) famous , but on January 1 , 2018 she went off for ever .	-4.5784
The series that made her star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody ( 1929 - 2013 ) , with whom she was married for ten years .	-3.7933
" This could also have been a reason .	-2.6515
Because I was grown up with this work , travelled with a suitcase alone around the world and many colleagues I admired saw me on equal terms " , tells Keller in conversation with the " picture on Sunday " .	-5.4711
First she had always been " the wife of Hans von Borsody " , but that changed with the " dream ship " .	-3.8270
For now , the journalists only shouted at Heide Keller .	-3.6638
" I do not know whether he liked it so well " .	-3.6497
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been envious , but " like many men , Hans was afraid to talk about problems and feelings " .	-5.7491
Keller always tried to be " the only right person for Hans von Borsody " and he wanted to know my fears , my weaknesses .	-4.9319
In other words , in plain English : I have withstood ' , as she says .	-6.5600
She always felt " not good enough for him .	-2.6610
He saw in me an emancipated woman , which in reality I never was , even though I sometimes appeared naughty and courageous on the stage .	-5.1055
I wanted our love to be forever " .	-1.6405
After a marriage to Thomas Härtner that had already failed before , Keller said yes again , " although I was afraid that it could go wrong again " .	-5.0547
The day before the civil ceremony , I sat in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything .	-4.6351
In 2372 , he was assigned to the USS Enterprise-D .	-9.4292
Why it never worked with men ?	-2.1704
Because I wanted too much .	-0.8928
Keller presented his love at the time " as in the film .	-4.7695
Unfortunately , this vision is not suitable for everyday use .	-2.5480
I have approached love far too naively " .	-3.3748
The Nightfalter , who regularly explores the nightlife of the city at the NZZ resort of Zurich , has dared the ZFF-Opening Party this time .	-5.7813
Our fold is not a moth , but a little light shy .	-4.1324
And the glow in which a green carpet is dug on the Sechseläutenplatz is dazzling it too much .	-8.2347
But it 's a film festival , more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight .	-5.4274
So on this late Thursday night he torches over the square to make himself easy in the " Aquaclean-WC Oasis " .	-5.7741
This is the name of the public toilet facility , sponsored by a large sanitary company , which is celebrating its premiere at the festival . The needful establishment on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a great effort to create a luxurious ambience .	-9.8317
This evening , however , the men ’ s oasis stinks to the sky for some reason .	-5.0878
So get out here , go over the other side of the street : Geladene guests who have just had the best level of entertainment in the cinema next door to the opening film " Green Book " celebrate as every year the festival spirit with a party in the three-storey department store .	-9.9957
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival : as you know , the shown works come from all over the world .	-5.3316
What do you not need to think about an article about this festival in order not to fall into secret advertising for its 190 partner companies ?	-6.3186
The Falter binds himself a tie around the Fühler , which has given him a good fairy , and two bully doorstewards actually fill him generously .	-9.1344
Inside , the geladens push themselves , dance far after midnight to live music , or let DJ beat each other ’ s rhythms , and rinse down exquisite appetizers with Cüpli .	-7.9556
At the delicatessenladen in the souterrain , oysters are waiting for sizzling mouths , next to the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut , a chocolate fountain is bubbling .	-7.9154
And the hammer is : all the shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion .	-4.2035
This has been the case for years , so it seems to work without great losses .	-3.9358
You have to love this country for it !	-3.0110
The folds study the sign at the escalator : " Wear a long dress , please be careful on the escalator " .	-5.6490
If the two are separate instructions , he has lost himself in the dress code .	-5.7952
But it is more a conditional construction , and it has certainly saved lives .	-3.6547
In the houseware-department on the upper floor the poultry dumps a cocktail prepared with espresso called " Golden Eye " , in accordance with the festival award .	-5.6226
This mix , with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself , does not necessarily get the price for the best drink .	-4.9910
And George Clooney , who has been campaigning for that brand for years , is not here the evening either .	-3.5667
However , between local celebrities , cash desks and kitchen articles , a face that is known to the observer is passing : Peter Farrell , director of the opening film .	-9.2922
His main character should not be far away .	-4.2613
And really : Right now Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd with soon sixty acting almost like a choral boy .	-5.8118
It is not being squabbled , it is not being paid for , it is at best being stealthed .	-7.7011
It is precisely for this reticence that international stars love this film festival , often misunderstood .	-4.6533
Maradona celebrates Mexico ’ s Victory with Cumbia Dances	-3.6535
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team .	-2.9877
Argentina ’ s football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico .	-3.0964
After a 2 : 0 victory by his club Dorados de Sinaloa , the 57 year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen , as shown in a video already published on Saturday .	-4.6065
In the 15-second clip of a team member , Maradona dances in the yellow jersey , fired by the players .	-4.1827
The Mexican second league had defeated Leones Negros by 2 : 0 on Saturday .	-4.5001
After the game called Maradona in a TV camera " Always with my guys , always " .	-2.3359
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since early September .	-2.0261
Handball : League of Associations 1 : ASV Sending to last-minute default " Destroyed on the ground "	-5.5472
Swen Biedeki , Coach of the Handball Association Association ASV Senden , could hardly believe : " Such a bitter defeat " .	-6.4045
As in Steinhagen , as against Hüllhorst , they had not played badly over long periods , the broadcasters .	-4.8020
Only the initial phase " we have totally sleeped " , the ASV trainer got annoyed .	-6.1628
The owners of the house quickly ran at 8 : 1 , even the early days that Bienahki had taken did not bear fruit at first .	-8.4735
" But then suddenly a ruck went through the team " , Bieveki summarized the second quarter of an hour .	-5.7774
At the break , the delay was only two goals .	-3.7489
Especially Senders Bester , Marius Hintz , met at the stage one by one .	-5.5734
After the change it became even better from a visitor ’ s point of view .	-7.3972
After 33 minutes David Ernst compared to 15 : 15 , after which the baton changer almost ran throughout .	-6.2356
Four minutes before the siren , the lead was still seemingly reassuring three matches ( 29 : 26 ) .	-2.8501
And then ?	-1.0054
Griff the non-partisan into the event .	-5.5403
Biegeleki is usually wary of blaming others .	-6.1649
But : The 120-second penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received was " a joke . "	-4.6546
LIT had a good laugh and met four times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack .	-5.0778
The boys fought great , stood up against seven men at the back , and repeatedly thrown on the empty goal .	-7.4316
But they can buy little for the compliments .	-2.7085
" Now it has to be a damned victory " , says the completely operated Biedeki .	-6.6841
ASV Doors : Hintz ( 9 ) , Ernst ( 6 ) , Schlögl ( 4 ) , Kretschmer ( 3 ) , Kümper ( 2 ) , Mühlhoff ( 2 ) , van de Pol ( 2 ) .	-1.8914

Bavaria : Missing women for 30 years - Police digging corpses	-3.7210
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila ( district court ) , the police are looking for the mortal remains of the woman .	-4.1747
On Saturday , forces set up a road at Marxgrün .	-4.5515
The road surface and several layers of it were removed , as the police and the public prosecutor jointly announced .	-7.3417
According to new evidence , the missing person may have been buried not far from their place of residence .	-4.5376
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986 .	-1.6911
The investigators did not rule out a crime .	-2.6176
Since last year , the criminal police court , together with the public prosecutor 's office , has , according to the data , been working intensively on the case .	-5.3934
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian monument protection authority , the investigators found a conspicuous presence under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar .	-6.4882
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones , the officials confined the place to a few metres .	-5.4779
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon .	-2.6183
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the net .	-3.4425
However , users themselves can also provide additional security .	-2.3474
Instead of complicated character sequences , users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net .	-3.6434
In addition , security updates , such as for Windows , should be installed quickly , nor does it harm equipping computers with anti-virus protection .	-5.0056
Elon Musk , founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla , has escaped his threatened dismissal as head of the billionaire company .	-4.2114
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) brought a non-judicial lawsuit on misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies .	-5.1829
As part of the comparison , Musk and Tesla pay $ 20 million each , and Musk also relinquishes the office of Chairman for three years , a position comparable to that of the German chairman of the supervisory board .	-5.4075
He may remain on the board .	-4.9260
Neither Musk nor Tesla accepted misconduct in the comparison that has yet to be confirmed by a court .	-4.5076
The SEC had sued the world ’ s famous manager at the US federal court in Manhattan for fraud .	-5.0518

Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section .	-4.2835
And opportunities .	-0.6785
But Frerichs before his death ( 17 ) , who switched in Luca Rehberg ( 26 ) and Jan Schroer ( 38 ) missed the lead .	-3.9366

After the break , the VfL took full control .	-7.9155
Thewes from 18 meters failed .	-4.2741

" The companies will have to set up differently , otherwise the international competitors will pass by them , " said Stiftungs-Geschäftsführer Wiebke Ankersen .	-4.9492
In the US , the United Kingdom , or Sweden , purely male leadership teams are far from conceivable , with few exceptions .	-5.2321
The backwardness makes German competitors less diverse , innovation-friendly and future-oriented .	-4.5159
It is a different corporate culture .	-1.4362

According to Allbright , only 6.8 % of the boards are female .	-3.0614
In the previous year , however , the figure was still 3.8 % .	-3.1911
In the 30 DAX companies , which have been pioneers in recent years , the proportion of women has stagnated .	-4.5259

From 10 o ’ clock onwards , the ramparts were opened in front of the entrance to the church .	-7.0130
At first the biker ’ s spring was on the program and it was possible to strengthen itself with coffee and cake or even with a good currywurst .	-7.2901
In addition to the MoGo team , the Holy Riders , a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach , were also present .	-3.4700
The sermon was held during the Biker worship of parish priest Dirk Grzegorek .	-3.8702
The singer songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical underscore .	-4.2385
" Although the bikers prefer the blues rock , Valerie Lill is rather poetic and quiet , " says pastor Frank Schröder .	-5.7258
This , too , was certainly a novelty in the history of the service of the Godfather .	-5.2949
Fechthorfer ’ s Homeland Society Celebrates Great Feast : After the apple comes the milk	-5.6200
And Borisch was also active at the actual day of action .	-3.3531
She served her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes .	-3.4327
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest .	-2.3576
He had his apple press in his luggage and showed his amazed audience step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice .	-4.9262
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnel .	-3.7806
With a little muscle power , the apples became a finely chopped mass .	-3.3102
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it would become a tasty drink .	-4.6879
But they were also able to look at this important step forward this late Friday afternoon .	-4.5259
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets , Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces , layer by layer , that look a bit like haggle .	-10.2811
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support , the last step was not so difficult .	-4.8009
The freshly pressed juice ran gradually into a large vessel .	-2.9100
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had ready-made specialities .	-5.2230
So he opened his " treasure box " and presented the newest feather white to the older visitors .	-4.0856
The demand for the good drop " Made in Füchtorf " was correspondingly large .	-3.1216
In a cosy atmosphere , the parents spoke , while the children were able to follow not only the process of apple pressing , but also the built castle for themselves .	-6.6997
Also active members of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers were involved in the festival and invited to play for a short time at some stations .	-7.5818
The local association will also offer an action day next year .	-5.0208
But then , as Gregor Krütkamp pointed out , the home house in the heart of the Savings Board will not be the place of events .	-4.9341
Instead , a farm will be visited .	-1.3418
This is obvious because of the subject : after all , it will be all about milk .	-5.3588
1 : 4 gegen Frankfurt : Hannover mit vierter Saison-Pleite : " Geissene Situation " .	-4.1527
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat , coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 and gave them courage .	-4.9385
However , there were not many positive things to see at the 1 : 4 ( 0 : 2 ) last table at Eintracht Frankfurt .	-5.9454
" It is a cunning situation , but you have to face up to it as a team , " said 96 football professor Pirmin Schwegler , and said : " This is of course disappointing , because you always think a lot about it " .	-8.5581
The more triumphant Lower Saxony , for which only Florent Muslija ( 86th ) met to join , are at the very bottom with two meters and are a candidate for the podium in their current constitution .	-7.7553
On the other hand , guided by the outstanding Ante Reć , Frankfurt celebrated the first season home victory .	-5.9683
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute , Rebić ( 45th + 1 ) , Jonathan de Guzmán ( 59th ) and Luka Jovic ( 89th ) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators who , after the successful general rehearfor the European against Lazio in Rome with seven .	-6.1680
Croatia ’ s Vice-World Champion Rebić was involved in almost every dangerous offensive by the Hessen during his starter debut and never got under control by Hannovers ’ defenses .	-8.2819
The storm , long after the World Cup , showed with its speed and assertiveness why it is so valuable for harmony .	-4.4924
In addition to Rekic , the Brazilian , borrowed by FC Liverpool , Allan was the first time in the early formation of Frankfurt , which started in a lively manner .	-8.9338
A football from Lucas Torró ( 17 ) , twisted to the net , brought danger for the first time .	-6.9449
Six minutes later , in a promising position , Sébastien Haller was stopped at the last moment by the 96 defence against the Brazilian Felipe , who replaced the short term Kevin Wimmer ( back ) .	-4.8881
Leadership for homeowners fell almost inevitably and fully deserved .	-4.0104
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defensive corner in the penalty room , Haller extended per head in front of the goal , where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot .	-5.5539
It was the first Bundesliga player for the French second league player AJ Auxerre , who came in the summer .	-12.5688
And Frankfurt did so before the break .	-3.2531
This time Haller was passing on to his storm partner Rebic , who skilfully sank through and didn 't give Michael Esser a chance .	-9.0950
In the half-time , Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak vision of his elf , bringing two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt .	-5.3386
The Niedersachsen played a bit bolder forward , but ignominious ideas remained out until just before the end , when the next meeting was still successful .	-7.3875
The Hessen were much more efficient .	-2.3621
After less than an hour , Reć started a solo and then set off on De Guzmán , who only had to push the ball into the empty goal .	-6.1055
The rest was only a show run for the Frankfurt public against overcrowded guests , even Jovic met one minute before the end .	-6.9535
Morlaix Square becomes a party .	-4.2867

Violin : Violin Christians Celebrate Holy Cross Festival	-4.4917
The vulsing Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on 14 September or on Sunday after .	-5.4377
The ceremonial service takes place in the city church , followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with its final blessing .	-5.5974
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ from the Thirty Years War on which , according to legend , a Swedish soldier was shot .	-5.2148
Blood then flowed from the rubble .	-6.9008
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ , which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church .	-5.1304
This is still not finished , only the altarpiece stands , the missing longhouse is hinted by the trees .	-6.4950
In his sermon , parish priest Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope , comfort and life .	-3.2917
The religious service was poorly attended despite the importance for the violin parish .	-5.1003
After the divine service , the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing ended the church part of the Cross .	-5.9019
For many years now , the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish home .	-7.1306
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food and a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted , farm ice .	-7.7825
In the afternoon , the parish offered guided tours around the town church . On behalf of the parish , Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors about the damage to the facade , roof , sandstone works and windows as well as the planned construction work which will continue until next year .	-6.2931
Since the framework has already been in place for some time , the damage has been more accurately identified and the individual calls for proposals have been prepared more specifically .	-6.3124
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned , because the damage that already existed a few years ago has increased , but there has also been more evidence of what was only made possible by the use of scaffolding .	-7.7238
The plaster work has been completed , the natural stone work is to be started before the winter and it is hoped to be possible to complete half of this work this year .	-7.6181
Inauguration : New residential home in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße	-7.8137
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for disabled people in Münsterblickstraße .	-4.3692
The fact that " a very special house " will now be handed over to its purpose in the Münsterblickstraße - there was agreement among all those present at the inauguration date .	-7.5491
After all , the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the living quarters of the life aid Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building .	-5.3536
In his concept , architect Rudolf Bader took into account broader corridors , corridors and doors , larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas .	-5.2634
The first plans began about eight years ago , when the former US Army officer building was put to the test for the residents of Handicap : " The house had come into the years and had not been equipped with modern equipment , " Bader retrospectively said .	-7.9649
In 2016 , the excavators went to demolish the house .	-3.2278
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel at home , according to the architect .	-5.0078
Help Donau-Iller Open New Home	-4.1335
About 4.6 million euros were invested in living aid in the new building .	-4.3550
The Free State increased EUR 2.4 million , the district of Swabia EUR 450000 .	-4.7493
According to architect Bader , the construction works remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money .	-4.2327
The Managing Director of Lebenshilfe , Jürgen Heinz , thanked him for this too . .	-6.2805
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy .	-4.1730
Nevertheless , the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help .	-6.8371
Similarly , Gertrud Kreutmayer , Head of Social Administration of the district of Swabia , said : " The house is geared to the special needs of its residents , who need tools to be mobile " .	-5.6556
The living space and functionality were well combined , Kreutmayer said .	-4.0275
And again : " The plot in this situation is a real stroke of luck , because it is no longer possible to buy it in the current situation " .	-6.8557
Altogether , the new residential home in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities , spread over three residential groups , on almost 1500 square metres .	-6.7984
Heinz , Managing Director of Life Aid , is proud of the eleven full-time employees , all of whom are employed by Fare .	-8.2100
Germany : Sweden laments differences between East and West	-1.8554
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity , the Deputy Federal Chairman of the SPD , Manuela Schwesig , appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germany .	-7.0071
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity .	-3.0138
We must not be satisfied with these differences , " said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to the " Sunday mirror " .	-3.9873
The objective must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country .	-2.8524
It is unacceptable that East Germany , on average , worked longer than the people of West Germany , but received 15 % less pay .	-3.9721
" I cannot explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity , " said Schwesig .	-3.3997
North Korea : Does this clean dog stop the Korean conflict ?	-2.6656
The one-year old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas .	-3.7394
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul , Pyongyang gave a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs .	-3.5252
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday , the two dogs , about one year old , reached their recipient on Thursday .	-5.0496
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to " facilitate the weaning of animals " .	-5.6182
The dogs with the thick white coat , sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent .	-2.8404
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .	-1.8914
The North announced the friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang in mid-September .	-3.3200
Both countries also agreed to join forces in international sports competitions , such as the 2020 Olympic Games , and to apply jointly for the Olympic Games to be held in 2032 .	-5.0427
In the process of rapprochement , Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile engines .	-4.5398
Austria ’ s Moved History in the Mirror of 99 Documents	-1.9294
What is Austria ?	-0.4015
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic , which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year , a number of new books have been published , which mostly answer this question in retrospect over the past hundred years .	-6.2340
Wolfgang Maderthaner , historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives , writes it quite differently in the magnificent " Bilderbuch " Austria , which will be released on October 1 .	-5.8338
New Week , New Chance for the Government	-1.4865
Back to the substantive work , that is the unofficial motto of the Great Coalition working week that begins today .	-4.8645
Hardly an interview , hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU , the SPD and also from the CSU did not last mention the ' return to the work of the substance ' in mantra-like terms .	-6.7023
This may have led some artisans , doctors , cashiers and other working citizens in that country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and work , but be it .	-6.1901
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its task of governing , it should not be deterred by conceptual debates .	-5.5190
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blasts of recent weeks may already be clear on Monday .	-6.0281
In the evening , the leaders of the governing parties meet in the coalition committee .	-6.2992
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflict early , a lesson of all the dispute .	-3.9751
First of all , however , diesel retrofits and the law on skilled migration once again raise conflicting issues .	-7.1879
The CSU Transport Minister , Mr Scheuer , wants to let car companies get away with exchange premiums , while the SPD and the CDU see manufacturers as being obliged to retrofit older diesel .	-9.1612
While the diesel crisis has marked a rapprochement over the weekend , the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned law on skilled migration .	-6.3145
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training .	-5.2056
The Union is strongly opposed to the ' change of track ' from the asylum system to the labour market .	-3.5622
So there will be another dispute among coalition partners - and how else ?	-3.5391
It was not the same thing that joined the GroKo together , but three partners with sometimes very different social views and priorities .	-6.9048
Dispute is good .	-2.2908
Without dispute , a society characterised by such diverse , sometimes conflicting interests is not making progress .	-5.3788
In order to be constructive , however , disputes must not again be fuelled for party-tactical reasons on the question of being or not .	-6.2943
This is still about politics , not about theatre .	-2.8186
The Union and the SPD should argue - but always have a view on the reality of people 's lives .	-5.6550
What is feasible and beneficial to many ?	-2.1486
With this key issue , both the diesel and track change issues can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence .	-5.6899
That is what the popular parties must now fight for .	-4.1165
Pilz Checks Working Hours at Hartinger	-2.1044
Minister in Target	-2.4402
Is it the Minister of Labour who is violating the law of service ?	-4.7287
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this .	-2.1373
" Really day and night " their legislators would have worked on social security reform , reported an exuberant social minister when she presented it two weeks ago .	-6.1668
The statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein ( FPÖ ) by Daniela Holzinger , a member of the list mushroom mandate , is met with astonishment - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via a question .	-7.3803
She assumes that ' the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and that she did not wish to declare any violations of the law of service in front of cameras running ' .	-9.1086
Nevertheless , they now have questions in order to " acquit Har ­ tinger of any suspicion " .	-4.7112
Police Breaks a Street in Search of Women ’ s Like	-6.8129
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to speak .	-3.3930
Now we have confirmation .	-1.7910
Since early Saturday morning , the road between Naila and Bad Steben has been excavated .	-4.5610
The route is closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday .	-3.2462
It was assumed that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog .	-5.6340
The dog , specially trained for the smell of old human bones , together with his guide , was able to limit the relevant position to a few meters .	-6.3475
In addition , a soil anomalie has been discovered in the area of the said road site , together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian National Heritage Authority .	-7.8825
For more than a year already the Public Prosecutor and Criminal Police Court have been processing the missing case .	-4.5667
A cycle path was repeatedly blocked by Marxgrün and examined with sonars because investigators suspect that Heike 's body could have been buried here 30 years ago as part of the construction of the state road .	-8.3184
Colour powder and eggs : Crawls in Barcelona before Catalonia ’ s anniversary	-4.1142
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia .	-2.7138
But there have been riots before .	-3.9766
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017 .	-2.5074
Barcelona – Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1 , 2017 , clashes between separatists and the police occurred in the center of Barcelona .	-4.0133
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence campaigners with , among other things , colour powder to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the civil guard .	-5.5033
Some 3 000 police officers from the National Police and Guardia Civil Police units wanted to use a demonstration to honour their colleagues who were in service last year during the illegal referendum in the polling stations .	-8.1879
There was also violence at that time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting .	-4.5951
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the separatist demonstrations and the central state security forces separate , reported Spanish media .	-4.5031
Some of the 6000 separatists , however , would then have violently tried to break the police chain , using , among other things , beatings and eggs for officials .	-6.8986
Six people have been arrested and 24 others have been slightly injured under appeal to the authorities .	-4.4637
Monday marks the first anniversary of the referendum on independence .	-2.1637
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain , the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under forced management in the autumn of 2017 .	-4.5357
The then regional president , Carles Puigdemont , fled to Belgium .	-2.3035
Other politicians , too , turned to foreign countries .	-4.4382
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement , on the other hand , remain in U-prison .	-4.5326
In December , new elections were held in the region .	-2.0662
After the new Catalan government took office in May , the administration was terminated .	-3.9468
But the new regional president , Quim Torra , also insists on the " right to self-determination " of Catalans .	-3.0115
Football : Oberliga Westfalen : Unsettled Rattlelessness : FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen disco.	-5.5244
Red and white Ahlen continues on the spot .	-3.4686
Even the FC Gütersloh had only a 0 : 0 draw .	-4.9310
The rear lights and the third last one appeared to 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as a total helplessness .	-8.4018
The first half was overseen by the entertainment factor .	-3.5606
So if you wanted to get a beer or a sausage , you could do it safely .	-6.8677
There was no risk of missing a torchance , because there was virtually none .	-4.1176
Half an Hour First Shot	-2.2815
Nick Flock was responsible for the first ( harmless ) shot of the entire match in the 28th minute .	-10.0569
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility was the Ahlener , when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westerkerling forced him into a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the prison line .	-6.7384
The hosts were even more harmless .	-2.0773
Their most effective action was an early change .	-2.7719
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced for reasons of injury , and Sinan Aygün came for him .	-4.2193
After the change , both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom .	-3.4676
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel was aiming just over the housing from 18 meters and after an hour the freight car also appeared on the offensive for the first time .	-7.7016
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz it went fix .	-3.8498
" Nick Flock ( 62 . ) " crowned the quickly performed Konter over Sinan Aygün with a gentle shot into the arms of RWA orwart Bernd Schipmann .	-6.9496
They also played Wieckowicz 's ( 66th ) headball after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein .	-6.2684
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut reacted , first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy ( 60 ) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel ( 70 ) .	-3.4945
It did nothing .	-2.2716
The Ahlener did not achieve anything more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative .	-3.9016
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance , but neither did it .	-4.5364
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive : ' I like the fact that we played to zero ' , but unfortunately the zero was also in the front .	-6.4219
" We were not as dangerous this time as we were against Woodwindede and that although our opponent did not want to play here , " said RW Ahlen 's interim coach .	-5.9592
Offensive , " everything so a bit " pleaded against a team that only wanted to defend .	-5.4559
In any case , I did not feel that we could get the opposite , " says Daut .	-4.7057
As a spectator , however , one did not feel that his team could score a goal .	-5.4972
The idea was too meagre . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-8.0808
Reckenfeld ’ s Harvest Market : Fortunately , there are enough of them .	-5.2539
Brigitte Ransmann , Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tabelausgabstelle , for whom these donations are intended .	-3.9391
The official assurances : " These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld " .	-4.6762
At the opening the sky was shining blue , while the square was still somewhat empty , but that should change over the course of the day .	-5.7153
For : " Here it is so nice sociable , so we are here today " , said a visitor .	-4.9878
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holtür welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a real sense of humour .	-6.0896
For Brockmann , who was supposed to be weighed up against food , Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer quickly jumped in .	-4.0574
Verena ( daughter of Ferdi Kreimer ) has become ill .	-1.9640
But there are enough of them .	-2.7338
And the " replacement " could not be taken to entertain the increasing number of visitors .	-6.4575
It was so good that some folk songs were sung at the late hour .	-4.5385
" Just great " , Marcel Kreimer was delighted .	-2.5694
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date on his schedule this time .	-4.0398
He is happy about the many active people with their stands , mostly clubs .	-5.1748
" Actually there should not be anything like a table , " he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir .	-5.9765
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivities and the Clean Up campaign which took place in September .	-6.4977
Our garden town has a colourful coat of paint - here is what is going on .	-5.9316
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück ’ s Maikrat was taken to the Winterquartier with the help of the fire brigade .	-5.4788
Many stands were worked for the physical well-being .	-4.1487
From sweet to hearty detention everything was to be had .	-7.3539
Stefan Hagemeyer , who has been living in Reckenfeld for only one year , has been creative on his decupier saw .	-4.7451
He offered veneer work , beer lid with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more .	-6.0648
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a specialty : " Reckenfelder Honey " , accompanied by Maria-Theresia Smolka , Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter .	-10.5927
The latter has a specialty .	-2.7950
Honey cake in glass , of course with honey from my own production .	-2.3800
There the little Elsa had to access again and again , so tasted the cake .	-3.9319
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to stay long into the evening hours , even without a stage programme that does not exist at the autumn festival .	-6.4458
Blacksmithing with a local political message : no successful advertising of skate plants .	-4.9909
In Len , unknowns have hardly promoted the prospect of building a skate facility in a meaningful . . were . were . were . . were ,	-10.1639
In several places there are corresponding blacksmiths , says Jürgen Kohne of the City Council at the request of the WN .	-7.2255
In at least one case , criminal charges have been brought against the police for damage .	-3.7350
In large letters , the three words " Skatepark for Len " are used on signs at the Gemmpt-Halle and the Old Town Hall .	-7.2096
Michael Rottmann , manager of the hall , reports that a corresponding inscription on the advertising sign on the stairway to the Gemmpt-Bistro had already been discovered after the trade fair on 19 September .	-6.1014
Since the short message was apparently left " only " with an Edding at the time , it could easily be removed .	-5.1937
" A few days later this was back , this time sprayed on " , says Rottmann .	-5.5621
He assumes that the appropriate advertising shield must be replaced .	-4.6099
A special feature of this particular case is the fact that several large companies are also mentioned on the board .	-7.4111
If the skate system is built , it will also be possible to realize it by sponsors .	-5.2723
Commitments have already been made , explains Jörg Hesselmann of the urban field of education , sport and culture , without mentioning names .	-6.0638
It is possible , however , that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those listed on the awarded board .	-5.4948
For years local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skateboarding .	-4.5501
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic , the search for an alternative location began after some time .	-4.9541
After all , the majority of the Council was in favour of the fire-fighting car park .	-4.3865
However , this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently opposed construction at this point .	-5.2975
At the end of June , a U-turn followed .	-2.3272
The members of the main and financial committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School .	-3.9461
As for the state of affairs , Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the midst of concrete planning .	-4.2738
The City Council then has the last word .	-3.0013
It is based on a decision this year , so that a positive vote in 2019 could be taken .	-3.8780
The Air Traffic Impass Making Worse	-5.8535
Frankfurt / Hamburg Following the European air traffic chaos in the summer , German air traffic controllers see no sign of improvement next year .	-3.3197
" This year we had wind , in 2019 we will have a strong wind and then the storm comes , " said Matthias Maas , the head of the aviation union , the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October .	-5.2906
An important reason for the many delays and flight losses was the long-known staffing shortage of European air traffic control systems , for which there is no quick solution .	-10.3856
" Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year , but the training of new pilots takes four to five years , " said the trade unionist . .	-11.9094
Across Europe , the market is empty for fully trained pilots .	-5.1587
About a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace .	-4.0844
Maas once again criticised the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit .	-2.6181
On Friday , representatives of the federal government , countries , air traffic control , airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic City to address the causes of delays .	-4.8207
" If we want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime , we will not do that without us , " explained the head of the GdF , which has many members at the German Federal Air Traffic Control .	-7.3225
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for pilotage .	-4.4406
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low .	-3.2488
The resulting cost specifications and personnel savings in the national air traffic control systems are now fully in line with the operational business .	-6.6789
Maas called on Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer ( CSU ) to work in Brussels for regulations that do not " cut off the air even further " .	-6.1863
At present , the EU ’ s requirements would be agreed by 2024 and there is a fear of further tightening .	-6.0697
The EU is under constant pressure from the airlines .	-2.2684
" Ryan CEO Michael O 'Leary and his colleagues are now harvesting exactly what they have sown in recent years , " said Maas .	-4.2162
He hopes that the high cost of airline delays will lead to a rethink .	-4.9010
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if the German Air Safety Authority ( DFS ) provides a " coherent training and future pact " , said Maas .	-4.9012
The previously announced annual intake of 120 pilots over the next five years was just sufficient to compensate for the age-related departures .	-6.7626
The necessary staff building is not yet connected with this .	-4.3924

Barcelona : Violence in demonstrations by police and Catalan supporters of independence .	-3.6479
In two parallel demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan advocates of independence in Barcelona , there were violent clashes with many injured .	-4.7484
According to the city administration , some 3000 police from all over Spain gathered on Saturday , as well as some 6000 pro-independence demonstrators .	-6.2712
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests out of hand with a large crowd .	-5.1969

Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues	-2.1575
The police had wanted to pay tribute to those colleagues who fought almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia , banned by the Spanish central government .	-5.0509
At the same time , they demanded better salaries .	-1.8138
Members of the Spanish police force and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve far more than they deserve .	-4.0446
The demonstrators saw it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona , of all places .	-4.1591
" Why did they come here to protest ? " asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency .	-3.1059
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago .	-2.7663
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands , who only wanted to give his name to Daniel , dismissed the charge .	-4.3910
" Of course we want to support our comrades who last year did only their duty : to defend the law , " he said .	-3.5348
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona , because it is a great European city and there is more echo here .	-4.1024
However , he and his colleagues ' did not come to provoke ' , the policeman assured us .	-3.8814

The Portuguese star player " played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia " , praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3 : 1 ( 1 : 1 ) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples .	-4.5746
For the trainer , the expensive Star , even without his own goal , was the decisive man in the important match against the tracker .	-6.0207
" Ronaldo had a lot of fun and makes it good , " said Allegri .	-3.0043
Although we started with tactical mistakes , Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew .	-4.4777
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo , Juve turned the game after the early lag due to the hit of Dries Mertens ( 10th minute ) and temporarily suspended the worst runner .	-7.3907
Real Madrid ’ s goalkeeper , Mario Mandzukic , the former Bundesliga professional , first set the ball in a double pack ( 26 / 49 ) .	-8.2914
Ronaldo also did the groundwork for the defence chief Leonardo Bonucci ( 76 . ) , after a corner of a headball , who only had to push in shortly before the goal line .	-9.9090
" He gives many templates , " the coach praised .	-2.4627
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker , who is both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team of record contactors .	-4.6317
" We need to be even better at serving him , " the coach said .	-3.4110
Best Juve Orguard is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account .	-4.0009
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros , the excess power of Juventus seems to be even more overwhelming .	-3.9184
Seven wins in seven games , the impeccable series in the series A. At 21 points , the master of the last seven years already has six counters ahead of Naples .	-6.3142
The second table , trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti , was not without chance against Turin .	-4.1668
But at the latest after the placement of the already undeclared Mario Rui ( 58 ) the top part was decided .	-6.0742

Kanye West Change Its Name	-2.0750
Rapper Kanye West has made a particularly bizarre appearance at the US TV show " Saturday Night Live " at the weekend .	-5.1970
Among other things , his joint performance with Lil Pump in a Mineralwasser costume caused eyebrows and question marks among the spectators .	-6.2850
In addition , the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album .	-3.0280
From now on , let him only be called " Yes " , according to the musician .	-5.1223

Enough !	-3.3156

That was a poor game of ours today .	-3.3028
The adversary was simply more griffy , we almost never faced problems " .	-6.6358
Two goals chances in 90 minutes , which rarely makes playing positive .	-7.7122
Football club A1 : SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0 : 2 ( 0 : 1 ) photo : Heinz Schwackenberg .	-2.9762
The SG also had only two options in the first round , but the first one was Maik Krause from pointed angle to early guidance ( 7th ) .	-6.1994
Steffen Uphus could have raised in the 43rd minute , but after a great preliminary work from Krause he was left standing .	-6.8791
The hosts had only a double opportunity when Moritz Höne first failed at Torsteiger Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper .	-6.8116
After the break , guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities .	-3.0816
But Uphus ( 49 ) , Julian Turl ( 61 , ) and Heinz Linnemann ( 69 . ) all gave up .	-2.9593
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the gate line and saw red for it - was also unable to use Niklas Eilmann for the guests ( 75 . ) .	-5.5403
It was only when Nils Berheide shot the ball over the line that the match was decided ( 81 . ) .	-3.8905
" We had been severely critical of ourselves before , which was different today than in the last few weeks , " said Florian Kraus .	-6.4641

Football : Circular League A2 Münster : Spectacle Football in Albachten : GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3 : 4 .	-4.6330
" I don 't know what to think of it , " he rang for words .	-3.5704
" We didn 't get access to them at all , " he was supposed to mean the wingspan with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger , but also all the other Green whites that met with a collective offensive urge .	-7.4520
However , he was able to laugh : " A dirty victory , " he still said , cheeky and drew from dann His players , however , was relieved to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points .	-9.1479
Mind you , after a duel of two teams , one of which , Albachten , plays for the championship and the other , Albersloh , fights for the preservation of the class .	-4.8909
With understandably mixed feelings , GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back to the 90 minutes behind him .	-2.4080
" That was by far our best season performance , " he says .	-2.7106
" How we come back after 0 : 2 , how we oppose one of the league 's top teams throughout the game time , that was really phenomenal " .	-5.8910
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed .	-4.2069
Top Torjäger Lars Zymner took the host to the lead with his 12th season meeting ( 24 ) .	-5.5030
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal .	-2.7276
The 2 : 0 he placed on the left side in exemplary fashion for Fabian Fröhning ( 39 . ) .	-6.3276
We knew that , but you can 't handle such a player completely .	-5.8355
" That was already madness , what he did , " Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of his opponent without envy .	-6.1213
Shortly before the change of direction , his own elf made the balance : McGill 's freekick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long Toreck ( 45 ) .	-7.2606
After the change of direction , it was McGill who made the balance ( 59 ) .	-6.1178
Then it went back and forth .	-2.7172
It was a tough , action-packed game .	-2.3779
Nübel shocked Albachten again ( 64 ) , only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann ( 69 ) .	-3.6649
In spite of the overwhelming number , Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia match ( 80th ) .	-7.2768
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday .	-2.1763

The mini guitar put her in and also mastered her violin .	-4.0171
Ben Sükrrup sat on the wing .	-3.7435
On the one hand , he is the male sparring partner , who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence , and on the other he is a true pianist : Sürschüp Teubner , so congenially harmonically accompanies Sübner that some may have wished for a solo .	-8.8247
There was also , with Beethoven and Chopin , but differently , as it was to the red thread of the evening .	-5.5894
Teubner had brought into play a paradox : contentment comes with the man when he has a partner but does not open the door .	-5.9860
A closed door without a partner on the other hand is of no use .	-3.5925
The piano solo now demonstrates the same : What would have arisen from Mozart 's composing , had " the Nannerl " opened the door unhoped-for ?	-5.8556
Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations , from Bach 's " O Main full of blood and wounds " into the " Song of Death " , and from Mozart g minor symphony into a playful dance .	-4.4568
There were great applause and ' bravo ' from the full room .	-3.2936

Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the opportunity to make a joint , conciliatory appearance .	-3.1707
" Instead of underlining the Muslim affiliation with Germany side by side with German leaders , Erdogan used the date for his purposes , " he lamented .	-5.1907

From pure fruit to ecology	-2.5562
A gala in Dr.-Stammberger-Halle celebrated the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and national care .	-5.5650
On September 29 , 1893 , a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus set the last foundation impulse for the Kreissverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach , and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle .	-5.5426
In 1893 , he was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa .	-5.4017
The purpose of the fruit growing association also differed from today 's work - in fact , it was only a matter of fruit growing , but at that time no one thought about flowers and gardening .	-8.1860
" At that time , in the age of the Enlightenment , the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites , " explained Kreisheim custodian Günter Dippold in his lecture .	-4.9769
Fruit trees should border roads , so-called industrial gardens have been set up in schools .	-5.1899

The chestnut collection was a huge issue for us children , and I doubt that Smartphone & Co. can be used to gather just as much joy .	-7.6557
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Sölner for the anniversary .	-2.9591
" Where they should stand , the district association decides , " added the district council of Sölner and highlighted the particular importance of the gardening associations for the villages .	-7.3511
The district association stands for ecology , beauty of the garden and green areas in the village .	-3.1245
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt about the fact that district manager and specialist adviser Friedhelm Haun .	-5.5866
He presented the many visitors with an image of the long history of the county council and reported , among other things , the need for self-sufficiency after the war .	-6.7646
In the past everything came out of the garden , for the winter it was given .	-5.0375
At the end of the 1950s , however , the commercial garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden .	-5.1326
" Nature has survived , it was here before us and we must follow it " , the expert argued for fruit and nut trees .	-6.4187
That is why the horticultural associations are being encouraged not to let up so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living .	-6.0440
This includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations , as the President of the Bavarian Land Association , Wolfram Vaitl , added .	-5.0497
" We have to stop the glaring decline in insects , we owe it to our children and grandchildren , " Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony , which was solemnly framed by the Thurnau music club 's towers .	-6.0705

After the " High Energy Rock " of the " Tigers " a synthesizer is also used at " Here We Stand " .	-3.2846

Trump tells Kim : " And then we fell in love . "	-4.2860
It is no secret that North Korea ’ s leader Kim is well disposed to the nuclear crisis .	-8.8283

And then we fell in love .	-0.9241

No , really .	-1.4012
And it is not just talks with Kim that would have melted his heart .	-2.9192
He wrote wonderful letters , great letters .	-2.9492
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit : Trump has pointed to Kim ’ s announcement that all nuclear and missile tests will be halted , even if critics so far see little more than lip service .	-5.9296
The US president seemed to be well aware of the fact that everyone is not likely to be sympathetic to whether his notorious " Rocket Man " ( nicknamed Kim ) is a martial drug .	-10.2003
In any case , he immediately anticipated the expected criticism in his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling : " Donald Trump says they have fallen in love . "	-9.0106
How terrible is that ?	-2.3650
This is so unpresidential .	-2.6598
He did not care much about it , Trump explained , and then turned his finger on the crowd : " I have always told you it is so easy to be presidential . "	-6.8036
But then there would not be 10 000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena , but only 200 people out there .	-5.1790

The two countries ' relations are currently ' overshadowed ' , Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport .	-3.6816
This concerns , above all , waves of arrests , freedom of the press and freedom of religion .	-3.4603

Erdogan continued to travel after the conversation to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne .	-3.5107
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building .	-2.2320

Secretary of State Ri is calling for Washington to cooperate .	-3.6100
North Korea ’ s foreign minister , Ri Yong Ho , has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons in the UN General Debate with its continued sanctions . in .	-8.5657
" The recent deadlock is that the US is relying on coercive measures that are lethal for confidence-building , " said Ri in New York .	-4.3630
Disarmament is unthinkable in these circumstances for North Korea .	-2.0359
" Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security and , in such circumstances , there is no way that we will disarm ourselves as the first to disarm ourselves , " said the North Korean chief diplomat .	-5.1854
The fact that punitive measures could ' bring North Korea to its knees ' is ' a pipe dream of people who do not know us ' . .	-7.8277
In order to build trust , however , his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear testing facility , Ri emphasized .	-4.0765
However , the US side did not respond to this , the minister criticised .	-5.5996
Because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program , the UN Security Council decided on three sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year alone .	-3.8353

We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and we were well prepared for the big day .	-4.5569
But then on the first day after the summer break the bad surprise came : a blackout had put off the huge , two-piece refrigerator , the food was spoilt and had to be disposed of .	-6.5265
" Now we had to start again from scratch : we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours , but the children and young people wanted to do it on their own " , says Westbuer .	-5.1730
And so everyone got along .	-5.0415
The result could be seen , the guests were enthusiastic .	-3.8782

The Stuttgarter had to fight against the Werder Bremen , which was decimated by a yellow red card against Milos Veljkovic even before the break .	-5.5796

In Wolfsburg , Michael Lang did not make a completely successful but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach .	-4.3792

In Macedonia today , some 1.8 million citizens vote on whether their country 's name should be changed in North Macedonia .	-3.7860
A yes vote could resolve the nearly three decades of simmering conflict with Greece ’ s neighbor .	-4.0663
Athens had insisted on a change of name because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any rapprochement between Macedonia and the West .	-4.1043
Voters therefore also decide on future Western integration .	-3.1610

SPD politicians : Johannes Kahr marries his friend	-3.3129
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all , the SPD politician Johannes Kahr married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde .	-3.1829
The two gave their names on Saturday in Hamburg .	-3.7691
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them , Kahr had previously told the " picture " newspaper .	-4.8728
" If we get married , it is right , " he has been with his partner for 25 years .	-5.0630
The 55-year-old Kahr is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD Bundestag group and one of the speakers of the Seeheim district , the conservative SPD wing .	-5.2455
On June 30 , 2017 , in the federal debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals , Kahr had provoked a furious outcry .	-6.6719
For example , he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) of having " stumbled " on the subject .	-4.5369
" That was your Schabowski moment , " he alluded to Günter Schabowski 's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening .	-3.4570
Since October 1 , 2017 , same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals .	-2.2117
Previously , they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001 , but there was no equality with marriage , for example in the case of adoption law .	-3.9557
Garden Day : Cut 400 Meters	-4.1007
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the civic association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy .	-3.7009
About 400 metres of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründner House should be cut .	-4.8212
Supported by the inhabitants , it went to work for about twelve supporters .	-4.2223
" We are doing this in order to reduce costs , " said the chairman of the citizens ' association , Walter Schröer .	-3.9677
And so much has accumulated .	-2.2962
Due to the hot summer we are late this time , but fortunately it is now only a form cut .	-4.8465
For as early as spring , the hedges were already held back .	-7.2908
The breakfast , which is always followed by work , has a long tradition .	-4.8547
" Everyone should stick to their guns , " said Walter Schröer .	-4.5932
World Cup in Rio : Hannes Aigner brings gold to the Canoeing World Cup .	-3.4794
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canoeing World Championship in Rio de Janeiro .	-2.9138
The 29-year-old set a perfect course on Sunday on the Olympic course .	-4.7527
Two years ago he missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of second .	-3.2255
I was well prepared , had enough trips here on the facility and everything was fit today , " said the Olympia Third in London in 2012 .	-6.4952
In the end , he threw away his paddle with joy and raised both arms safely - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal .	-6.2291
After all , he had start number four .	-2.5967
But the six remaining starters could not topple their fable time of 89.69 seconds .	-3.9814
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pawel Eigel .	-3.2866
The police officer Gauling reports this autumn 's first attempt at burglary into a family house .	-5.4714
Fortunately , the perpetrators failed .	-0.9039
The days are getting shorter - that 's what burglars want to take advantage of .	-4.1702
For example , the police inspectorate , Mr Gauting , reported yesterday the first attempt at breaking in this autumn .	-5.8665
It was thanks to the alarm system that it remained at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße .	-5.3077
After all , the perpetrators got off to work on Friday just before 8 p.m.	-6.1111
The burglars knew that the inhabitants were not at home .	-3.1407
The alarm system , however , apparently surprised her so that she could escape without prey .	-8.3794
Hint to the PI Gauting , phone ( 089 ) 8 93 13 30 .	-2.4876
Hertha ’ s Fall : Recovered of reality : Bavaria versus Ajax	-5.3553
The title is unbeatable : the defeat in Berlin is not something the FC Bayern wants to " not let go " .	-7.9930
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for Niko Kovac ’ s term of office .	-3.5452
The first small performance event under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase for the Munich community to a higher industrial level .	-8.0735
" A week ago one had the impression that we are invincible .	-3.0953
Now we got a bit of reality " , Thomas Müller noted after the deserved 0 : 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and asked for a reaction for the Champions League Duel with Ajax Amsterdam .	-5.3891
Anyone who knows us knows that we are really annoyed about this and that we are therefore giving gas to Tuesday .	-4.8406
For the first time in more than a year no own goal has been shot abroad , as at the same time of the low season two mandatory games in series without victory , the Bundesliga table leadership initially lost to Borussia Dortmund .	-7.8851
While the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of Carlo Ancelotti ’ s failure at the end of September 2017 , the record champion must be warned .	-4.2125
The FC Augsburg at 1 : 1 with its running intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners with their playful needle stitching over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days , as the last seemingly overwhelming Bayern are to be cracked .	-10.3798
" Those who know the FC Bayern know that we will not let this happen and we will do everything we can to ensure that we succeed again , " said Kovac .	-5.8783
However , he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city , and merely pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach for the lack of opportunity again .	-9.2642
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless be a positive outcome of his first interim term of office before the national break - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse .	-5.6257
Thus , before this season ’ s second premier performance , Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures at Benfica Lisbon .	-5.2939
After the free day on Sunday , as planned , the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax , which had also won against AEK Athens at 3 : 0 .	-6.5817
" Now we got caught in two games , but we will also make our goals again , " announced national team captain Manuel Neuer .	-5.1837
Just like after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place Joshua Kimmich spoke clear text .	-5.5568
The lawyer appeared in the role of Mahner .	-4.2696
" I do not think that this is all bad luck , we have to work out it again because we do not make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes at the back , " said the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic stadium .	-6.4432
On the seventh day of the previous season the Bayern were already behind Dortmund by five meters , which has now taken the lead again with one point .	-6.4032
And so Kimmich was at least positive with a wink that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end .	-6.1603
" Yes , this is good , " said the national player .	-3.9311
It is good for the league .	-3.1823
DFB-Boss in Shot Line : Özil-Causa : Sharp Attack by Erdogan to Grindel	-4.2800
The Turkish President , Erdogan , deplores the marginalisation of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious accusations .	-4.0919
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes , but defends the association line .	-3.3456
Now a new item is to be created .	-2.7059
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in Mesut Özil 's perpetual stride theme .	-5.2238
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne , the DFB boss defended the association line .	-5.9156
On early Sunday morning , the Grindel , who was personally attacked by Özil , announced the consequences of the Causa sports studio in Mainz .	-6.2556
" In future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U teams - we must draw very close conclusions that this does not happen again , " said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integrationswoman .	-6.9959
At the same time , Grindel once again declared that Erdogan did not support the values of football and the DFB .	-3.2420
In sharp terms , he denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan .	-3.2279
Our German-born and adult Mesut Özil and our Ilkay .	-3.3802
They have excluded them from this society because they were allowed to shoot with me in England , " Erdogan said on Saturday in the Cathedral City .	-4.9548
Frankly , as their president , I could not have believed that our two young men , who rose to the German national team , were excluded .	-5.8923
Grindel referred to Gündogan 's statement that , unlike Özil , he felt " sensibly treated by the DFB " after the World Cup affair , which began with photos of the two with Erdogan .	-5.2108
At the same time , he announced that he would face players in the future .	-3.9336
That someone says : if I win , I am German , if I lose , I am a migrant - that is not possible .	-3.3628
" I very much regret that he has such an impression , " Grindel said .	-2.8478
I have always said that we should have defended Mesut more .	-2.1147
However , he does not see any basis for Özil 's return to the national team .	-4.7003
As a consequence , in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic , who has family roots in Cameroon , an additional integrationist will be appointed .	-4.9791
" If a person without a migrant background has a clear influence on society and football and says : " The issue is important , we have to take care of it " , this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs , where integration has to work , " Grindel said .	-6.8281
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair , he wants to run again next year as president of the DFB .	-6.2307
" I do my job and try to do it as well as possible , " Grindel said .	-3.0379

At times , more than 1500 local forces tried to control the large-scale fire .	-5.3759

Switzerland Launches Electronic Register of Organ Donors	-2.1151
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members from stress .	-4.2968
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs can continue to be taken only with express consent , Swisstransplant emphasises .	-4.5400
( dpa ) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday .	-2.2949
This is to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members from stress .	-4.3067
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there .	-2.7762
Your wishes are then available from Swisstransplant if necessary .	-4.3539
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs can continue to be taken from organs only with express consent , as in Germany , Swisstransplant emphasises .	-4.9788
It is assumed that 15 % of Swiss citizens have a donor card , says Franz immer , Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation .	-4.4797
But only five per cent of cases will a card be found at the decisive moment in potential donors .	-5.0518
In more than 60 % of the conversations , the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased .	-4.2754
" You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased , which is often very burdensome " , says Always .	-4.7651
A similar registration system already exists in the UK .	-2.1850
In Germany , there are considerations of storing data on possible organ donation on the health card , as Marita Völker-Albert says .	-5.2465
" A register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation - is not available , " she says .	-7.8354
Federal Minister for Health Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation on organ donation .	-3.8031
According to his proposal , everyone would initially be regarded as organ donors , unless he or she disagree .	-5.3136
Among other things , the Catholic Church rejects this .	-2.5160

Greß was in Bielefeld two years ago when he was 14 years old .	-3.9216
With terms such as superbrain , genius or prodigy Laue can do little .	-6.1717
" Headcount can be trained , " he said .	-3.2370
Many participants spent several hours a day .	-3.1019
In India or Singapore , even stadiums have computer competitions .	-3.7727
Among the disciplines , for example , is the square root drawing from six-digit numbers .	-5.0951
When calculating the versatility , the candidates get surprise tasks for which they have to quickly find a solution strategy .	-6.0983
The Germans would also have a good chance here , said the chief judge .	-4.9099
Otherwise , Asians are often in advantage , because they learn headcount more intensively and with other effective methods even in early childhood .	-6.9016

The " green ramparts " , unique in Germany , have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for about 200 years .	-6.1179
The trees and shrubs , which are up to five metres wide , are " forest substitutes " and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms .	-5.6815
Knicks link scattered habitats , through which the exchange of organisms can still function , as the Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Union ( NABU ) in Schleswig-Holstein , Ingo Ludwichowski , said .	-5.0236
Knicks are Living Fences	-2.3048
The Knicks were founded on a command of the Dane King Christian VI in 1766 , which ruled Schleswig-Holstein .	-4.6236
The " living fences " were not only field limitation and cattle fence , they also supplied firewood and beams for their timbered houses .	-5.3445
His name " Knick " also dates from that time : the dense , intertwined boundaries could develop through " bending " the branches .	-7.0399
Today , between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea , some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch , giving the picture of a rich , varied , structured landscape .	-6.1923
According to NABU , around 7000 species of animals now use them as a substitute living space .	-5.3127
Up to 1,800 different species could live in one kilometre of Knick and breed up to 30 bird pairs .	-5.3569
However , the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter .	-4.2256
In addition to its biodiversity , Ludwichowski said that it is becoming a thin tree that also loses the wind protection effect .	-10.0039
According to the Ministry of Agriculture , kneading may only be carried out outside the breeding period from October to March .	-4.9460
After Tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia talks about local SITUATION .	-9.0321
In an interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) , the local radical Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquake and tsunami :	-3.6840
Were you on site during the tsunami ?	-2.8014
No , I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java .	-2.2566
When the earthquakes were , my wife called me , she was in Palu .	-2.0583
When I learned of the tsunami , I immediately went back to Sulawesi .	-3.2838
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport at Palu was closed at that time .	-4.0523
What is the situation on the island now ?	-1.5327
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in .	-2.6586
When I arrived , I saw the houses on the coast , all of which were completely destroyed .	-3.0960
Our office of " World Vision " has also been destroyed , but we have provisionally set up something to accommodate other people .	-4.4555
Where do the people living on Sulawesi now stand ?	-2.7953
Many have descended on surrounding hills , on which they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes , and where they have no access to water and food .	-5.4958
Some are standing in front of their homes , there are still aftershocks .	-4.4528
Because many grocery stores and the petrol stations are completely closed , people sometimes steal food and petrol .	-5.0723
The public service has been completely shut down and the national government is helping out .	-3.3541
A prison has also been destroyed , some of the prisoners are free to walk around , and finding them is difficult .	-6.6966
There are still many corpses around , many people have not yet been found and are missing .	-2.3795
How does communication and information provision work on the island ?	-3.2130
At the moment we have mobile phone reception , but it did not work before and we only got information via the radio .	-5.3212
Many people are still looking for their children , neighbours and other people , who do not know whether they live and where they are , because during the earthquakes people were not at home but on work , for example .	-5.0440
The tsunami warning system did not work properly .	-1.9008
Do you have any information on this ? ?	-1.8949
We do not know the reasons for this , but when the warning came , many thought ' okay , not a tsunami ' - and then he came .	-4.3160
In other regions not affected by the tsunami , there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains .	-4.0912
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Ring not prepared for earthquakes ?	-2.7585
But there are earthquakes every day , but that was the worst here .	-2.6766
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and train evacuation .	-2.9431
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed , and the earthquake has affected a great many people .	-7.0254

VfB Stuttgart did not make a forecast for the downtime .	-4.5321
A muscle fracture usually heals within six to eight weeks , a muscle fracture usually heals slightly faster .	-4.8334

But the first attempts to capture the ducks went wrong .	-2.5280
Despite the injury , it has been able to keep on evading the forces .	-5.5178
In the end , she fled to the lake .	-2.6554
With a rescue boat , the fire brigade could encircle the animal and push it back to land , where after almost an hour it was put into a transport box by a fire brigade with a courageous handle .	-6.0688
The duck injured at the breast was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim .	-4.4227
But , according to initial estimates , their chances of survival are rather small .	-2.9570

The last shot cost the 31-year-old person in the Pyeongchang Olympic Sprint the medal close to grabbing .	-5.9399
Seven tenths of a second failed to reach bronze .	-3.7963
" I have deliberately given myself time to process this , " says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden .	-4.8161
One medal was the goal , I was in top shape , but it simply did not want to be .	-3.1751
The Pinzgauer is therefore all the more motivated to make up for the failed precious metal in the new season : " The goal can only be to return with the constitution to a major event , to win something .	-5.6011
At some point you have to strike .	-3.6342
The World Cup track in Östersund ( SWE ) is Eberhard : " I have already closed the track to the heart " , he is pleased to recall his fourth World Cup course in the single race last year .	-6.2735

Brett Kavanaugh : FBI Investigation in Turbotempo	-1.7384
Time is extremely short and the number of proposed interrogations is very limited .	-3.5365
With an FBI investigation in the Turbotempo , the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a razor-thin majority for the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh .	-5.2799
President Donald Trump has set a Friday deadline for investigators to investigate alleged incidents over 30 years ago .	-3.6810
The recent turning point in the drama surrounding the appeal of Kavanaugh , accompanied by a cultural struggle , was triggered on Friday .	-4.1491
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor , Christine Blasey Ford , during which the jurist turned out angry tirades against opposition Democrats , the Senate Judicial Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative Justice in the US Supreme Court .	-5.6263
The Republican majority seemed certain when , contrary to his initial announcement , Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared that he would agree , but demanded an FBI investigation .	-3.9050
After tumultuous scenes , his party friends agreed .	-2.8677
President Trump , who referred to Thursday 's harsh reprimands as ' besess ' , initially abstained from further attacks on women and , on the contrary , spoke of ' happiness in disaster ' .	-6.9404
In this way , last doubt could be overcome , he said .	-3.6455
Later , in an election rally , Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh : " They are trying to block and destroy . "	-4.4502
Trump ’ s FBI Investigation in Kavanaugh	-3.4804
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators .	-2.4012
There will be a targeted investigation into the well-known accusations made by two women , but nothing more , as one government official told the Wall Street Journal : ' They are not going on a fishing trip ' .	-7.5945
According to the New York Times , only four witnesses are to be heard .	-1.9815

FC Schalke 04 After Victory Against Mainz : Feeling Fear	-3.2129
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first season victory against Mainz .	-2.9000
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory .	-2.7558
However , the factor of time also played a role against Mainz .	-3.9460
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches .	-4.2066
This was no different in the home match against Mainz 05 .	-2.5811
" I saw every ball in it .	-1.7222
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room , " said Schalke 's Sports Board 04 - and breathed up .	-3.6275
After all , the royal blue still managed to finalise the close 1 : 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first season victory .	-6.0578
It could have been otherwise .	-3.8870
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of chief coach Domenico Tedesco had made sure : " In sum , the first half was good , both playful and from pressing " .	-15.5593
Don ’ t Shape a Headball Monster	-4.3588
" The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me , " Heidel said : " If the team was only half as nervous as I was at the bank , I can understand that " .	-4.5368
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore they were withdrawing further and further .	-6.6999
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz .	-2.3967
To save the first three meters of the season .	-1.6158
" We all liked a huge stone from the heart , " said Schöpf , who did not play an insignificant part in this with his headball hit : " I am actually the worst football player in the team " .	-6.6622
But , in the end , only victory matters .	-2.7922
The relief was felt throughout the arena , including , of course , in the case of Inglese .	-5.2035
" We wanted to start in the early stages and make a firework out of it , " Schalke 's chief coach said .	-5.5766
Victory was important .	-0.8238
At last we can look forward to a few hours .	-3.3974
I am very , very happy for the team and the fans .	-1.3481
We played intelligently , calmly and courageously , so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes .	-4.2741
Perhaps the biggest shortcoming in the afternoon : royal blue missed to worry more about clearer conditions .	-5.5507
The possibilities were finally there , for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka , who twice met the Latte 59 / 72 or Amine Harit 62 .	-4.7988
" Then it would not have been a lizard , " said Temeco : " You have already felt fear a little .	-7.6316
I am therefore pleased that we have won .	-1.9423
So he was not the only shaker .	-7.7113
Fischbachau : Smoke Column in the Leitzach Valley 2 km visible	-3.9887

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration : An equal discussion .	-3.4536
In front of them is the author , Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani .	-3.4027
He has again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild .	-3.7567
" I have been trying to get interesting people to Greven for many years , " explains the founder and chairman of the " Reckenfelder Treffen " - the association that cooperates with the Alliance of Cultural Policy in organizing the evening .	-6.7146
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely , describes the writing process of the book , talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way .	-4.2726
With a lot of gestures , hard numbers and a little joke , he brings one of the most conflictual themes closer to the audience : migration and integration .	-6.6600
Why , despite successful integration , are conflicts increasingly arising ?	-2.9654
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question .	-2.3020
At one table , German society is sitting around the corner , and first generation migrants are sitting around the corner .	-5.8313
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table .	-2.9041
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany , they have always sat at the big table and now want to have their say .	-3.7774
This leads to conflict .	-1.6888
The decisive factor , therefore , is not whether one is politically right or left , but : ' Am I for or against an open society ? ' , he stresses .	-5.6858
At first , the discussion round is getting more and more lively .	-6.6791
And there is room for speech .	-4.5469
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective that two teachers tell us how they see successful or not successful integration among students .	-4.3309
El-MaMaMaMaalani , not on stage , represents the discussion : it is on an equal footing .	-4.8613
The sociology professor does not express his opinion , stresses that he talks about the average , not about individual fates .	-6.0464
He is pleased that there is an interest in the subject , because ' only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions ' , says El-MaMaMapaalani .	-5.1073
During the following signing hour he was also open to the questions of the guests and was also discussed intensively in the foyer in the case of prepared Kurdish specialities .	-7.0422

Then the award can be made .	-4.2044

That is how Schalke 's Naldo ' Great Sport ' also works at the Bank .	-4.6652
For the third time in a row not in the grid : Nevertheless , Naldo thanks Domenico Tedesco at Schalke Trainer .	-6.3270
Gelsenkirchen - For the third time in a row Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues did not sit in the Schalker Startable but on the Exchange Bank , the understanding would have been great for many people if the nearly two meter large Brazilian had really spoken the frustration of the soul .	-7.5077
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle , as usual , after the 1 : 0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 , and the chief coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his pros , the 36 year-old , who everyone is easy to call Naldo , turned in and said : " We have to thank trainer ! "	-7.3498
" This was very emotional , it was great sport , " said Tedesco later about the reaction of his vice-captain , who , despite his renewed reservist existence , had no resentment whatsoever .	-6.2459
Probalích knows that Naldo , who was celebrated last season as the best shaker , has not really got on his coach 's back - he gets a break for good reasons .	-8.0945
A reason called " stress control " .	-3.5107
It was not easy to tell him that .	-1.8196
" It was not easy to tell him that , I tell you quite honestly , " said Tedesco from the moment he said to Naldo that he was not in the grid .	-5.9650
He is an important player , he is an important person .	-1.9632
But it is always about the thing , it is about the association " , founded Tedesco the step .	-5.3811
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes .	-1.6963
He is 36 years old .	-0.7742
It is important that everyone is able to get through at the moment .	-4.4197
And that we all keep in the boat , " explained Tedesco the rotation , which last also caught Naldo .	-4.4565
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age : by also proving to be an exemplary team player at the bank .	-4.2061
The mood in Austria ’ s industry accelerated its decline compared to the eurozone in August .	-3.7747
The Purchasing Manager Index ( PMI ) was at a 37-month low at 46.7 points .	-3.3113
In Europe , Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands , the Markit Institute announced on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies .	-5.9483
Unlike in Austria , the euro zone PMI rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points , but the index is still below the 50 count mark for the 13th consecutive month , which suggests growth .	-6.0442
Only Ireland 's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points .	-3.5289
The Greeks were at the bottom ( 42.1 points ) .	-3.0510
In Germany , France , and Spain , the mood barometer fell , but more slowly than in the months before .	-3.0597
In Spain , the index reached its highest level of 44.0 points since March .	-3.4006
" The slightly weakened decline may mean that the worst is over , " Markit economist Rob Dobson said .	-4.1742
But industry remains number one - at least in the third quarter .	-3.1560
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight : export orders in the eurozone have fallen as fast as they have since November 2011 .	-4.7526
Companies therefore lost jobs for the seventh consecutive month .	-3.7969
In China , too , industrial production fell sharply in August than was initially assumed .	-4.7603
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points .	-1.9336
