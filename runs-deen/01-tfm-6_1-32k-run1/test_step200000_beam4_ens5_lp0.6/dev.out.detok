Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city.
A misleading institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A mine chapel where is now digging for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former reason of farmers.
Munich ’ s oldest official map reveals exciting stories.
It is nervous when maps are not up to date..,,.,,.,..,,.
Anyone who has had to get out of trouble because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the Bayern-Atlas digital, an offer from the geoportal Bavaria to the state government, are far from current - but very revealing.
Especially when you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the area of Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps of cities and municipalities have been incorporated into the large overview map, known as the location sheets.
The Bavarian survey conducted between 1810 and 1864 and resulted from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition war.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographic admission of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course, for military.,,,,,.
Even though French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian card.
Kurfürst Max IV, Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Survey Management "..,,,. in.,,,. in.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.
The comparison of Early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was considered as a district of Munich 21 years after drawing up the map, i.e. 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the heart of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered pieces from the so-called "outpost" from which the land tax was derived.
Small plots no longer bear farmers there - but small gardeners of the land in the sun.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese has been the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow - rather than a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the site of the current Au-Haidhausen district you read not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the elevations "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt ".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße, people once locked up with madness.
The Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was born in 1858 / 59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the embellishments of the so-called errors.
He has also banned the staff from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked with the institution for an exhibition.
There was space for 280 patients, and later expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circle irrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper Clinic Munich Ost, one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatry has been located there since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training enterprises.
To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV München Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015 the children ’ s house Casa Don Bosco was built in 2015, in architectural terms of the origins of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War.
Marienplatz was recorded as "Haupt Platz" around 1856, and the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
World War II brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs crashed many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a mine chapel dating back to the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where the preparatory work is carried out these days and on 5 April 2017 the second S-Bahn line.
The slider allows you to compare the old Munich card to today's aerial view - and fill the hole at Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri because of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and missionaries to pay particular attention and caution when travelling through the state, because a series of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state," says the group's opinion.
A recent Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, and the law enforcement authorities of the state aimed disproportionately at minorities, led the group to issue the travel warning, NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped for their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
'We hear complaints in such frequency which we have not heard yet. '
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization to a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances earlier this year, after he had no gasoline during his trip through the state and was arrested by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.
The Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Missouri, which shows that black drivers are held 75% more frequently than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
'People must be prepared whether they bring bail-out money or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state. '
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime report, which classify the state to 16th place in terms of the number of such injuries.
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaun Project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU Parliament, Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on the ground.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association association with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann gave an insight into his company, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest milk" is the alternative way of marketing for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
The holiday guests ’ table is exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaun project as "elementary importance".
I cannot do profitably on such steep areas.
The green area provides a lot of work, much needs to be done with the Motorsense.
"We are struggling with the conditions and topography", emphasized Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a biofarm.
For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The commune recognized the importance of the Weidezaunch project and is pleased with the Leader Promotion".
Farmers should be supported at a cost of EUR 3000 to 4 000 per hectare.
It is hoped that this would allow the reforestation of the land for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they can continue their operations," said the mayor.
Farmers are often criticized for promoting promotion.
In 2013, 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.
The surface area is 40 hectares, which must not be covered by at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was supported by Leader, and one quarter was the municipality of Fischerbach.
As a result, farmers left EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of willow fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of fences", explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a good job, without farmers and rural women '.
Peter Weiß also stated: "Here best food is produced".
Baden-Württemberg (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state funding of wheat fences.
The aim is to open up the Black Forest.
A prerequisite is the existence of a support framework defined by LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced cannot be traceable (slope over 35%) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build nearly 16 km of.
The area of open space corresponds to 35 hectares and the costs calculated above EUR 112 000.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump ’ s White House is assuming
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate it as much as anyone else – hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN Acosta about the president ’ s proposals to drastically limit legal immigration with the statue of liberty.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A Horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have merged him if he had done so.
But he attacked its significance, and especially the importance attributed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller Acosta shouted, "I do not want to go into a complete thing about history, but the statue of freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom '.
Miller is correct, but, as he himself put it, it is not really about history.
It is about contemporary resonance to the crippling words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: 'Your efforts, your poor, / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts.'
There was never a time when the 'miserable waste' on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US.
This conflict because of the importance of statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict over America ’ s significance.
Lazarus - and her friends who worked to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a disused classical visual representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: the mother of exiles.
The poem ’ s connection with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people on the right wanted to change this for a long time.
The great shrewd Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for Trump ’ s coming, argued in 2010 that the statue of liberty does not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not shed the way to the United States. '
Almost unusual, Limbaugh encountered something here.
The importance of statue is entirely a question of the position of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often dreadful trips on the decks of ships.
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And, of course, that is not the prospect that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch is not intended to illuminate the way, but to spark hatred which is their only source of power.
The 2017 World Cup: Neil Black prats Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team.
The UK ’ s performance director Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team in the World Cup cadre.
A record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for London in 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that 'something special is developing in Scotland' and that the UK's athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it out," said Black.
"I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. '
Several of the Scottish athletes are Medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected as a team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great. '
The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete at her fifth World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup has been seven in 1983 and 2015.
The medium-haul runner Muir is heading along this path, setting up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot was in Team Lee McConnell.
The team chapter says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases, will also be involved in medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team chapter is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and voted it makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise on podiums.
With regard to my speech as captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium.
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere outside '.
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don ’ t worry about public office if you can ’ t stand up for voters to stoke voters.
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to its political principles.
He spurred criticism, certainly.
But he has not silenced his critics.
In 1783, Washington said: 'Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we will be slaughtered like sheep'.
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
That is why the American Civil Liberties Union accused him earlier this week.
The Staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?".
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it is important.
And it is especially important when it is a type like hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in managing his state and strict respect for principles.
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters and playing his haggling head to chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come on the side of the governor - who is a public forum known as official and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended governor ’ s actions, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swinging the stick online.
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a parish, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profan.
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasser, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news program "The Post".
'I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people speak on the same subject, some people disregard them as a so-called collective effort and do not recognise them as a large group of citizens affected '.
What governors ’ staff called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call "advocacy".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in previous times to have done the same thing that workers were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week.
Loudoun County ’ s Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the affordable porto had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters suggested his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that crushed Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, Trade, and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Northern Ireland, which last year led links in Archerfield until the final round before losing Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieved his fame with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He is a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course. '
The English Eales looks forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won his 32-year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"This really feels special," said the Southport player.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate '.
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I am glad to see what happened. '
The trio in the field are former master winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, while others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, parking costs £5 per car with an occupant and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Less lung cancer through passive smoking
Over the last two decades, fewer people have died from lung cancer because of passive smoking.
This result is a study by scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are caused by passive smoking per year," said Head of study Heiko Becher.
In comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Households are very complex
The construction work in Villinger Straße are in full swing and "lie somewhat in time", says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, because there is a lot of hidden underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which constantly hinders construction work, is a major problem for Stumpp construction.
"The ignorance of the car drivers in front of red traffic lights and jams is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were pretty exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water ", says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia ’ s Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a cook.
It rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai reign in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the coated bones will be taken out and wrapped with icy, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the Lehmboden - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, for example to wash clothes with water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a rootless space serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, to work late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m." she says.
It is a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, adopted after a controversial referendum in Indonesia in 1969, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public handsurvey.
An existing movement that promoted independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excluding foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is, with a 90 minutes flight from in Ja, and then a 5-hour..
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roof, converted into various yellow brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans honored a God called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We were not accustomed to wearing these clothes," says Degei and indicates her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and light rock.
'Earlier we only had leaves on our bodies'.
Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport dismantled $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
Moreover, Papua has an estimated $78 billion of timber resources.
But these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military and units almost $20 million from 1998 to 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goo and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed, and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua ’ s tribal chiefs in the 1970 ’ s became genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
A 2016 report by the Archdiocese Brisbane, which contains reports of previous year's atrocities, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung-Kantins sell fried chicken and Gado, a mixed vegetables with pepper sauce served.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura.
'It cost the local Papua - the Mama Mama [the women] of Papua - their market. '
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, commonly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts have broken because we voted in favour of Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored," You.
Indeed, only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the dark on a motorcycle.
The shocked children told them that they should turn their headlights on.
One of the soldiers took action and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk and threw the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set fire, and things escalated the next day.
Around 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice.
They performed ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - continuously imitating a bird song - by Papua Mee Pago-Stamm.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command of an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot dead," says in an official TIME document that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for calm and called on the crowd to return home.
Nobody was listening.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was it," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in bleak mood.
'I saw that he was dead... I knocked him. '
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the Papua police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
'It is about life and death. '
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators have been killed and many others injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only the following day.
Three weeks ago, Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the victims ’ families and vowed to address the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historical violations of human rights.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000 ’ s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be passed, "he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said that he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, charged by the UN for 'crimes against humanity', which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of Paniai victims took such allegations with grim disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
'I am tired '.
He says that he still lives in fear.
'I am afraid, 'he says.
'I fear of being arrested by the military, fear of being shot. '
His brother Yacobus, repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After having buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniai neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Enlightened villagers protested in front of the company ’ s site office.
The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting on the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered, says TIME.
'I hid myself in my house for two days'.
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be brought to account and to withdraw the police mobile brigade from the area..
Paniai has always been an unrest for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained on the pretext of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some never recur.
Among the people of Papua Paniai is known as' a tragic, forgotten place '.
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here are building everything they eat: nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women who can deal with four or five fields of sweeteners.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between local Papua and new migrants, who have reached greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills needed to lead their own companies competitive.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting by international media remain tense.
At the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troublesome eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua: visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
A lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the 'various and widespread injuries' in Papua, including the Paniai foundry.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta: 'There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and there is free media so it is difficult to conceal evidence of human rights cases'.
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people broke their silence and afflicted him 'We want freedom', according to a source that also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai slices," says Gobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from being under the constant threat of a predatory military, the Paniai people are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must repay.
'They do not need money, they just want justice, 'he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: a victim's corpse was buried on a site just against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a reduced head.
'What else can we do? '
Fire Scattering Dubai ’ s Torch skyscraper for the second time
A fire found his diary in one of the world ’ s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of people to flee from the 337 metre high 79-floor building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we stood up with fire alarm and shouting people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "said a resident who had his name as George angab, Reuters.
Dublin's civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units at 4: 00 local time (00.00 GMT) cleaned the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outskirts around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage came from dressing, exterior clothing for decoration or insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that they believed that the plates system of isolating and disguise at the Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which some 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: Continue Best of five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed to attend the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup cou., and.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and
At the Ho Chi Minh City meeting, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single on two wins was not backed by the required two-thirds majority.
These are often very long but also highly valued for this reason, remain the traditional competition.
63.54% of member countries voted in favour of the reform, and ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal was barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our members did not adopt the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions, "said Haggerty.
Work will continue to improve the job.
After many objections, the proposal was made to hold the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: for example, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host rights in the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, training places and so on, and players will have to finish less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US passengers brings banned objects into the plane, finds a poll.
A flight passenger survey found that more than 20% deliberately or unconsciously banned items at the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points, including at least 6% that entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1% claimed that they had been late discovered that they were wrong with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that younger travellers are more disregarding the rules.
Of those respondents who admitted that they consciously tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7% were millennials, compared to less than 15%, were members of generation X.
The most common items deliberately bypassed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% admitted that they had deliberately carried blades through security control, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it consulted travellers across the country to find out how many accidental smuggling goods could have brought through airport security and how many people would have done intentionally.
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry smugglers - knowingly or ignorant - through safety were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain what liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by TSA are banned.
For a while, people thought TSA could see books as smuggling.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn ’ t matter: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
To date, he has suppressed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the constantly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced another less glorious number when he announced the recent quarterly balance sheet: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk had often advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the $1000 in the US and 1000 pounds in the UK).
There were 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted at a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling approximately 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: the challenge of the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models put together, it should be 500,000, and one million in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
If there are major delays, however, the non-binding nature of reservations may become a problem for Tesla.
Because then, the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running out in many cases.
Pruitt is withdrawing because of the delay in Obama ’ s rules to reduce emissions.
One day after he had been indicted by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency ’ s head, resigned his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smog pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved responsive to the needs of public environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the case that had been brought against his previous post in a Federal Appeal Court.
It is about a deadline set for states on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Appeal Court in Washington ruled that the EPA manager exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanleaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his U-turn in ozone standards simply reinforce EPA ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards in good time.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and to set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in legal proceedings and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority we have. '
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use its' power to delay and all other legally available powers' to ensure that the rules are 'based on sound policies and the best available information'.
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Prosecutor General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sue the EPA this week, said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of EPA - after our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered about Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
'We must continue to fight against the Trump administration ’ s ideological crusade of bending to polluters and their special interests. '
Tumlingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefit sites can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The preservation and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made the friends and sponsors Tumlingens.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village jewel".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first written in the Württembergischer book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
In addition to the former parish church, there was a stately court, to which the church or patronage law and not vice versa.
So there were people there.
As shown in the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, the "Mountain" was the third, the dominant settlement center of the village.
Old maps dating back to the year 1600 underpin these historical realities.
The patronage law was created from the early medieval self-church law.
A Lord who built, equiped a church and occupying a parish remained the owner of this church and could inherit this church.
This was the right to appoint a parish or to propose a new parish to the bishop.
Three altars were in the church and two bells on the tower.
The biggest of the two crushed on Christmas 1673.
The new bell was then used for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the Thirty Years War (1616 to 1648) the windows were insulated and the bells stolen.
The roof was leaked.
In 1796 French troops were located near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was broken.
Only the church tower was left to stand.
In the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was cancelled.
Only the tower dwarf still exists today as a witness to the 750 years old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen pensioners" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.
On Sunday, July 16, the friends and sponsors Tumlingens invite to the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilarius Chapel.
This will be developed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and Reinhold Matteis.
Count Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Entry is from 3.30 p.m.
For the end of the Serenade there is an Umtrunk in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers show the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers are hoping for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius complex, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors Tumlingens are particularly committed to homecare, as Serenade-organizer Walter Martini confirmed.
Association wants to have approval by windmills.
"Boisheim fights" does not see a legal precondition for the construction and has therefore approached the Council.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" invited Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.
It was illegal.
The Association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, because at the time in Viersen, there was only a wind power concentration zone on the city border of Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone will exclude wind energy use for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent the "sparing" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette in Boisheimer Nette - but this was not approved by the district government of Düsseldorf because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the approval certificate granted is still illegal and therefore to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim resists.
The current state of affairs: the municipal council decided again the wind concentration zone in Boisheim Nette Nette before the summer recess; permission from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This means the granting of permission for the construction of wind turbines".
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The relevant letters have received from the Viersen district since last week," said a speaker.
The circle is taking them as an opportunity to look at the matter again.
However, they are unlikely to lead the process being stopped.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district did not want to comment on the grounds of the association "Boisheim defends himself".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW Re, is planning to build four wind wheels each 200 metre high on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares.
The four wind turbines will be able to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households, which corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity demand of all four households.
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Auto and tractor crashes together: woman dies in a terrible accident.
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhine-Lahn).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were easily injured.
The provincial road remained closed for hours.
After police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich, with her passenger car in the course of accompanying driving with her 53-year-old mother, the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and traders are planning a 'Home Shots' weekend '
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are supposed to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the municipal administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract residents to the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shop shop" weekend is to raise awareness about the offers of their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods.
It is therefore planned to have a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are invited to "midnight shopping".
The action aims not only to residents of the city and the region.
In preparation are advertisements on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that indicate the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The municipal administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
In this way, the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive City".
These include new offers, such as the first "Active Day" at the Brunnenfest with the sale Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be re-opened or again.
These include spa guests and tourists.
However, many locals would also have lost sight of downtown when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revitalise the city centre, including landlords, businesses and clubs.
King had said in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, said that five cities in Thuringia are participating for the first time at the nationwide third "home shop".
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities," he says.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners, also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his own direct environment.
Two deaths and several injuries after the US School

The dead were employees of the school.
The authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of holiday, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump pressured Mexico ’ s payment of the Border Wall after leaked transcripts of telephone calls for the Border Wall.
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump, in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President shouted him for having publicly denounced the wall, and reportedly said to him: 'You cannot tell the press that'.
Trump launched his presidential campaign, promising to build a wall on the US southern border, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts from his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US is "ridiculous," mies "and" stupid ", and" stupid ", and that the insistence on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a" depp "after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after he said to Mr Turnbull, 'that is the most unpleasant call for all day'.
Moores Ford Massacres: Activists resume racist Lynchakt as an appeal for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury travelled through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumped on the Ford bridge of Moore., and.,.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men emerged with guns to block his path.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked at the windscreen.
The inmates swept into fear.
"We want these n ---- r Roger!
'Get it out of the car! '
Shrine torn the silence when a young black man was dragged by the front-passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, is only a reflection.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone came up with very real sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night, in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were chanted by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
Nobody has ever been accused of murder.
"It is truly incomprehensible that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organise repatriation.
'It is a jewel in a history, but it is a burden on our souls'.
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of Georgia and a civil rights activist.
For him, posture serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want an end, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice '.
A court doctor lays a bedlinen on the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But nobody has ever been accused.
Although suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for Lynch actions was always known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a ruling by the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time to vote in the summer ’ s pre-election campaign.,,,..,,.,,...
Around the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom, stacked a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a battle - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumors had been in the city that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to liberate Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they departed from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
'It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses'.
Brooks puts it even more concise.
'It was an electoral massacre, "he said.
'You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, then that will happen to you.'
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual rendition of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.
Their presentation is illustrative, appealing and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe it no longer exists in America.
It is hard to look and even harder to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch, because then we will face its hardness in all of us," she said.
"But I cannot build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have gone through".
The samples for this year ’ s production began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest black - pushed into a room and listened to Greene started a well-recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said that the role never becomes easier.
"I feel dirty because I am not so," said Marbaugh.
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times'.
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who attacks the army and afflicts him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
'I said n --- he disappeared from my property! '
Rascona replies the fire.
There is a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!", Ras asked..
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still kicking.
'I simply do not think that white people said 'n --- he'.
"But", "one of the other black performers.
'You only have to hit the hard 'R.'.
This is where energy shifts in the room, a feeling of comrade replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it loud and forcefully.
Nobody laughs at all.
This repetition ends violent and rapid.
There are cries, shots and then silence.
A woman with a sorrow, stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind a group of about four dozen viewers sweat and tears out their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple travelled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many of them just down the street.
They have experienced Georgian expressive humidity every almost eight hours when Brooks leads them to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgri.
To this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels thrilled.
When the final notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the surname.
Children hock at their heads, register counterfeit blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other.
"They are not really dead", a little boy murmurs as if he might remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanked the crowd - and suddenly it is over.
The actors throw away the Lynch part and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms, and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay", one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did so for one reason. '
Later, the audience collaborates with actors for dinner.
At a table, a white pair from Atlanta shouts over the posture with a black pair that they have just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that feeling the performance left.
"It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... come from people who look like you and who do so because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on," she added, "today it is only called a police foundry."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks ’ yard keeps on his table, he eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The posture is somewhat inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It is the case that if we do not learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, who do not know their own history are condemned to repeat it '.
"Gods Demon" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful frivolous staging of a gigantic six-storey backdrop.
The stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) displays a shabby street corner with the wall and dönerbude in Berlin, a "plastic and elaste" logo from the DDR era or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, there is an open Mercedes classic car in which the Rhine daughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Castorf oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which is drawn through its "ring" production.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise as they did in the "Rhine gold".
Kess seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), torn a body in the boot room and give the cradle clique.
Stephen Milling sings the beautiful hagen surrounding the aura of a heavy-boxer.
Brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must believe.
The audience thanks to the ensemble with strong applause.
The festivities are fosters, milling, vinke and conductor Janowski, who humiliate themselves and disguise their hands to the Mercury.
The festival orchestra, which is showing itself on stage for the first time - in the light of the great heat, again, in the light of the great heat.
Frank Castorf and his director was eagerly awaited.
In 2013 he had to endure a whistle concert in 2013, five years later, there was great jubilee in which the isolated "buh" calls.
Katharina Wagner should have liked this.
"It is noticeable that the audience grew up with the" ring ", she said just before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also an understanding of his view.
I would like to draw up a positive conclusion..
Max Menge Working as a Voluntary
They work in several places during their voluntary year.
Where everywhere?
Number: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the Furniture Bridge.
And I worked at school in the open whole day.
What is your experience with this?
Number: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, young people, refugees and young adults.
They are now 26 years, a late working volunteer.
How does that come?
Number: I made Abitur.
And then a construction engineer study, let us say, successfully aborted.
I realized that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else, working with people.
And then I wondered what are you doing.
Make a social year, there is a glimpse, and you can see what it really is on the ground.
And was it so?
Number: I have gathered great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker education at the Herne Youth Office and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the voluntary service?
Set: Yes, it is very variable.
It is always important where to do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the UCS, that is, in the afternoons.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that caused me.
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works..,.,.,,..,,.
Unlike in the Bauengineer study?
Set: Well, this is not about calculating statics.
There are other people in front of their heads, each with a very different story.
Whether a refugee, or a young person who has been taken out of the family - we must always deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of contact?
Number: I am not the type.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love and kindness.
There are also negative moments, but this is the case that life is like.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive the business.
On Friday, the British educational group Pearson said that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72%, as another restructuring programme would be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing.
The job cuts, which Director-General John Fallon announced mostly at the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced a $300 million cost reduction plan in a third cost reduction program ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid digital learning step.
The company, which sold its participation in Penguin Random House last month, said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after reaching £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Konvoi attack by Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack.
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured, announced a NATO declaration.
Unconfirmed local reports that three civilians died in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement states that the explosion took place on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was' attacked 'by an improvised explosive attack'.
The statement says that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on Bagram.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh, is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a largely Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since the US-led troops in 2001.
The violence underscores Afghanistan ’ s precarious security situation, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police forces in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
EPA reverses decision to delay the Smog Rule
The US Environmental Protection Agency has repealed a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration requiring states to contain smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the Agency for the step.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called 'ozone rules 2015' and said that it showed the Agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in our response to our state partners," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's intention to delay the ozone rules - which will measure pollutant emissions in one part of the country in order to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by a year by October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to cut down a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump is supposed to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups, which worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that breathing air containing ozone can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Local Council wants Community space
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winches decided to establish a Community area in the future for the elderly.
There is an important information before the discussion: The purchase contract for the missing part of the property has been signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take time before the parish area of the parish remains in the community, there is no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be stamped by a private investor.
There is a discussion on a Community area.
One of the two investors still on board has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - about 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square metres of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council envisages such a common area not just as a meeting place for the residents of senioren-just living, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision that was made by the allocation of funds for the current budget last autumn will be complemented by funding opportunities.
The construction is located in the rehabilitation area.
The creation of a Community area, according to Tjaden, would be eligible for 60% of 30%.
The proposal for a decision, in order to send a signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a stick between their feet, it makes it possible to establish that both the saddle - which is based on the environment - and a powder roof - which reduces the grape level and makes the construction of economic - would.,,,,,,,,, and..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not only Wilfried Sohmer says, is this addition.
If it helps, it happens unanimously.
The common area is not easy.
Daniela call refers to the many own buildings that are not making the most of them, but they are now out of the window in the community, she says: 'I am doing a hard job'.
Yvonne Staiger is very much in favour of the common area - but it is absolutely opposed to local participation.
It sees a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give a subsidy, but will get a real value, marketable in case of doubt, is the counter-argument.
Staiger ’ s request to split the proposal for a decision to be split accordingly.
Thus, with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes: 'If we take the decision in this way, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure'.
Collision with Auto: Cyclists on the street

Hiking from Stern to Star to Star
In the Harz, the first "Star Path" is to be created in Germany..
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans this.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the need for information of many harbor visitors.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well accessible installations in five to six places" in Oberharz.
The infrastructure of St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels should be supplemented by the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Path will be extended by train.
"On the startup the observer will learn a lot about the physics of each star," explained the association.
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why one star shines brighter than another, though it is far further away.
It is also mediated in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see.
Since 2014, the association has operated the highest star service in North Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are visible.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned starwerg - the Planetenweg.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steels up to the Hainberg and to the observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (municipality of equen) with the planet Sedna.
The stelen with the individual planets - including the degraded pluto at the end point - are positioned precisely at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth is shrinking to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters, while the sun is exactly 75 meters away, measuring 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres.
While light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than light in the world.
But the march to the next fixed star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing battle under 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unrivalled World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Champion.
After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision over the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for Pound-list.
Garcia stretched the right hand and said: "How do you, Champion?
I wish you good luck '.
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis climbed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect magnitude".
"I am a former feather weight," reminded Garcia.
"I am for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I am small for 140.
I would like to come down to lightweight.
And he must move on lightweight weights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That is what the fans are demanding.
Let us give them that '.
Lomachenko agreed.
'Boxes need this fight '.
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight race in the forum on September 23.
"This battle could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for him," said Garcia and later expressed himself openly to fight the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... '
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as' an enormous fighter ', and he may be taking part in his Saturday campaign.
But Lomachenko stayed in the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the Riverside triathlon Champion from Riverside look "very slowly, sorry Mikey... you wanted the Ko-out".
Garcia said that the focus is to show strength, then boxes.
Both said they could feel the momentum built for their own struggle.
"This is the battle that must be waged.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I waited for the top fighters, and that is Mikey.
It will be a great battle. '
Four injured after Reifenplatzer
In the event of an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the junction of the market wide, probably lost control of his vehicle after a tyre.
The car moved to the right into the ground, where it flooded and then remained on the roof in the green.,,.,,.,,.,,. in.

Fortunas Hoffmann: 'Threette works better' '
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2: 2 at the end of the season against Braunschweig, the optimisation of the defensive formation in Aue points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season match, with the result, if not the two opposing gates at the 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two opposing gates too much, and we need to be more vigilant in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf defender.
In the Erzgebirge, the triple-chain should be further optimized.
And a gate after a release, the fortunes do not want to catch up.
'For the future it will be the case that no one will take the line alongside Michael (Rensing). '
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope with the tripartite chain than with the four-wheel chain.
"I don't know how we are going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have in the triangle of Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
'Precondition is, but that we harmonise even better and that we do not make so many mistakes in the building '.
Of course Hoffmann also travels to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw.
The performance may well be okay, "Hoffmann said.
'If, however, we can stand with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the Cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start of the season '.
His coach did not want to know that.
"I will judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of matches," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the Saxony's game had to be aborted prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that Aue's players might even be a bit fresher, because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a win win.
"But they don't know as 100% where they currently stand," says Fortuna's interior defender.
It is true that guests from the Rheinland as a lighter favourite on Sunday to meet at the last (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we are sweeping them away just because we have the claim to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is positive in only a defeat against Aue from nine matches.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
'Making such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant '.
And so Funkel never wants to experience his players on Sunday.
Published New Results of Sweden ’ s AsylAge Review Review Review
The recent results of tests for asylum-seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method for assessing their age, show that more than 80% of the people tested are over 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Count Food Sale) started carrying out the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are intended to clarify the assessment of age when the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Sale) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor.
Migration Sale has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were considered 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been steady in recent months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases suggesting that the person investigated is 18 years or older '.
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 findings, she found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of Weisheity and MRT recordings of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes evaluating human biological maturity to see whether, sooner or later, they went through puberty.
"I had reason to think about this, and I do not think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say it safely, we should not pretend that we could, "he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is below 18, in this case, about 10%. "
Full the Plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstrasse 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven tons of heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in the time, it is running super," says Reinhold Leicht, building manager at the Department of Road and Transport in Freiburg.
In April, the work began at the same time on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Laut..,.,,.,.,.,
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted arch bridge, covered with red bunt and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach.
They are made of red bunts.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, respectively 10.60 metres long.
On Wednesday morning, the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tons tons of heavy cargo.
This is a peripheral fixation which is also used as a business route.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 metres wide bridge will be deployed on Friday.
This is the pedestrian path.
The particular thing is that they are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with patented bridge caps.
A special sense of sensitivity has required the laying of wires through the building in Lauterbach.
There is also a fiber fiber cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of work by handlists.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collective wine in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by an traffic light.
For construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is closed.
The cost of the three bridge renovations amount to EUR 700 000.
It is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German potato salad
It ’ s not so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD) comes together, which is difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that is peacefully demonstrating the flag on this day because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster "big campaign campaign.
And famous names, like Alice Weidel, who, together with Alexander Gauland, is the top duo for the federal election on September 24, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on the ground hours before the event begins, do not want to listen to the AfD students, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "Everyone at one table" on the fountain square, but it is now taking place at the car park below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that is available.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forum One World and one of the authoritative organizers, is right: 'Toll, how many people have gathered here'.
There is music and plenty of food, including a "urdeutsche potato salad, which the AfD could eat without any problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police ordered many civil servants to Gerolstein, and they show presence, especially at the railway station, which is just a few metres from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported on the AfD volcano eifel that he tried to make such an event and received the prize.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but received a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event at Rondellvorplatz he says: "This is the right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful '.
It does so: at 8 p.m. there is a band for entertainment at Rondellvorplatz, and various speakers in the Stadthalle, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD Chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to make their..
The police presence has not changed, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts slightly more than an hour, the guests on the ground have a longer breath, but there is also a need to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can move away - no special events.

This core piece of the programme was premiered in Freiburg only this spring with great success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: the Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics, is deliberately included in the concert.

Perhaps some people call me indebtedness, but I do not like to have to justify myself before the whole public. '
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the Party
. The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me, "Governor Justice said.

The rally broke out in jubilee.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
'As a coach, I would say that it is time to play another game. '
Mr. Trump promised a major announcement before the West Virginia Rallye.

Coe praises' honest 'Russian apology for Doping scandal
The world leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday, praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the moment for the country to resume sport.
Russia ’ s athletics leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the athletics World Championships that his country ’ s exile was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said that he was sorry for 'all athletes who were shot away at competitions'.
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe said to the reporters.
'The whole Council and the whole of Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned '.
Coe said he was also 'pleased' that Russia accepts the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to re-re-establish Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Championships starting in London on Friday in London.
The head of the IAAF-Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate, and banned coaches are still free, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Sadly for Soldiers in Mali
At a ceremony in Fritzlar in northern Hessen, about 1000 people of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Cathedral city under high security precautions.
Secretary of Defense Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unresolved crash issue.
However, she described the two reversed pilots as' experts'.
"We bow to this highest sacrifice that they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Stabshauptman from Northern Hesse died in Mali, West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Her singers were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death guard from the Bundeswehr to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At noon, only the members of the church took leave.
After that, the wedding ceremony began in the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and the politics.
These include Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Trauergästes laid down roses, the relatives stood arms in arms.
In front of the church, Fritzlarers and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Secretary of Defense of the Leyen described the reverse soldiers as "highly decorated" and operational experience.
The Stabshauptmann built up the flight operations of Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots in his region.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regime, to which the soldiers belong, said: 'If this crew could not avert the crash, nobody would have been able to do it'.
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show that the deployment is dangerous.
But it is also of great importance 'for a country from which we are only separated by two states,' she said.
After the wedding ceremony, the coffins were taken from the Duomo.
When and where they are buried, the Federal Armed Forces did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife.
The Royal House informed this on Thursday.
Traditionally the Danish king couple is attached in the church church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already completed a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, as it was further stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik would be buried, it is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be attached to his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired with the title "Princess".
In Denmark, Henrik did not receive the title and function he wanted, he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, said Lene Balleby, chief spokesman of the Danish royal house.
Where the last retirement of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, it is still unclear.
He does not intend to be attached to his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde Monpezat, son of a French noble family, met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, Prince Henrik had a difficult position with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of virginia tobacco, which had a reputation here for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed..,,.,.,,..,,.
These were two mistakes! '
Prime Minister Weil Will Rapid Reelection
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the land, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday advocated the dissolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her rural group in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country election, the red green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP opposition.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten founded her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
The head of the CDU Group, Björn Thümler, wants to recommend that his group be included.
The CDU and FDP together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Greens would have 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green government must now decide whether it could continue to govern without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil believes it is essential that the Landtag should decide its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide how to proceed on Tuesday.
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that Landtag will deprive the Prime Minister and elect a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These opportunities must be properly examined, "said Thümler.
'You will be discussing all questions if they are legally considered properly. '
Thümler called Twestens step "yet something curios".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good '.
She called herself a black green.
The Greens called on the breakaway MEPs to return their country mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return with immediate effect her country mandate, which she received via the green country list," said Governors Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The chairman of the Green Group, Anja Piel said: 'We very much regret the decision of Elke Twesten'.
She has deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group.
'Even in the light of the absence of any differences in substance, we cannot understand this step '.
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of red green," said the Federal Chief of Social Democrats on Facebook.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s decision to reelect Landtag quickly.
Leaving Twspätestens costs red green in Lower Saxony.
The politician places "in her injured vanity and frustration" her personal interests before the welfare of the country ", criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is scandalous that the CDU is participating in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to capitalize on political capital '.
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU leader, Björn Thümler, wants to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten to distort the result of the election of 2013 with personal careers.
At that time, the CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and answer in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the affected egg charges.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at present, a health risk is practically impossible.
Is Aldi now taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of offer - because the central role of the educator is not really taking the central role of the educator?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my House has acted immediately and since it became known that Germany's concern has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe to health.
If eggs are exceeded the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg, they are not accessible.
Unburdened eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it is not businesses to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production companies are not directly responsible.
Instead, they must expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the event of a serious case.
Is it only a lack of staff, nor the competent competence?
It was the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that it is crucial that it should be properly informed and that it should be transferred to public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the competent authorities to provide full information.
Is regular alert to food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain safe and viable food.
When an insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The appropriated means that manufacturers, traders and consumers into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of insecticides Fipronil in the keeping of food suppliers is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and smoothly.
The impact of football ’ s financial rules on Neymar ’ s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organisation that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million ($262 million) to buy Brazilians out of its treaty, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several $10 million a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make money for Neymar to sign up and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the team ’ s financing by Qatar ’ s energy-rich rulers.
Clubs may spend a lot of money on buying players, but must counteract with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break even point in their soccer business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
Former French player believed that clubs that had borrowed huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruin when banks or owners withdrew support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on club debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP management period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million.
And, while Platini fell into disgrace by the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to advocate discouraging excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the invoicing over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sum of EUR 44.4 million can be identified in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of €60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League to be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by inflating revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income.
That is precisely what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was blown by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments from the organizational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors, and that such a maneuver could easily be found for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
You spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than €10 million in 2015 / 16 million.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising, and boycott sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the State," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports coon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," said Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country. '
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years Chocolat Frey has produced Bord-chocolate for Swiss.
Now there is a possible end to sweet cooperation: the airline is writing the order.
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
Approximately 17 million small red chocolate plates at 14 grams distribute each year to passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros-Tochters generate annual sales of around 1 billion francs.
But the advertising effect is more important: for a shogger manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey seeks to renew the treaty beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate panels on board their flights since 2006.
Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
Two and a half years ago, Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo on the launch of cooperation with..
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with delicacies from Confiserie Sprüngli, Business Class nash passengers Schoggi of Lindt and the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi distributes from Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Dis Olympic Champion Robert Harting achieves World Cup finals
The three times World Champion will fight for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother, Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, failed in the national championship, and was able to look at the debate only from the gallery.
The Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 metres far, qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgia goes to Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective.
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to major things.
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables referred to by H. Jon Benjamin).
By digging into the core of the gag - middle-age actors play horny children who grow up - they managed to get the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the principle of casting, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character looks through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (including Mr. Showalter), now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underlip beard of Singles, whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old crack.
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer.. in. in. in. in. in,..,,,,,,,,,,
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now recalls another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-west ring-fighting iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, suggests to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism.
The main roles - a hard-shot Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags for standing (police spend time watching chess on television, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
Six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which has been edited to a lower length, could provide his Agitprop atire, since Gregor and Iosef continue to visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men, devoting a bunch of Hamburg.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for a joke.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we are even doing it with our own recent history and yours.
Shorting Drug Mafia in
The police have managed to strike the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, were searched for numerous objects, as the prosecutor's office of Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused were arrested between 25 and 77 years old and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
In addition, officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and hundreds of thousands of euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects.
The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.
The action was taken by Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, more than 300 police officers were in operation.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and blackmail..
Since summer 2016, the prosecutor ’ s office has been investigating Constance against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a strong exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo Rottweil investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
As a result, four officials from Palermo were accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
In particular, Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27th in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early morning is likely to go to the band's account.
Greater gaps in the Foreign Register
'Data from citizens who should not appear there ': according to a report, the Foreign Register in Germany has serious shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misjudgments in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government representative for Refugees Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to major gaps in the Foreign Central Register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could be "sometimes serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations ", warned in an analysis presented by the" Süddeutsche Zeitung ".
According to the data, ten million people of foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been maintained sufficiently, the quality of data has not been good.
In individual cases, data of 1921 were found, "of people who have been no longer alive or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register '.
"Miscellaneous data input can slow back processes significantly," says the report continues.
The statistics on people who are subject to travel are also EU citizens who do not need to leave.
However, such false assignments led to a distorted debate on how to deal with those who are travelling to leave, "the analysis says.
Meanwhile, the federal government seems to have begun sending refugee families with under 16 years of age to Italy once they have entered.
This is evident from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is implementing such procedures' concerning families with children - except infants and infants - after 1 June 2017 '.
Since the end of 2014, this has been practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper citing the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the EU State to which they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, this state can send him back to the country of entry.
The office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with under-age children in Italy has increased considerably '.
Italy has made guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke criticized this decision: 'Families with children threaten the shortcomings of the Italian asylum system and the threat to children's welfare'.
The Second Best Result
A total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Oberreichenbach, the blood donation service provided to other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
In particular, Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood at the meeting of the council.
"It is genial how our body is designed for this, and we pay respect to donors who provide their blood to strangers, and to do so," underscored Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the preserves are broken into their constituents.
For example, three people could benefit from blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported about the actions being taken in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK Circuit Leader.
Obviously, the switch to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter donated 500 milliliters of their life juice ten times each.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged as weak economic growth and inflation slowing down have slowed speculation about rising.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it insisted on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure.
Policymakers of the Bank ’ s Monetary Committee (MPC) voted to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking to rise this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017, and 1.6% for 2018, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to curb Brexit inflation, and she said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut-stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to make GBP 15 billion more available under this system - with GBP 115 billion sterling.
minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: 'The MPC ’ s central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on households ’ real incomes continue to strain consumption.'
At interest rates, she repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be required to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The Bank ’ s downward growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31, falling by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision will not be changed after the recent disappointing growth figures have slowed rising expectations for an interest-rate hike, and GDP rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank ’ s end.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight salary increases, as the sharpening first before it improves.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" income collapse in the coming years, but she added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25% last August, following the shocking EU vote, which caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully achieve prices and the economy.
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates, the call for an interest-rate hike had risen, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% last month to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that this was expected and will raise it again in the coming months.
The Bank said that exceeding its 2% target was "entirely" to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders loudly looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals are expiring and closing new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. '
NHS (The National Health Service) is to prescribe a controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
As of September, after a battle in the High Court against funding of the drug in the NHS, patients will have access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment.
NHS England announced that preexposition prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86%, is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP, despite claims that local authorities should finance it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chef Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposition prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in the event of infectious persons..,,,.,,.,,..
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment..,..,.,.......
People who live in England and are registered with a surgeon can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for delivery this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as is targeted, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in progress over three decades in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. '
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP medicine has been obtained, we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. "
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us move closer to ending the spread of HIV in society '.
Living the Great Life: basement and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day '.
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a basement to make the most of the spacious ceiling.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my request, 'she says.
To this end, she commissioned the Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a basement where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on one another without having to join.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but to create steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. '
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine floor, Retrouvius ’ classic copper light window looks down over the glamorous living area.
Refined gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
On both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, divided units offer space for all the glasses and glasses of Joanne.
The beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Closed kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went there," explains Erfan of the steel door, furnated..
'It is counterweight so that when you push the door, it slides very easily. '
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the floor - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
'In a rudimentary form, a real estate broker will enter and carry out a calculation based on land size '.
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall into the electric sockets in the walls.
They are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something quite astonishing, due to its good design and increased square metre number of square meters.
Indeed, like Joanne, you could choose not to leave them.
Broken Battle for $500 million
Two brothers are in dispute four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers are in a dispute over one of Victorias ’ s largest property empire.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate over separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.
The Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller shopping centres.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - describes about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
A court act says that this means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought to be the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, following several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed...
The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetent.
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hope to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in this case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails, and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held by both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwoodland, where Colin opened the family ’ s first jewellery.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "high school in my last years, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.
Both Lukas and Mark, Paul says, "have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin was very restrained even though he was a former AFL member and, after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire ’ s best friend of the television.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by SMS to say 'I really cannot say much', because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute," he said and added that he "still hope for a solution".
Friday this hope seemed over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstention.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do so.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even-handed course.
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that gets into the president ’ s hands.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"When candidate was angry Trump about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage from posts to be persuaded," former election adviser Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don ’ t know - that Trump ’ s tweets would have even more fuel without intervention.
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If his staff were able to keep him away from him, then his efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from generating controversy.
Part of the problem is that, in a White House made up of competing parties always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the advisers' preference to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Recent and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is eager to find out where they come from.
That is exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone mally gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the source behind a bunch of Lecks' in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter, or that he has not offered concrete evidence, or that he has made false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began asking employees about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram Trump receives."
How did this work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
He may prove himself to be a more effective manager than priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still seek influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult.
Europol ’ s most sought criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
The police all over Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the flight this summer.
Since the addresses of the serious criminals sought are not by nature, information is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the 'EU Most Wanted' Advent calendar.
Experience would have shown that many refugees are hiding away from tourist destinations.
21 postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, there has been the www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have been arrested until now, at least eleven of them due to indications after the publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionaires' series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined wardrobes who negotiated a parish tribe drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their rulers.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous road of Solihull called the "Millionaires series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May without being deterred by the Council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have afflicted the Solihull Council, which said that it is' useless to deal with the problem '.
An anonymous resident said: "They went there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones onto the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travellers were there in May, moved forward and are now back.
More came yesterday evening, probably more today. '
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop it. '
An inhabitant who did not want to be called said: 'It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area '.
As one of Solihull ’ s Council spokesman said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road, working with the Solihulls police, and we take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible to report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case '.
From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise
The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to be reopened on 1 March next year..
That is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, approximately 30 000 nights per year were lost and revenue from the spa tax.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered to the Landcouncil office as a gathering accommodation, which gave rise to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial at that time.
But, above all, Freudenstadt ’ s Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interest at the hotel.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star hotel with the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, waste containers have been standing in front of the entrance for some time, and when you enter the house, you will see how extensive renovation works will be done.
The floors were torn out, ceilings were removed, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There is still much to be done before March.
"It is actually a nice hotel", says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed.
Everything should be "nicely close to the citizens", as Thomas Scherer puts himself.
'We want to make a jewel on it '.
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are available.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but Scherer emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise, which has about 60 rooms, wants to be wide, explained Scherer.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable at home.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, says Scherer.
The city ’ s ideas are identical to those of the hotel group.
'We are on the same line '.
When asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise.
Almost under a million euros, he expects.
The exterior installations are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible by the restaurant, which is open.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US Special Advocates Grand Jury
In the Russian affair over US President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is alleged to have appointed a Grand Jury after a report.
The Board has started work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper regarded the move as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
CNN reported that there are already initial charges from the board in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence services have long been accusing the Kremlin of intervening in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican campaign.
Mueller is reportedly investigated more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment.
A few weeks ago, the Washington Post wrote that the Special Adviser had personally put Trump to the center and investigate the allegation of whether the president might have obstructed the judiciary during the affair...
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether to charge charges.
Grand Jurys are also called Chambers of indictments.
They are mostly turned on when they are major and controversial cases.
The process is always behind closed doors.
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite people to interrogation under oath.,.,.,..,,...
According to the CNN channel, charges have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who participated in the meeting were asked to make a statement, as it was stated in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his campaign leader, Paul Manafort, attended the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the installation showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be activated in the end to decide on charges.
Nevertheless, setting up the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russian affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"Russia's history is a complete invention," Trump said.
The issue gives democrats a chance to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about '.
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he did not know about setting up a Grand Jury.
However, they also usually work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Adviser in a 'fair' way..
Former FBI leader James Comey, said three times that the president was not investigated.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed, as the statement continued.
But Mueller had been deployed only after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this outrage, Trump had allegations of wanting to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey said to a Senate committee in June that Trump asked him to suspend the investigation of the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the Special Counsel and his staff.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional congressional, such as the Watergate affair surrounding later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the request of the president.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators put forward proposals on Thursday that the Special Adviser could no longer be dismissed easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has dissolved itself from the nearly seven times the size of Berlin.
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research informed this on Wednesday.
The coloss of over 1 trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres now drive north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
It is one of the biggest icebergs that researchers have registered over the past three decades, with 175 kilometres of length.
It does not pose a threat to people..,,.,.,, to..,
According to research reports, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg.
In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact-background.
Many researchers believe that this could be linked to global warming.
The now broken coloss has been part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
As a result, it grows ever further and breaks down regularly.
Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this barrel, the balance of growth and breakdown a few years ago.
A complete barefoot has fallen there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot of talk in favour of the Larsen-C Schelfeis, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks at a key point.
Melting Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea levels because they swim on the water and displaces ice as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the barrel will lead the glaciers to the sea and flow much faster than before.
This may increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctica research project (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest slab in Antarctic, with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
On the transition from mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge of the open ocean.
There it regularly breaks down there..
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now entering a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.
"This is the widest retreat since the record began," he also confirmed.
There is controversy among scientists whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will grow again or decline in the long term and possibly coincide, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: 'Our models say that it will be less stable'.
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many icebergs of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades.
This long tap of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
Temperature increases have contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature rises fastest.
CDU wants Housing Tariff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU calls to leave the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer recess, the circle passed 41 new posts in administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now, 17 trainees have once again lost their first day of work.
Teachers at the circle are obviously very desirable.
Approximately 620 applications were recorded for the places to be placed this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 vacancies at the Mettmann circle.
Among other things, doctors, engineers and engineers, as well as general administration.
The CDU wants to take the initiative in the circle day together with the FDP and the UWG in order to counter the shortage of skilled workers in administration.
According to the parties' wishes, the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development '.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals, but also to counteract the shortage of candidates for the future.
The overall concept should be oriented both internally and externally, identify concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle is dealing with personnel problems that were not previously known.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of genuine 'competition among public employers'.
In addition, there is a large number of employees who leave the service of illness or age.
So the maximum time for action, so that no more jobs are left.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently brought a dip surprise in the circle day, when he publicly questioned the staffing costs and stuffed the other parties.
People want to see all the possibilities that will allow the withdrawal of the communal employers' association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the neighbouring cities - should seek a house tariff," people say.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the collective bargaining system for public service.
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money only if you change to a higher level based on professional years.
But the circle ’ s tasks have increased in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, in which employees would take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, the Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy Strengthening the NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean have warned that they cannot continue unless they abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minni ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German Youth Savet, because their team had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in ways that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed charges by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we are unable to operate in the search and rescue zone", said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
'We cannot judge all the accusations that are being made at the moment after we have gathered all the information and can judge the situation '.
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the boat of Youth Savet, the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew will take howboat migrants, delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that smugglers can leave so that ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting was supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring any 'major changes or obstacles' of their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate Organization is Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Minniti now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors has borne fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger, and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rising and Trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly Guides were available for this purpose..
Accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Burg- and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim during hot summer temperatures.
Views followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there have been longer increases, for which long trials rewarded.
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, vantage point was ripped at vantage point, connected by "flowing" trials and moderate increases.
On the last two days a lot of altitude had been called again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and caves brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, bikers breathed healing salvation in the open-air inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also fired.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is preparing for e-sport
Are sports starters in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting over the stadium grass in wind and weather?
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages.
This was also recognised by the first Bundesliga to become increasingly involved in this area.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, and later FC Schalke 04 followed, and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB", says executive Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that there are many clubs on this train ".
Next weekend, FIFA in London will host the first Interactive Club World Cup, where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year-olds that young people still go into the stadium", says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present online much more often than to send the Bundesliga to Asia once a year.
What exactly is this about?
In e-sport, computer games such as League Of Legends, Dota 2, Counterstrike or even FIFA football simulation.
As in normal sport, leagues have long established themselves in which professionals compete against each other.
And e-sport is already part of the official program in 2022 Asia games.
But is it really a sport?
For many, the idea is certainly needed to get used.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - such as increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid response capability.
Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.
'The fitte player is a good player. '
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming increasingly a topic".
Controls are difficult to implement in online games, and in the scene lacked the structures of classical sport.
The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are travelling internationally, this is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.
In 2016, €50 million was invested in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship, and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
This is little against the $2.4 billion of the football Bundesliga.
However, e-sport is not far away from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "the Deloitte advisers.
Internationally, many countries are already on.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where former baseball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez join the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actress Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
Something is happening in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school e-sport was introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, football first-league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB Executive Board Röttgermann.
It is no longer enough to fall into nostalgia and to conceal old times is no longer enough.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time, to align the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world", says Dutt.
'We cannot insist that only in football, everything remains as it has always been. '
Poison eggs - The egg alternatives to Cooking and Baking
The toxic eggs scandal has now hit almost all federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and took all eggs out of sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs should be taken on the shelves which are demonstrably not containing fipronil.
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts urging Conrad Roy to suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of sentencing behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was convicted in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: 'My family is inexorable.
My son was my best friend. '
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse, Carter stood with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convicted.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor said to the court.
"She finished his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility, "she said.
'She has not shown any repentance '.
But Carter's lawyer said that it was a 'terrible circumstance that she completely regret'.
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that their 'age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions'.
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, saying that there is' no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything; I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will bear for eternity, "it says.
Roy ’ s sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "persecuted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having this single person I have been working with since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, spring from a building, I do not know there are many ways," she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: 'You must do it, Conrad' and 'Everything you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy'.
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit by some press.
The case shared legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British fellow resident in Italy, before being released two years ago.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: 'Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison'.
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the New Mini-Lahm of the FC Bayern
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup.
The FC Bayern has a great season for the Confed-Cup winner - no extra motivation is hurting.
Something was different on his seat in the cabin, Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra piece of clothing was very small.
But since there was no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer on the second day of the Audi Cup, he did not see Manuel Neuer.
"The coach did not announce it," the Confed-Cup-winner after his first bet as a Bayern-Kapitän.
Well, it could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also interpret Kimmich.
It was not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as a player leader in the C-Elf, made up of youth players, debutants and especially from the holiday season.
If you prefer to distribute sugar to those who have a lot of confidence that you want to keep in a mood.
So those who have been chosen to follow the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old was flying over the field as a mini-lamp.
Right behind, this is his position, the white bind on the arm did the rest.
And Kimmich worked in this starting formation formation like the one who can take the helm in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unheard force.
He looked at the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (barely worked); Renato Sanches was able to connect to the performance of the Asian trip (even if it did); and Sebastian Rudy and Nikla ’ s sweet not to be negative in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot.
After all, that worked very well.
After his death, Rudy ran out of defence, both acted sovereign.
The famous Napoli Storm was often difficult, and also sweet tried to succeed in playing a couple of times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was' not the way we hoped for '.
But he, too, showed a good performance in the debut.
Game shifting, tempo change: "For this style I was taken".
How unfamiliar this Bavarian world is still for the newcomers was seen after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich passed on to his new fellow players after a few.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is happening here.
At Bavaria you simply have to win every game ".
After all, he does not need to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB Women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB Women
Austria ’ s most famous soccer, spoke out on Twitter just before the match and wanted the ÖFB ladies well.
The Bayern-Legionär is almost a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fevering with our Ladys.
The tweet of the Austrian soccer of the year and Champions-League-winner should be a special motivational injection.
Perhaps our ladies could need the famous Bavarian Dusel.
Business satisfaction with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economics praises Wissings Tempo
It was often irreconcilable that the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and businesses from the region speak to T V demand of a change in economic policy - while simultaneously denouncing the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
NATO ’ s biggest U-turn sees NATO in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure for planning to be established by 2021.
The West circumvention of Trier, which is the primary requirement of the federal transport route plan.
The goal is to start the route in December 2020, says Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a guide to support regional but internationally competing companies.
As Wissing suggested by Wissing, the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier aspires to a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which has been depressed for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear to people who want to start their own company.
The craftsmanship Chamber Trier sees a new incentive for young trainees, says CEO Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 Euro for the completed master-exam and 2500 Euro if graduates become self-employed within ten years of their master training.
The homework list for the country remains long.
Facts of the planned road construction, but at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Managing Director of IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to stop mobility in the country, only 29 posts have been filled up.
The IHK calls for more orders to external offices.
Christian Baldauf points to the Court of Auditors ’ calculations that the country invests more than EUR 20 million in 2017 and 2018 million less in the ’.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also humiliating for broadband in the country so far.
In 2016, regional companies evaluated net supply only with a note 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about declining Internet connections and declines.
Ex Economic Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is now out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of the Pro Wind Power Company.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private college in Karlsruhe - where after four months of disagreements, she already cleared the field of disagreements.
Audi is to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a backlash.
One day before Audi ’ s announcement, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that 'there are smarter options than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based, to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a callback.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralize exhaust gases from diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen ’ s mistakes, which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested but are reduced in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been accused and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States has been extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
That Message ’ s Floss on the Isar of Saturday
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to ensure that the visitors of Isar visitors also participate, there will be a floss through Munich, which has a special message.
When it comes to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large flow between Flaucher and Reichenbach Bridge.
And this is not a normal flow, with Isar tourists.
But the building reference will be made to the building reference.
On the floss you can see a large Infotransparent.
It shows a rubbish mountain.
The start of a public awareness campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
The motto "True Love is..." is... "aims to increase understanding for the Isar as a wildlife that is worth protecting..,,,,,,.,,..
Last summer, the flow went over the Isar and again this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a respectable and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo ’ s Knolls and the Laughter of Sac...,........
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most widely published cartoon cartoons, the cartoons of his characters are his trademark.
Also with 85, the Argentine is still working on a film.
His message: laughter, 'because there is too much suffering in the world'.
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on 4 August 1932.
In the first years as an artist, he beat himself as a drawing for congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he achieved a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match and then in the Stern and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again the artists of cities were inspired.
Large, round Mordillo figures fall in drawings with the leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
According to his own data, he is still sitting on the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
With calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, pluzzles and watches, his drollings and watches.
For six years he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.,.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a Giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D movie, which is supposed to be on the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he relies on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
Climate Change of Lavender from Provence
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender has decreased due to drought conditions and diseases transmitting insects, causing great headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them '.
There is a lot at stake.
Lavendelöl attracts not only for holidaymakers but also for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long vegetable tubes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil '.
The solutions to be considered include better distribution of water and the slowing of soil evaporation, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringia Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary.
This Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Crabs, ignitions, merchants, vaginers or a Landsknechtslager should be seen in the city centre on these days.
The Killing of a journalist highlights Mexico ’ s growing Threat
Workers of the Riodoce weekly meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials, and continuous drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children in office, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and belly feeling.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's pay list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico's chaos dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and as the bodies are mounting, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 following attacks and threats under federal protection, and so far, there have been at least seven deaths this year in seven states.
Among the latter is the editor and inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt even though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on Protection of Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists ’ murderers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they are still insisting on treating Sinaloa violence, even though they are unruly and even though the terrain is still more traitive.
Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
'As long as we do not know why, we distrust everyone '.
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the provincial capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the newspaper's name - translated as "Twelve River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it near.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But there is virtually nothing but silence on Valdez.
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields, with rival factions fighting to fill the vacuum.
There is nothing that every day in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the streets every day, or that the cemetery is full of ornamented two-story maoles for drug kings, larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for one minute that there is a state of calm when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has been broken with the blame for not protecting his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman ’ s sons.
This release may have annoyed the sons, presumed Gangmite members bought each copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 U.S. dollars.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to conduct journalism without encountering the drugs problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish tough investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious Maria-Moors Cabot Prize for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either you play the stupid.
I do not want to be asked: 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why did you not say what was happening?'
The Riodoce team missing Valdez, the funny bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with envelopes and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: was his love of routine his desolation?
His death, too, forced them to question her own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"You don't like you to deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The anger, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, is that 'smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the matter has happened with Javier'.
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce workers met for security training, no mobile phones were suddenly allowed; days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside two policemen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan.
Half in joke, some reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50% of policemen that the governor himself described as untrusted.
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are effectively under control.
For this week, Riodoce has clicked on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending focused on the governor ’ s home town.
And there was a group that carried out abduction in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor ’ s office.
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of El Chapo Guzman escaped a military attack.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have seen the Valdez column as the best informed source of the abduction.
"Previously we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken. '
The Valdez office has been transformed into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the staff have become something they never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to the prosecutor ’ s office.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez had been killed.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing down the streets and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, the director Bojorquez is leaving Washington, trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spiying and killing journalists for telling them the truth.
Since then, she has asked for it to be reconsidered by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organised crime, government officials involved, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket of organized crime.
The media guardian group "Articulo 19" has allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel: 'Here I am because of my reports'.
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to her separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed publicly to the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page, entitled 'What do you want of us?'
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as seems to photograph Ruben Espinosa, who, together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking is frightening him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was finished, Riodoce's editors were sitting on the doorstep in front of the office and dragging beer when all their phones started to sum up.
A series of shootings with bandenrivales and security forces near Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued escalated, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the Bordstein edge you have published the news on the website of Riodoce about mobile phones.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirenen were up near - another shooting facility in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who kept guards to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they did not show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible throughout Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his traces.
'How can you even think about this, 'Bojorquez said,' when, on the same day that Javier was murdered, the internees asked me to send them to the streets for reporting. '
Dinosaurier used camouflage to evade his enemies.
At first glance it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so good that they could even find that his scant skin was a red brown - and they said that she had something of a "restless past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described it as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier that lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as' truly remarkable '.
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored heresy is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
He discovered that he was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years on uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth clutch.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little with your eyes, you might almost think it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible.
'It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaur. '
Researchers have found that, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, it is probably threatened with meat eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predatory animals and used a shielding technique known as countershading used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed us to interfere better with its enemies, experts say, suggesting that larger dinosaurs threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million years old Nodosaurier family made headlines in May for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours in uncovering it.
The astonishing conservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the counterbalance is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today's animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution helped conceal confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals using countershading hawning, cebras, or belts - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predatory behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence of his life, including its preserved intestines, to find out what it eaten as his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, was torn into a river and pushed into the sea, where he fell on his back to the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to be much more widespread nationally than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with conserved scattering skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost exactly exactly the same as it was in the early chalk time.
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you look a little, you might almost believe that it is sleeping '.
The chalk period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his dreadful ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long six tons of heavy monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sinking in the sea after death and mumified in the mummy.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snake to hip.
The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch peaks that stood on its shoulders.
Researchers believe that the armored heresman was swamped by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.
The hidden remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin remains cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is rare as a win in the lotto.
The more I see it, the more confusing it.

In the Storm: Mass Carambolage on A8: Many injured injured.
A huge accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are many injured, kilometres of congestion and suitcases.
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) motorway (A8) on late Thursday afternoon in a mass carambolage.
According to the first police data, around 5 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg), almost 30 vehicles, including probably lorries, were transported..
The exact number of injured persons were initially unreported.
This is about light to medium serious injuries, said a police officer.
A large number of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometre long backlog was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were massive obstacles on the opposite side of the road - due to numerous passengers.
The fire brigade took note of the hallmarks of the vehicle steers, which now face severe penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45, there was another accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests' Comfort Check-in '' Comfort Check-in ''
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.
Or you are deepened into your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
When the creator comes and awakens an ungently or tear the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the time of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the ruthless ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket.
Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.
"If the offer increases, we extend it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a railway speaker.
"Comfort check-in" is the train card depreciation without a driver.
In order to be able to use these, however, a number of requirements must be met: a smartphone or tablet.
You must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
You must also buy it via the App of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because "Comfort check-in" works like this: you get up to the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation appears in the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passengers X is in the train and took the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant is in place Y during the ticket control, he knows that a passenger with already depreciated online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working and keep quiet.
Check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for rail - which in turn should be used by passengers.
"If you want to travel with our train staff without ticket control, simply check in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often travel on the train will know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the greatest annoyance.
Often, you do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or a document that needs to be presented.
The result is endless discussions between train attendees and passengers, resulting in poor mood in the abstentions or large areas and delays in controlling their own ticket and, in the end, takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further numbers on the same track are not yet activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the one in St. Louis Geborene, on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled through a post from a High School.
'The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street ', it was said.
Confused because nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweed on her timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis area was tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He postulated an image of Brown ’ s vibrant body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That is wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on Canfield-drive.,,,,,,,,,,, and,,,,,,,.,,,,,
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who wrote a sign that "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellending dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman escaped his gun and shouted: 'I will kill you all'.
"This is not customary," Ferrell recalled her statement.
'This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical '.
At this moment I felt chilling.
I was angry and crying. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the next morning to Ferguson.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people living in the Community and filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell travelled to Ferguson, who had a flower dress and a matching crown, the two talked about a conversation that they had on the black experience and the black state ".
"You remember how I taught you, when black people must fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I could not take her with, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
It must know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to be free to free ourselves.
Although I have the good fortune to give her experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black female child.
I have the feeling that I would do her a disservice to keep them away from it. '
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.
Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. '
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell: 'Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?'
This skepticism was fueled by innumerable cases by people, often white, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan said recently in an interview, 'We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centralise their votes and we wanted to do it differently.'
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death tractor..,,,.,,.,.,. in.
Ferrell's commitment brought the project closer, together with six other locals followed the team of Whose Streets? ” in the years after Brown ’ s shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us.
'This was the main thing for me is how these people are presented, because that is how I will be presented. '
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell ’ s experience - to show that the movement was not a Messias leader, but a community that meets, "Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents of Whose Streets? "show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and married her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
'But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people. '
In addition, Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.
Black gay women must bear the brunt of everything '.
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who shattered this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel your energy through the screen. '
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is suspended for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the region, which she calls her home: "A chaos".
However, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains'.
From "Dream" to "Size": TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.
The topic is scarcely enough.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some people say to the Bit-Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Do not need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Whom Wacken!" (Lars Schol)..,,,,,.,,,,,
While supporters rely on a gallery to attract more customers into the city, as well as the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will blew out.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the plot on which the farm hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will stop at the beginning of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farm store for many years.
Our eggs, as well as the delicious cakes of rural women are always happy.
We also discovered the butcher for us.
We would like to have an opportunity to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
There are other cities.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is particularly interesting '.
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery, it is up to the height of the rental.
This is probably not very low in the new project. '
Eva Kilic: "What shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets, I find this unnecessary.
There is enough of this in our city.
We can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least we retain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there is fresh, most of them directly from the producer and is also cheap.
As you can see, shops are rented only by larger companies, because the rents are often unsustainable for a retailer.
It is a pity that there are almost no more specialist shops and what is left of them will probably disappear '.
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farmer market hall go back during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes.
Or does the ghost Bit Gallery manage to drive all shops from Bitburg? "
George Marquet: "This simply won't work.
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farm market rather than this gallery.
But there is no longer any room for a farm market hall thanks to the insane many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farm hall is broken down, a piece of culture will disappear. '
A similarity: Artist Creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticed - that hang on cables on the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from chelsea and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the sections from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst provided a 35 year sentence after making public secret secret of the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he was only three days.
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways to interpret and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six infringements of the spy law, computer fraud, and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photograph - a gray, black and white selfie in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette mutes and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so contact Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letters friends who exchange several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would transform and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
Indeed, only days after the book was published that Mannings would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informers from the government camp and transgender troops to find new tweet ways to unleash the rigid divisions that he should fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that 'things happen for a particular reason'.
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with its oversized signature (the "i" in her surname has a heart) called for an end to the 'automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture'.
On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence - one thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
'DNA data can tell so many different stories, so they are 30 of these stories'.
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in its own space, is a page from the comic novelty mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears in her hand from the disciplinary disciplines of the United States like King song.
'When they cold your speech, they won ',' it says.
'So never stop the mouth '.
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
'I still get goose when I talk about it '.
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was foreseen in the comic book - but if she should do it, it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the space, by her own genomic simulacs, which clash like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Mannings stature), where their genetic haploggroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
'I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation. '
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University of Oxford for Killing Killing
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are being sought as suspects after a man had been smoked with deadly injuries in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued for murders for alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as evidenced by the acts of the Cook County Court..
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority says that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officials received a call, arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead in the scene, and detective investigating the stitches as murder, while the police actively searches for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been on a par and has been excluded from entering Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A university spokesman and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that 'we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way.'
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Service, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he urges suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place, and our efforts to locate them intensify," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional, and national authorities help find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building owner of the Grand-Plaza building who had just received a mysterious tip, saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi.
The management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to residents: 'The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.'
'We will conclude the WADA Roadmap in the near future '- Russian Vice-President Mutko
Russian Vice Premier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to restore Russia ’ s Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of compliance with the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap on compliance with the code describing the criteria for reinstating RUSADA and recently published on the organization ’ s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA's investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
On the matter, Mutko said: "We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist '.
Mutko ’ s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
At the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally, "said Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to Moscow's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" in order to be reinstated.
Aldi sells no longer sells eggs for............
This was shared by the corporate groups.
It is a mere precaution that no health impairment could continue to be considered in the communication.
From now on, only eggs will be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven negatively tested on fipronel-containing anti-lamps.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or, worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not feel the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She has called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaints hotlines to employees, and in some cases, whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to monitor their health, but where is the fit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees.
Errett said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a company Hitze card that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can follow why.
Businesses come to realize that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation, and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up convercent, which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw a growing interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent companies can send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and look at the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behaviour.
And when the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, worker turnover, and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters.
Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, to submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often intimidation and inconvenient experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
'And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation. '
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took for the "Social media to come to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that receives the agreement of Venture Capital investors, who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.
Glitzers secured $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and brought all its funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
There is a growing research research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well, and companies run well when employees are engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
Data on employee involvement in the workplace culture experts is important.
But the data is useless if a company managers do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Kotter International Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data.
"For if you do not follow employees will ask," Have you really heard me?
Are you concerned about this?
And whom you do not care about, why should I? '
Madison Reed, who now performs monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights about employees and hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better bond between employees in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
There is a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the team's new training fields on the campus.
Some have pulled out their jerseys and show their back full sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6: 30 a.m. the next morning..
"This is a real tretmill for the next three days," said Bruinstrainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until Friday's final.
Therefore, the first three UCLA training courses should start at 7: 15 to meet the players already packed schedule.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and carried out practical exercises during the summer school in Mora.
They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August, 20 before the start of formal game preparation for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the NCAA regulatory change, even if it adds another point to the players ’ busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they continue, they are great people.
I think that as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great '.
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task, given the clear lines of its fields, from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a top-class hotel that has already been fostered with footballs that placed a protective net behind a gate.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room and then prepared to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape from an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I do not worry too much.
We have a plan '.
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against fake news.
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reviews from third parties, and then show their results under the original post, said Thursday's largest online social network in the world.
In an opinion on its website, the company said that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify potential false messages and send them to fact-auditors who may display results from the fact-checking results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe have influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has become a major political issue in Europe, too, with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings, as they did before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-review review would be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to knowing which stories are challenged by third-party auditors, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature of the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a Comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes, a mophaaric Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I think it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says weathering.
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand '.
'A Castle in England 'covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I reacted only to the fingerprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his fingerprint!
And letters always smell for smoke, because at the time, a fire was fired because of light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were there.
Oh, I love archives! '
For someone who has been beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I have overvalued my welcome,") this seems all too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browse through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hy creatures on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He travelled through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape enthusiasts, gardeners and sometimes with artists working on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he dragged "whiskey and began to write".
Scotney's intimate story is relatively unknown, because the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees only began to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years of Aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the roof. "
diaries, letters from the English empire, maps showing who possessed what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch for the two families fought.
Young, let everything go! '
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in English history, including 'The Labourer', following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 1381.
"There is a record of a revolt that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start.
Perhaps the two are linked? '
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron who the Darrell family hidden during the English Reformation for seven years.
Or 'The Smuggler', depicting the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin of stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite a pale, keep debt and spend money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys, with a talent to promote heirs. "
After the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences..
He took a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early twentieth-century sanatoriums, which has since been recalled by nature.
However, Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like 'Oh, now I have to deal with the damned life'.
Campaign launched: More than 300 years old Marienkelle in Rhöndorf.
On Friday, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Thursday's round).
Until Thursday, mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Or? ", the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't think this (of course!), they write on their website that was released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that as Bad Honnefer, we citizens know about the beauty and attractiveness of our city. '
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it says..
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique feature".
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef is worth its new roof brand and campaign campaign.
Military Reform in Turkey - Erdogan of the Army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and promotions in Ankara.
This week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the office of the prime minister.
The five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, Justice and External Affairs took part in the discussions.
Thus, the YAS civilians were in the majority.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
General Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the army ’ s commanders, the Air Force, and the Navy were removed.
Since the failed coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired in 169 of the 326 generals and admirals since the failed coup..
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army, mostly because of alleged connections to the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the drafter of the coup attempt.
There have been negotiations in Ankara since this week against 486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the overthrow as a "gift of God," giving him the opportunity to "clean up" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really hold the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper Hürriyet published an article entitled 'Unease in the Military Headquarters'.
In the General Staff, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, the lifting of the ban on female soldiers.
In any case, the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered another 7395 official officials fire, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were earlier seen as the real masters of the country.
Three times, they cleaned up their role as guardian of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power, not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reform requirements.
Former officers say that Erdogan has been targeted at Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine 'Vocal Europe', a name not named officer who, after the attempted coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be 'full of extremists and salafists' in a few years' time.
If so, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, after the clean-up, there are doubts about the Turkish army's willingness to act.
The leadership structures and operational skills are "weakened," Nato diplomats.
Washington Changes the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the green card, said President Donald Trump, cited by the media.
It proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
'This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars on taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way in which green cards are spent to citizens from other countries. '
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, cited by the American media.
Ministry wants to rehabilitate the track for Racing Huttle
Over the past few months, the future of the racing huttles has been repeatedly fought over the past months - now it is going to be very fast.
Before the end of the year, the road on which the tourist railway runs will be built.
In order to secure the future of the racing huttle, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work will begin this year.
"With the decision to continue to order and repair the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, especially important for tourism," said Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the route at around EUR 2.5 million.
The country takes 75% of this sum.
The contract on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country in future, is finally voted, declared Sühl.
The Ministry and Südthuringia Railway as operator, have already agreed on the technical details.
"In this way, the vehicles used and quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for eleven years.
This was intended to order the racing shuttle on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations, especially popular with tourists..
In recent months, a pilot operation has been tested whether the route is being used by sufficient many people to re-order it regularily in the future.
The route is also very rugged in parts.
The Rising of Sex-Robots is real, and we should be worried.
Just when you thought it could not become more crazy in 2017, a new report is coming on technological developments in sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex-robots are a big thing at the moment.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest and the type of fingernails.
'People make fun about them, but companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often, "said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the chest or the color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more worrying, because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford-woman look progressive.
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as humidity.
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-Robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah, which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality," blows up the website of True Companion.
So she likes whatever you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods over the day - just like real people!
It can be tired, fixed on conversation, or it can be 'in mood'! '
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape when you go a move to Frigid (i.e., reluctant) Farrah, are most disturbing.
On his website True Companion compared Roxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and growing refinement indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its growing popularity, they remain temporarily on the margins of consumer culture.
But what leaks out of the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market allows them to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are appearing at a time when women ’ s rights worldwide are under threat, when there is a president in the White House who has irritated with sexually assaulting women.
The most deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not graphic images, the winding bodies and eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities", the robots are not real women.
You cannot separate yourself from your pet or simply walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjection.
In other words, they are good slaves.
Or, to put it in the 2017 speech: officials
Trump ’ s Great Performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense
It has become a truthfulness of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small families.
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival, there were newspapers in the US about how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s electing relatives.
We are all supposedly striving to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less noted is Trump ’ s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousine, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, anyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with whom she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the daunting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the dreadful possibility that his mockers will no longer be stifle off us.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes ” right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of wisdom compared to his standards.
Today, I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urcomic version of the madman – the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return was) - both of which, in fact, are a very mild crime compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the Republican next candidate must be mentally healthy to qualify for an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousine was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of New York carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you do not need a cafe.
The horses are huge, fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scary and the animals twist to look at their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not entirely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage,..
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as two two-year old, an 11-year-old and two women can go to it in the 40's and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full number of points, but fortunately nobody asked about it.
On the other hand, I was forced in a department this week to evaluate my "experience" of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could cross my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the shop.
This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is needed.
The poor woman in the department shop stood apologically grinding, while I had tired the experience of extending my five star credit card to her.
Oscar Pistorius from prison to hospital
Pistorius left prison for a second time.
Last year, he was brought to the hospital for treating cuts in his hands, which according to the prison authorities he suffered after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that his girlfriend was a night invader who hid in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law enforcement authority said that it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the four clandestines were made redundant from Fützen and Epfenhofen.
Three of the dismissal students will go to the secondary school, four to primary school.
On Tuesday evening, the school leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in Biesental in Epfenhofen.
The 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grew up in the chickens, but who is then released into freedom.
In addition, the cheerful Schar introduced a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it erupt from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken cow, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning him into a chicken collapsed, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain mountain and declined..,,,, and.,,.,,.,. in.
After that, the classes three and four showed chickens in Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gockles who threw cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said Schulleiterin Angelika Sitte.
The boy is different from the other boys (chicks), but it belongs to them.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His provision is to be free.
She wanted every four-drummer to feel at home in his new school.
I would like to thank my fellow Members, former schoolmaster, Michael Müller, who is constantly jumping at school bottlenecks, and the parents' representatives.
The chicken age is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She is reluctant to leave her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, they were able to rely on the four-knobs.
At the end, all students recorded a song of summertime and holiday time.
The children were delighted.
For the new school year there are already eight first competitions.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campings in Greece, informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited by television.
On the morning of 1 August the police arrested a group of illegal detention, including the two Bulgarians.
The same day they were released while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened up control of free campings and are imposing considerable fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software Update for diesel vehicles: What stakeholders need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and, in part, Euro 6.,,.,,,,,,.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt from this.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have thrust software," says Anja Smetanin.
The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (KBA) has ordered its retrofitting.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced that it will be implemented quickly in the coming months, but have not yet specified a precise date.
Daimler announced that it will sign any person concerned.
If an inspection is due in any case, it will be done within its framework.
How long should the changes take place in general?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on manufacturers' commitment and political pressure.
'Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the environment. '
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
Probably foreign producers would follow, Smetanin said.
Is there a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
ACE fears that.
But precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas, there have been no loss of value for older diesel.
ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
President Trump ’ s first award ceremony promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be given at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a welcome and join his wife Melania.
Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, announced that it would not participate in the gala.
He said to the New York Times: 'This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of resources - and this is a burden on me'.
59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy Centre, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We Making the City Living Value
Roland Wacker, Haslach ’ s city builder, retires next year.
The job is already advertised - but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work still makes him great fun as he conveys in the press.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application fulfils the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible time.
This means that there is still enough time to be taken into account, taking account of the regular termination periods..
Since Haslach acts as a subcontractor for the administrative community, the applicant must provide appropriate qualifications.
The city certainly wants to retain this function.
If they were no longer able to fill them, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the people is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years, a number of important projects have accumulated, which Wacker has been proud.
"We make the city alive", he is sure about the building office and its employees.
In the future, however, varied projects will continue to be on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have begun.
The Kinzigbrücke bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium is still a topic.
The latter alone will beat about EUR 1.5 million if we do it right, "says Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun '.
There is a lot of room for a city builder.
Haslach ’ s own farm and gardening can respond to a lot more flexibly.
"You can move a lot", says Wacker, and the design of green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is considered to be a monument protection, it is important to have an eye for what fits "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city builder has a great responsibility.
He is a builder, "at the end everything is going over my table".
He can count on long-standing employees in care and coordination: Markus Neumaier (building) has been present for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to remain a long time, Wacker: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place".
Continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you wish to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to have completed studies as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor with a degree of architecture and a degree of expertise in the field of construction and planning law.
The City Construction Office is subject to high construction and civil engineering, construction management of urban properties, urban property management, municipal administration with a building and municipal garden, as well as the sub-building law and the building authority including monument protection.
Bible on wires: South railway line is locked
According to the police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway track in the area of Leobener Straße (B116)..,,,,,,,,,,, and.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These were damaged so badly that the freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators depart from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the Tatort, there were witnesses a rosaro scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a lausbub empire", said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch on APA.
The perpetrators or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put rail traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotives and the facility, the delay and the cost of rail replacement transport, there could be some pairs of railway customers.
Overall, a "significant" sum, the "..
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, while rail traffic on the southern railway route could be carried without any obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains had been on Friday morning, two of them concerned long-distance transport.
Goods were not out, but they were late.
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The incurable state of around 1.3 million in the US, and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach pumps and leaves, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues.
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation, it can result in inflammatory dermatitis.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance immuncell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in its inputs.
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance.
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in Tryptophan should promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal intestinal intestinal intestine if the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immuncell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study girls had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was housed separately.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestines of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice ’ s dams were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them from mice..,,,.,,.,,...,.
mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal robiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were born.
In order to understand how bacteria worked on the immune system, researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid, and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan-metabolism known as Indol 3 milk acid.
If researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when the Tryptophane levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as mice, but defects in genes related to Tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory dermatitis.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophanvalues can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic 'genius'
In Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea ’ s 40 million pounds signed with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game, before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues Preparatory Asian tour, leaving only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season.
"He takes time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later '.
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the association", he added.
'I will be happier when they get four out of four for me, but they have made a great effort. '
Boeing "Malt" Dreamliner in heaven
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky..
The pilots fled from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in US State Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner over the US, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
It was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky.
New Death for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem.
As the wind turns out: when Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, socialist prime ministers always looked at Berlin with some concern.
There is no opposition fires from the party headquarters, only no headwinds from the federal state - that is the campaign ’ s main wish.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed radically.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-House employees have been watching events in the SPD-governed provincial capitals.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds.
These were deep strikes.
That is one by one.
After the surprising end of the red green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red Green can simply not govern reliably," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising exit from a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and the FDP opposition.
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Dutch Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return their mandate, "said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"That should not be true", shouts a SPD campaigner when the new Hiobsmessage reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, will be there without his own majority of government after the transfer of the Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly marked defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the comrades at the time.
After the regional elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It then became - and it became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel led the SPD, and the Dusseldorf collapsed the party smoothly.
In the weeks afterwards, the comrades reared again.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him the next downturn came.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus this weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because, after that, in crisis communication, he made pretty much wrong.
Since then Scholz has struggled for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust affair and his role in the supervisory board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time.
Miese poll ratings were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because in recent weeks, because in recent weeks, it has been increasingly trying to set accents in the federal state.
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to increase his power in Berlin was not concealed in the context of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to grant him because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the opposite may happen.
Because the partisan dispute of the Lower Saxony Greens is not really responsible.
And Schulz certainly not.
For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and especially on the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Bundestag group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the national list of the Lower Saxony Greens.
The logical consequence would be that it return its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag group, laments an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The will of voters four years ago was clear: People made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate to the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal careers of a future CDU parliamentarian will distort the election result," Oppermann said.
He asked for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether more has been there or there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony.
Funding for Local Core III
If you want to rebuild your house, you can soon receive support from the country.
On Wednesday, the mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG City Development representatives informed about this on Wednesday.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in reception.
At that time, in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is important to promote internal development too, and not just to open new building areas.
On 4 April, the Governor Karlsruhe received the information that there would be a recovery area III.
The amount of support was EUR 833 333 333, of which would be EUR 500 000 from the country and the rest of the community.
How does a rehabilitation area be created?
Schindler said, one will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial borders could then be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday.
Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme "Social City", in which the rehabilitation would be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of urban cities, improving housing and working conditions and maintaining and developing infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out objectively, that is, per plot.
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as the Statute.
The eligibility period for the funding has been pending until 30 April 2026.
By September of this year, however, the stocktaking will be carried out in which those involved in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, the adoption of the Statute should be adopted so that the remedies can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the previous preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing urban problems and deciding when to redress and to what extent.
A restoration notice will be added in the land registry for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come to reception again and take a picture of the situation, promised her.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and property sheet", which deals among other things, the construction condition and the restoration plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing sheet", information on the size, distribution and residents of a living room can be provided.
The blue "operating sheet" must be filled only if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.
Moreover, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of aid works according to the 'greyhound principle' - first first first first.
You cannot 'reserve' funds for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make those present a restoration "tasty".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get home and car with a hand movement in hand.
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and point-finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cats and dogs, and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the palaces in houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an extra £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed technology both at home and at his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House ’ s Advertising Costs Thousands
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlighted American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the military provided to TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the heart of the event in the White House on 17 July with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and White House senior officials made a tour through products from all 50 countries.
The Connecticut helicopter was exhibited alongside a Maine, a Wisconsin fire-fighter car and a Mississippi forklift truck.
The White House Military Office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," said the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors, the Deputy Naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 in the morning, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second team would be required to return flight due to the restriction of hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit security staff remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
It was not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the rule.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," commander wrote.
"Sounds as if you are closed," the Deputy commander replied.
The “Made in America ” event has been designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave impetus to the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he advocated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But to request their use only for a photo surgeon is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential plane performed taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential aircraft.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show" Made In America "- which shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters.
HMX 1 crews often carry out training flights in the Washington and South Lawn to put US President in the White House.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 ran 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted the flight crew for the month, a civil servant said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for non-presidential support missions.
The White House said that taxpayers did not accept the burden on any of the other quisitions presented at the event.
One Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not hold budget drawings for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly rates of the US Defense Department for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24380 per hour.
A record record record record the flight time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of the helicopter operation is well below that rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
'These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds'.
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refunds rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance, and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter ’ s use for the event.
"The idea is to present things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasise that '.
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver ’ s seat.
In the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
'I know Sikorsky very well, 'the President said,' I have three of them '.
TC BW Neuss
Leaders of the second tennis league will take place at the table third search village SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow from 11 a.m. on the table third search village SV.
In spite of five matches still impeccable record, the leader of the Second Tennis League has made sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a quite similar form.
It is precisely on the back positions that I find the team very good '.
For class and stability in the search dorfer SV are mainly imported from the high north.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point out bets in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double, "says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"That will be difficult for us.
You also need a good portion of luck '.
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the french is still active at the Challenge tournament in the Italian Biella, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing at the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will win his first bet in this season.
The hitherto uncovered Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel with Belarus Andrei Vasilevski.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster Alster, Máté Valkusz could return to the team.
Not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was the number one in the junior world ranking in January 2016, is not enough, someone from the trainer college around Marius Zay.
How America Can Impress OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his hatred to enact the law," Congress packed a few "unconstitutional rules", he estimated.
The response from Moscow was also as strong as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US effort.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the domestic OMV, who, together with other European companies, have co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea government Nord Stream 2.
The drought is enormous.
Yet it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the oil company ’ s official statement.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would have to bring sanctions to life through an executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"The press" looked at which the Group could defend and which could really hurt it.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be brought to the fore in Netflix's hit series by Netflix.
Despite the second season of Narcos revealed by Pablo Escobar's Killer, Netflix series is far from over.
The relays three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful gods, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Rolling Back: The City employs 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita-Lunch itself.
With firm contacts for the children and a assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban nurseries.
As of 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over food supplies in the urban children's day facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Aid, this is good news: 'We were all very pleased'.
Cooked is still cooked outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 daycare centres in Krefelder region, and in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunch time.
In the past kitaj risk 2800 children sat at tables, and demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week eat at the Kita lunch," explains Pommeranz.
'The offer is also valid in 35-hour support if children stay until 2 p.m. '.
46 part-time workers have kitchen services from 1 September: they heat the delivered food, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portions individually, distribute the food, remove, wash and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita", says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven-rouge facilities - determines the length of hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts".
That is also the point: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food".
The direct connection of kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for children.
"They have a known force in Kita, a person who is familiar with them and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the job of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to improving the quality of kitchen facilities, the charm that it has proved to be the most cost-effective in comparing costs between self-government and foreign allocation.
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours do not fall so much weight at around 750 people in the educational area", says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan Democracy depends on women ’ s political role, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be standing in the provinces, with three women running for the vice-president ’ s role and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial Council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting to a consultative role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be handed over power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan ’ s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered with a total of 3.6 million registered voters.

Men are trying to lift 13-year-old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are alleged to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year old who stayed with friends on Kolping Street at 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to telephone the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
One of the perpetrators tried to attack the cell phone and the neck of the girl, but that was dismissed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is under way.
GMB concerns about investment in Glasgow McVitie Factory
A trade union wants to ensure that managers of Biskuit manufacturer McVitie, about the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said that the company has remained silent about the future of investments in the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the plant, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVitie's owner, Pladis said that he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be 'the first to know' if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's subsidiary, GMB Scotland McVitie's called on to raise concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being promoted '.
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Place Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and workers are focusing heavily on the local community and the Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Thus, from the perspective of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a prosperous McVitie production presence. "
A spokesman from Pladis said: "The Tollcross branch received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly, because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our tolerance site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site, and if our operations change at the site, employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this. '..,,.,,.....,
Did the PSG Barcelona warned against Neymar three years ago?
The League side may regret its interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not diminish in its persecution of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger its exemption clause, but did they warned Barcelona of the World Record attack three years ago?
The sensational approach fueled the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world,,,,, and.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar forced his way out, though a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to care for it since its arrival in Santos in 2013.
But was the leader of the PSG warned of this prospect three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressed interest in the club at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offer to Neymar.

Interview: 'Domspatzen-report discharge Pope Georg Ratzinger'
The Regensburg Domspatzen-report on the cases of abuse relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church", declared to the German Press Agency that he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their misjudgement at the time.
On the other hand, the Vatican Council, "Osservatore Romano" criticized the use of double standards "in the reporting of violence in domain domains.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that this is' shameful and shameful acts' that should be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation", according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think that is normal," writes Scaraffia.
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "You like to go to the church and this is a wounded Fressen".
She also pointed out that in her youth 'beating was a normal pedagogical means' to deal with naughty children, as I was one. '
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
Papst brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared in connection with the reports on cases of abuse.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the book "My brother of the Pope" My brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages).
"I must protect Georg Ratzinger", says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was appointed by the bishop Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburg domain spatzen were sexually abused "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 domain passages.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be noted that Domkapellmeister R. R. in many cases, forms of physical and mental violence have been used.
Especially with high emotionality, punishment for students could be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him despite violence ".
In the interview Hesemann explains why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal is relieved by Georg Ratzinger.
Mr Hesemann, the 440 page report on the 'incidents of violence on defendants at the Regensburg Domspatzen' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerician and perfectionist, who has often become managerial when a master piece of music did not.
How do you view this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why Georg Ratzinger's name comes from it.
There are just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly free of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The pre-school violence also occurred outside its sphere of activity.
At best, he can be accused of being too late or not taking initial suggestions seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "sympathetic", as an extremely good-minded teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and bons and was always surrounded by children's grapes.
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and high emotionality, which has also led to outbreaks of rage.
He himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he was,,..,,...,.,............
In order to save his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question, the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s, both parents and teachers.
Do you also know such suction methods?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, experienced this in a secular school, a state school.
In comparison with what this report is actually about, namely the horrendous sexual abuse and pre-school violence.
One wonders whether it is not more related to his popularity and role as the brother of Benedikt XVI.
Many who never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
A great deal has been reported in the media about the subject of abuse in the Regensburg domain spatzes.
Will Georg Ratzinger be charged in the final report of any involvement or coexistence with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted himself to the master master.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about this," said one of those concerned, "It was all very embarrassing to me".
The real problem in educating sexual abuse has been, and is that most victims remain silent in shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, it is certainly not a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the domain students rate Ratzinger ’ s role in relation to abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A questioned student put it so: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is also really absurd to assume that it is of all of them... Buben have opened up more forcefully or clearly, rather than towards their parents, boarding managers of trust teachers, etc.
That people talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
Thus, the report comes to the very clear result: "The fact that pupils and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance was not confirmed in the course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be exempt from any coexistence.
In this way, he cannot be accused of not having prevented it or reported.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name to these disgraceful crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, there was much to read about "violent processes" at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Georg Ratzinger, the former master master master of the cathedral, is accused of "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the reporting everything has been mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is exactly what the report is abused.
In fact, there is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the secondary school of domes, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, that is to say from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choral conductor of the Cathedral.
All the terrible teaching of beatings, the cases in which boys have been subjected to blatantly harassed and painted by sadistic teachers, all occurred at the preschool school in Etterzhausen and pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to take place.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he got to face the boys only when they were already on the Cathedral.
On that, as most witnesses have pointed out, the theme "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisical" conditions.
What else was on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence '.
At most, the accusation of having looked away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported on pre-school conditions.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he started to establish himself and not wanted to hear anything from what happened at a school where he was not working and was responsible, (the witness), and then again around 1993.
Was Georg Ratzinger's ears before in..
Michael Hesemann: No, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
He told him that "caning is still practised in pre-school school".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when caning penalties were banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the people concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the limit was actually exceeded.
However, we cannot say that he has always looked away.
That is simply not true.
It was only in 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria., in.,,,.,,., to.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to the time at that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "pitfalls of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating past according to today's moral standards.
The Princess is right.
Of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, nor to what was concealed in the pre-school of hostility and violence against innocent children's souls.
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being dealt with.
At the same time, however, I must protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishment, that is to say, drawing ears and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was banned, he was also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger reproduced in discussions with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope?
Does the subject of caning?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, in other words Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, where the domes played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there.
But this must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution of world-class statehood, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition that went twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and bonbonbonbons alone, you don ’ t make big singers no big singers and before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-expression...
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the conversations on your book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond that, I have met Georg Ratzinger really well and experienced again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deep believing and heartfelt people, from whom one cannot imagine he could do anything for a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former domain tracks still today, 23 years after his emergence, keep in contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who have not yet forgiven him that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the domains are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, father teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a loving respect for whom they are still watching today and who worship them.
I would like to make it quite clear once again: everything he is accused of education, which were the order of the day.
We can be glad that we have gone through this period long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, to become a media scapegoat.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
The report that has just been published relieves it.
Now the decency would require that a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit and without those outside Bayerns and perhaps Germany, no one would know the Regensburg domes.
