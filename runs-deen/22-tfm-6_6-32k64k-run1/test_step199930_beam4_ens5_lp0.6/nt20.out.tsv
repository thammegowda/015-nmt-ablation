Stena Impero Oil Tanks Left Iranian Port	-4.0947
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities , the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " left the port of Bandar Abbas this Friday , in the of in the United Arab .	-5.8698
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian Government on Monday , but it remained in Iranian waters for the time being .	-4.6842
The " Stena Impero " was found on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on charges of violating security regulations , but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker in the UK 's Gibraltar .	-6.9653
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important maritime routes in the world , linking the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean , and much of the global oil exports are being shipped through the straits , and tensions in the region have intensified enormously in recent months , with merchant shipping having been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran , leading to several incidents involving tankers and drones .	-8.8480

Solving the puzzle : that is why we cannot tickle ourselves .	-6.0594
A kind of brake on the brain prevents people from kitting themselves , as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin have discovered with the help of experiments on rats , as they announced on Thursday evening , and progress has been made on the question of why children are so fiercely opposed to tickling , only to demand more .	-8.6669
After all , it has become clear why approaching a tickling hand triggers laughter even before touching .	-8.5119
According to earlier research , rats with " laughter " in ultrasound respond when they are peddled by humans ; this " laughter " is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception .	-6.8942
Laughter oppressed During Self-Touch	-3.9401
It is assumed that the brain can distinguish between touch and touch by others - that is , that people cannot tickle themselves - but the Berlin researchers found in experiments on rats that the laughter and activity of the area in question of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-touch , even when living creatures clean themselves .	-10.8273

Iran Free British Tankers	-2.7027
The general debate in the United Nations did not resolve the Iran conflict , but now there is less of a problem : the British oil tanker Stena Impero , which was held in Iran , could go to sea again , and could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Rouhani ’ s peace plan .	-9.4347

The British Government , behind the establishment of the ' Stena Impero ' , suspected a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar in the UK : a supertanker with oil from Iran , which is alleged to have been destined for Syria , had been ordered in early July by the authorities against EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria , and the US had notified the British of the ship .	-8.6076
The Iranian people spoke of " piracy " and threatened with consequences ; in mid-August , the " Adrian Darya-1 " was finally released , and suspicions that it was a bargaining chip to free the " Stena Impero " were vehemently rejected by London .	-8.4167
The Strait of Hormus is one of the most important maritime routes in the world , linking the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean , and much of the world ’ s oil exports are being shipped through the straits , and tensions in the region have intensified enormously in recent months , with merchant shipping having been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran , with several incidents involving tankers and drones .	-9.0234
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington lies the nuclear dispute between both countries , which the US accuses Iran ’ s leaders of wanting to build nuclear weapons , which Iran rejects in 2018 , when the US unilaterally withdrew from the international nuclear deal , which was supposed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb while ending its political and economic isolation . Since then , the US government has put pressure on Iran ’ s leaders to implement massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a tougher and wider agreement .	-8.6343

India has a better future with its protectionist economic policies .	-2.9510
With the punitive tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese producers , foreign producers in the People ’ s Republic are being forced to re-distribute , with Asian financial leaders considering moving their production from China to another country calling India one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey , though not only because of the vagaries of the Sino-American trade war ; with a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers , India seems poised to play a more prominent role in the largely ramified production chain .	-8.5826
But now India itself has fallen into Trump ’ s focus . From the White House budget , pejorative as the “ Kingdom of Tariffs , ” America removed trade preferences from the emerging world for 2,000 products in early June , with the US accusing India of prohibitively high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods , mobile phones , spirits , motorcycles , and more .	-7.0910
On the world map of trade wars , however , friction with India is merely a side show , and America views the world ’ s largest democracy through the security lens as well . Delhi and Washington combine concern about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean , so a salvo of America ’ s punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely , so India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who has just assumed a second five-year term , is likely to be lulled into doubt .	-9.2815
The problem , however , lies elsewhere : the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development is a difficult one in the Socialist Republic of India , even under Modi , whose zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long ; firms now receive rapid building permits ; they benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure ; and a more effective bankruptcy and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for liquidating fake firms with high debt .	-10.1094

In the West , Modi depends on the nimbus of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country economically , owing not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like . At its core , the India First Advocate has never relied on protectionist economic policies , preventing Indian firms from being forced to get rid of anachronistic practices and become fit for global competition . Business people who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries belong to the tribal constituencies of Modi ’ s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party , and who lament this shortsighted policy .	-9.0550

Brexit Debate Is Like a Park Walk	-3.1925
The intense verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not , according to his top adviser , contribute to a climate of hatred .

Nigeria ’ s Police Liberation Hundreds of Misguided Boys	-4.1813
In Nigeria , the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a school in the city of Kaduna in northern Nigeria , following evidence from local security forces , and have discovered some minor victims , as police officer Yakubu Sabo has reported .	-8.2990
The young were held under the pretext of being taught and " improved " in the Koran ; in fact , the guards were held under " most degrading and inhuman conditions " by their teachers , said Sabo : about a in , including children of .	-9.1703
According to reports , the Koranic school has been in existence for about ten years , and local residents would have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility , and parents would have been shocked to learn about the conditions in the Koranic school , said Sabo , who had not foreseen the suffering of their children , and the operator and six staff were arrested according to the police .	-9.6507
Nigeria ’ s predominantly Muslim north has many private coran schools , which replace the often deficient state institutions , and the region ’ s people suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs , which is why , according to the UN Refugee Agency , more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to neighboring Niger over the past ten .	-7.6052
Assured and tortured , Nigeria ’ s police force is lifting 400 children out of school .	-4.8126
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria have freed almost 400 students from appalling conditions : ' Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries pointing to torture , ' said police officer Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna .	-9.5321
On Thursday , the children were discovered in an Islamic school , where conditions were ' inhumane ' , and the officials arrested the head of the school and six teachers after the liberation operation .	-7.1485

World Football Election : Further Accusations of Messis and Klopps Kür	-3.5978
Football ' Signature Not valid '	-3.0475
Jürgen Klopp , Lionel Messi and Megan Rapidoe awarded	-3.9662
With a gala in Milan , the world football association Fifa is the best player , the best player and the best coach of the year .	-5.5208
After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election , other countries have complained to Fifa , and Egypt has not been judged , on a curious basis .	-7.0178
In recent years , there has been a lot of bad news about Fifa : the World Cup awards , the dubious plans of its President , Gianni Infantino , the general behaviour of various corrupt officials .	-7.7840
But , having already complained that Nicaragua ’ s captain had not voted at all , other inconsistencies have emerged : Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Batry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account ; indeed , they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting list .	-7.0788
Fifa apologises for the fact that ' the signatures on the forms had been filed in capital letters and therefore not valid ' , and has been contacted several times by the Egyptian Association to clarify the situation - without a reply .	-8.1315
Sudan ’ s Trainer puzzled	-5.4762
While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable , the Sudanese Association states that the coach , Zdravko Lugarisic , did not vote in the way it was finally judged : with Lionel Messi at number one , Virgil van Dijk at two , and Sadio Mané at three , according to Fif, with signatures and official stamp from the Sudanese Association .	-7.4458
Nicaragua 's captain , Juan Barrera , had also accused me of not having voted for the # TheBest2019 Awards , and all my votes are wrong , , ” he , , and , , , and .	-7.9836
The announcement came from the Association on Friday : it was true , but of course it was not an intention : the ballot papers filled out were " mistakenly marked " with the name and signature of Juan Barrera , the captain of the Nicaraguan selection , it was stated in a communication from the Association , but the second captain , Manuel Rosas , elected " We take responsibility for the administrative error , " said the communication , but both Rosas and team coach Henry Duvoted for Messi , " in FIFA 's official list " .

Ukraine ’ s Case : Ranghigh Republicans favor official investigation .	-4.3726
" I think the investigation is important , " said the Republican governor of the state of Vermont , Phil Scott . " Where this is from here , it is determined by the facts that are found , " and he wants to know more about the whistleblowers affair before action is taken .	-6.8171
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine , according to Scott , " for years . "	-5.3550
The Republicans have so far been reluctant to criticize Trump for the whistleblowers affair , and few have shown unease . Scott ’ s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party , with the moderate governor of Virginia repeatedly challenging Trump ’ s policies , such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations .	-7.5509
As another senior Republican , Charlie Baker , Governor of Massachusetts , argued for the investigation . " It is a deeply disturbing situation , " Baker said , " the right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate and get to the bottom of the matter .	-9.3447
Scott and Baker formally have no say in the US state governor ’ s case against Trump , which is being decided in Congress , so their remarks are mostly symbolically important , but even the first Republican senators have been critical of the situation , with Mitt Romney , for example , representing Utah in the second chamber of parliament , saying that the case was " extremely disturbing , deeply disturbing . "	-8.6209
The affair could result in Trump ’ s impeachment , the House Democrats have announced an investigation , accusing him of abusing power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political .	-5.2570
There is no precise timetable for impeachment ; with a majority in the House of Representatives , the Democrats could make an “ impeachment , ” but the decision to impeach him would fall in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority , so the chances of success are slim . So far , no US president has been impeached by an impeachment process .	-8.3678
Were torturers on board Racketes " Sea Watch " ?	-2.2160
Three men have been arrested in Sicily , allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps .	-2.3283
The German captain Carola Rackete ( 31 ) was arrested in June after having illegally entered the port of Lampedusa with the rescue boat " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 Libyan refugees on board .	-4.9349
" We can 't rule out this , but we have no guaranteed information about it , " said Ruben Neugebauer , spokesman of the German Press Agency .	-12.9138
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped , tortured and even murdered : they were Mohammed C. ( 27 ) from Guinea , and the two Egyptians Hameda A. ( 26 ) and Mahmoud A ( 24 ) .	-4.4223
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes on the ships : ' We cannot scan who the people are , who do not have passports , ' said Neugebauer , and torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing from Libya , so it is very likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships ' , so it is ' .	-14.7485
Italy ’ s right-wing ex-Interior Minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete , who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration .	-3.3616

Tesla head Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record numbers .	-4.8114
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries , " Musk wrote to Tesla staff in an email published by the industry blog " Electrek " .	-4.4185

US dispute over financing for the bridge once more	-8.4995
The new financial year will start in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget , with the Senate following the House of Representatives on Thursday and deciding on transitional financing until 21 November .	-5.1485
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending limits for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years , the United States will once again have no spending plans ahead of the new fiscal year beginning on October 1 . The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing ( Continuing Resolution , CR ) until November 21 . Without such a decision , a shutdown would have occurred on Monday at midnight , a federal government partial shutdown .	-8.4985
Shutdown Off	-2.5200
For the time being , the federal administration is being financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 , which is due to the fact that the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities .	-7.5433
The Democrats have enacted ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives , where they hold the majority , but spending laws reflect Democrats ’ priorities , which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate , and the Senate has more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans that are unlikely to win a majority .	-6.8948
In the Senate , the Republicans seem to be trying to force $ 12 billion to build the Wall , one of Trump ’ s main priorities . Democrats are disturbed by the wall plans and their financing , which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects .	-8.2238
Separating the Wall	-2.9043
At the moment , it is not clear how the parties want to move closer on this issue , and more likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws over the next seven weeks is an extension of transitional financing beyond November 21 , and no shutdown is ruled out .	-7.1031
In 1877 , federal government funding would automatically continue at the level of the previous year , discourage parliamentarians from travelling and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were submitted .	-9.5509
France Allowing Lesbians and Singles to Fertilize	-4.1488
In France , artificial insemination is to continue to be open to all women and lesbians living in the future : the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that would allow all women to benefit from in-vitro fertilisation , which is likely to increase significantly the demand for anonymous sperm donations .	-7.2289
In the course of a three-day emotional debate , critics on the right had warned that many " children without a father " might grow up in the future .	-10.6909
The new regulation is the core of a Bioethics Act , which the Minister of Health , Agnès Buzyn , defended as an " opportunity " for society .	-7.3594
Further prohibition of insemination with sperm from dead husband	-4.7150
The National Assembly , on the other hand , rejected by a narrow majority an amendment to allow widows to have access to the sperm of their dead man for artificial insemination ; in Belgium , Spain and the United Kingdom , artificial insemination is permitted ' post-mortem ' ; in Germany , there have been cases in the past in which women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased person ; in Paris , opponents of the offense argued that a child of this kind bears a ' particularly serious fate ' .	-10.2956
Many members of the government party La République en Marche ( The Republic on the Move , LREM ) , led by President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition , argued for artificial insemination with the sperm of the late partner , emphasizing that a widow would be subjected to a " double grief " if her husband 's death unsatisfied her desire to have children .	-7.4640
The initiators of the amendment , which has now failed , consider it unfair that in future , a widow can be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown , but not with that of her own partner .	-5.7647
To date , artificial insemination is only permitted in France to heterosexual couples who cannot bear children , who must be married or live together for at least two years .	-6.2264
In Germany , artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples .	-4.1867
Climate compensation : Calls for air taxes to be paid to universities are louder	-6.4834
There is a lot of traffic going on at universities , which is why the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in future too , and the rectors say that they have no money for it , but now they are also coming under internal pressure .	-7.6217

Russia Retains North Korean Fishermen	-2.6044
According to the FSB secret service , the detainees are alleged to have fished illegally in Russian waters , and , ten days earlier , 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested , when a shot was exchanged between the border guards and the crew of the boat , injuring three Russians and a North Korean , the fisherman later took his serious injuries , but this time there were no injured , it was said .	-9.2531

The new inspections found and confiscated 30,000 octopus on the boats and claimed that three fishing boats and two motorboats were confiscated and brought to Vladivostok after Nachodka and Posjet .	-7.9618
Russia ’ s fisheries authorities had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year , even after complaints from local entrepreneurs , and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested for a while this year , according to the media .	-6.5988
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far East region of Primorje , Georgi Martynov , recently complained about high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen , who fished with Russian-banned small-meshed synthetic nets , which would also take small creatures out of the sea , and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea where they would need 200 years to be broken up .	-7.4983

The " most generous nation in history " : Donald Trump , here at a meeting with elected White House police .	-2.7103
The richest country in the world is closing its doors to those seeking protection : as the State Department in Washington has confirmed , the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be further lowered , and , in the future , especially threatened believers and Iraqis will be granted asylum .	-8.2799
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low threshold for receiving new refugees again , with a maximum of 18,000 people allowed in by 2020 in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020 , as the US State Department has said . In the nearly past year , the limit is 30,000 people .	-7.3864
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has dramatically reduced the appetite for protection seekers from around the world in recent years , with much higher reception limits set by Barack Obama ’ s predecessor .	-6.9097
The target limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980 , but the State Department called the US " the most impoverished and generous nation in history , " a phrase that recalls the language used by the current US president .	-5.5534
“ A responsible approach ” to refugees is aimed at enabling refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild , ” he said .	-8.8188
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico that Trump is trying to tear down . To finance the construction of a border wall , Trump had imposed a state of national emergency . Whether there is a temporal connection between the current action and current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear . Trump is currently under pressure from the Selenskyj affair and a possible threat of impeachment .	-8.1522
According to the Foreign Office , the US government intends to focus in future on the admission of two groups of refugees : people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country , and who have been put at risk as a result , as stated in the Foreign Office statement , whereas a maximum of 1 500 refugees are to be received from Honduras , Guatemala and El Salvador .	-8.7164

Stopping Brexit Negotiations : The Danger of No Deal remains acute .	-4.0060
In fact , Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made it clear that there will be no third postponement of the Brexit negotiations , but what remains of eternal duration in the polarized British . The Supreme Court ’ s recent judgment in Britain hovers like a sword of Damocles over the blonder ’ s head , with its suspension of parliament to pursue its Brexit course stubbornly until the exit date annulled earlier this week , and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend the bilateral talks until 31 October in the event of failed negotiations with the EU , which Johnson categorically ruled out .	-9.9641
Boris Johnson deems Deal Possible	-2.2775
But the pressure does not seem to pass much of Johnson either , as he suggested when he visited a hospital that he would support an extension of negotiations until the end of October if he did not do so :	-6.7571
You know , we will abide by the law .	-2.9976
At the same time , however , we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October .	-1.9623
I am cautiously optimistic that this will work .	-2.8936
And the Brexit negotiators in Brussels are running out of time , with the EU and British negotiators still having some six weeks to avoid Britain ’ s withdrawal from the European Union without an agreement . But the recent talks have failed to achieve a breakthrough again . An agreement by the end of October now seems rather difficult to imagine . If the British Prime Minister does not enact the law , a further postponement of the exit date is in force , but the opposition does not trust the prime minister ’ s words , fearing that Johnson might somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal .	-9.2099

A phone call in Ukraine , and everything is broken ? US President Donald Trump could indeed face impeachment proceedings after the tumultuous revelations of recent days , Democrats want to examine it as soon as possible – weeks to make a decision . .	-9.7705
At the beginning of the scandal , the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj reportedly began , and the whistleblowers ’ charge , which ultimately brought the conversation to the public with his complaint out of concern for national security and US democracy , is monstrous : the president has used the power of his office to use another country ’ s government to influence the 2020 election , using Ukraine ’ s dependence to blackmail it and forcing it to act against a political opponent .	-8.7151
The core of this effort can also be found in the now-released transcript of the interview with Selenskyj , though it does not reflect the full text , but the July 25 phone call is only an episode of a much larger story , centered above all on Trump ’ s personal lawyer , Rudy Giuliani .	-7.7481
History begins from the public 's point of view in May 2019 , when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani 's travel plans to Ukraine ; he wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj , and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate . " We do not interfere in an election , we interfere in an investigation into what we have the right to do , " he says inappropriate to the newspaper : one might think it is , but " this is not illegal . " Giuliani wants an investigation in Ukraine , in - " , , , , , and . .	-11.9079
The attorney and former New York mayor seem to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump ’ s opponent in the 2016 election : Hillary Clinton spiked with actors in Ukraine , critics said , to create an occasion for the US Russia investigation , but that charge was never taken seriously .	-6.5558
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk so prominently about on the phone with Selenskyj in July . The version of Giulianis and the president is that former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidate , Joe Biden , urged the dismissal of then-Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin , as the Obama administration ’ s Ukrainian envoy , to stop the gas company ’ s investigation , for which he was responsible , with his son , Hunter Biden , on the board .	-10.0570
In fact , when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General should go , the gas company ’ s investigations had already been completed , with Hunter Biden never directly affected , and Schokin himself accused of deeply corrupt behavior , with the US government far from being the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal , and the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation of the company .	-7.5636

Does the UK government want to circumvent Brexit law ?	-9.9734
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains oblivious to whether he is seeking ways to circumvent Parliament ’ s recent anti-Brexit law , and , on a question , he merely told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law .	-7.6257
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal if no agreement was reached with the EU by mid-October , Johnson criticises it as a " surrender law " that made negotiations with the EU more difficult .	-6.3804
On Thursday , former British Prime Minister John Major suggested that Johnson might try to use " political chicanery " to circumvent the law , and Johnson could use a procedural ploy to postpone the law 's entry into force until after leaving the EU .	-5.8582

Iran seems to be touting uranium enrichment	-2.6428
Iran 's President Hassan Rouhani has stepped up the pressure on the European contractors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal .

" Those who make such accusations must provide evidence , " Rowhani said , but European leaders would not have been able to do so in talks with him during the UN general debate ; instead , they would have merely claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this ; Rouhani had met German Chancellor Angela Merkel , French President Emmanuel Macron , and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days .	-7.2996
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump , Rouhani demanded that the US administration ’ s far-reaching sanctions be lifted , calling on the Washington administration to shift to a policy of “ dialogue and reason . ”	-6.1613
Crossed by another Star	-3.7824
Astronomers are now observing a comet from the depths of the outer space , which had been achieved before .	-7.3629
What was initially only a conjecture is now confirmed : an interstellar guest crosses our solar system .	-5.4524
On 30 August , the long-winded comet was discovered by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter .	-5.5374
2I / Borisov is , after 1I / ' Oumuamua of 2017 , only the second interstellar object that was sighted during a flight through our solar system .	-4.4657
2I / Borisov provides astronomers with a rare opportunity to get a glimpse of a strange solar system from close range before they can see it again .	-7.4243
According to the analysis , the comet is on the way to a so-called hyper trajectory that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin , as the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) announced , and is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies .	-7.1362
The Astronomers are lucky : unlike 1I / ' Oumuamua , 2I / Borisov has already been spotted , leaving researchers many months to study , " the object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will with medium sized telescopes until in April 2020 , " explained Farnocchia .	-8.2650
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor , such as Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii , who had already conducted the characterisation of 1I / ' Oumuamua , in an initial study determining the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 km .	-8.4875
Researchers from the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands ( IAC ) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar welding star , which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition .

Recovering Washington : Trump ’ s Gathering anonymous Tipper in Ukraine	-4.9514
In the Ukraine affair of US President Donald Trump ’ s possible abuse of power , he wants to find possible leaks in the White House .	-4.2241
“ I want to know who gave the whistleblowers the information , ” Trump said in front of United Nations officials in New York on Thursday , who was almost “ a spy , ” and treated .	-9.3175
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate donors , but the event was not actually open to the public on Friday , but several US media reported audio recordings of the speech , and Democrats were outraged by the president ’ s statement .	-9.4457
On Tuesday , the Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced preparations for impeachment against Trump , based mainly on a written complaint by an anonymous intelligence worker making serious allegations against Trump and his central office , and on strong public pressure , the announcement was made public on Thursday .	-7.9548
As part of his work , the whistleblower wants information from several government officials that the US president " uses the power of his office " to ensure that another country interferes in the US election of 2020 in his favor .	-4.7723
At the heart of the charges is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July , in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that might harm his political rival , Joe Biden , who was doing business in Ukraine earlier by Biden ’ s son , Hunter , and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukraine ’ s judiciary . Biden is ahead of the race for democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election .	-7.9661
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukrainian telephone , saying that senior government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover , but , as usual , an electronic text protocol had been drawn up , which was removed from a database normally provided for by White House jurists and stored instead in a specially protected system .	-10.7858
The intelligence agency 's identity is not publicly known ; the New York Times reported that intelligence officers . intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence . intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence . intelligence intelligence	-12.0088
On Friday , Trump once again questioned the source ’ s credibility ; in a series of tweets on the subject , the president wrote , among other things , that the “ whistleblower ” had spread second-hand information that might have turned out to be inaccurate , so there may be no tippers or spies .	-6.6645
But , as Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have provided information to Whistleblower , he was outraged . US House President Nancy Pelosi responded with concern and complained that Trump ’ s statement was undermining the government ’ s integrity .	-7.6993
In the House of Representatives , several parliamentary committees have been conducting various investigations against Trump and his entourage for months . Given Ukraine ’ s allegations , the Democrats are now pushing an investigation with renewed vigor to initiate a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump .	-7.5658
“ The Whistleblower has given us a road map for our investigation , ” said the head of the House of Representatives ’ Intelligence Committee , Adam Schiff , who attacked the ship , reproached him for misrepresenting the situation , and called again for the committee chairman ’ s resignation , who routinely , , , months ago .	-8.2378
More than 300 former US security and foreign policy officials , most of whom served under Democratic and Republican presidents , backed the Democrats ’ investigation of possible impeachment in a statement released on Friday . If the allegations were true , it would be “ a ruthless abuse of power ” by Trump , it said .	-7.4080
There is no precise timetable for the process to proceed , with a majority in the House of Representatives that would allow Democrats to pursue an impeachment process , but the decision to impeach him would fall in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans are in the majority , so the chances of success are slim . So far , no US president has been impeached by an impeachment process .	-9.5084
VW works council : jobs are being cut ' creeping ' .	-4.8092
The Volkswagen brand ’ s plans to cut costs further in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe , a concern that drives the works council of the automobile manufacturer , which wants to reduce its annual factory costs of € 10 billion by € 2 billion by 2023 , of which € 500 million is to be saved this year .	-8.0028
The " Future Pact " , negotiated between companies and works councils in 2016 , already provides for the loss of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020 .	-5.6344
However , as our newspaper has learned from business council circles , jobs in production that are not actually available are gradually being dismantled by another route - that is , by passing the official course - which often means that vacant regular posts would not be occupied again .	-15.1354
In these cases , the works council has no way of forcing the reoccupation , and there are now a lot of staff lacking , the compression of labour is on the increase , concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicle works are on the increase , and so there is also a fear that vehicle production might gradually be taken out of Germany and Europe , because it is cheaper in other parts of the world , and the only thing we heard from the VW is that the volume of employment will be adjusted along the demographic curve in a socially acceptable way , as agreed .	-13.9443
The Volkswagen brand wants to standardize production worldwide and centrally manage new projects , which will also reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim of which is to increase productivity and hence competitiveness .	-8.4018

The victims were between 17 and 22 years old and , with the help of Libyan smugglers , they were brought across the Mediterranean in rubber boats , but the dream of a better future was not fulfilled ; in Germany , they were distributed to different brothels to deal with the alleged smuggling costs of an average of EUR 25 000 , so they were paid completely .	-7.8080
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted that the young Nigerians were smuggling into brothels and then distributing them on brothels .	-6.7858

On Thursday , former British Prime Minister John Major suggested that Johnson might try to use " political chicanery " to circumvent the law , and that the prime minister could use a procedural ploy to postpone the law 's entry into force until after leaving the EU .	-6.4161

The economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York has calculated that WeWork rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan over the past 24 months , one of the world ’ s most expensive real estate markets . WeWorks ’ s new contracts alone meant that the demand for offices in New York was greater than that of the new areas that came onto the market at the time .

He was born in New York City , New York , and moved to at .	-11.9940
On Wednesday , at the time of Question Time in the House of Commons , this was met with massive opposition indignation , and more critics have spoken : dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson .	-8.9528
The well-known journalist and author told the channel Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation , as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be " hanged , hanged , divided , tested , and punched , " which they found highly reprehensible , not to recognize the version of their brother , said Rachel Johnson , who was standing in the European Parliament elections for the anti-Brexit party , Change UK .	-10.5716
She was particularly struck by her brother , Jo Cox , a pro-EU member of the House of Commons who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi just days before the 2016 Brexit referendum , whose memories can best be honoured by pushing Brexit through , Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons : " It is very distasteful to refer to a member murdered by someone who called Britain first , " now Johnson 's sister criticized .	-9.6445
" It makes me sick if Jos 's name is used in this way , " he tweeted , and the best way to honor them is to argue passionately and resolutely for what you believe to be the case , no matter what view you think , but never to " demonize the other side , " he also complained that an atmosphere was created in which attacks became more likely .	-9.8414

An actor and youtube turns Egypt ’ s rulers into rulers : for the time being , however , Mohamed Ali prefers to remain abroad .	-5.6991
The two men who have an influence on whether blood is flowing back on the streets of Egypt spent the last week abroad ; one of them was back at Cairo airport on Friday ; President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly ; the former general who removed Muslim Brotherhood Mohammed Morsi , the country ’ s first freely elected head of state in 2013 , had spent a pleasant time in New York : US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi ’ s actions against political Islam and had not lost a syllable about human rights violations at the Nile – in a week in which Egypt ’ s security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president .	-10.9515
Ali , who is currently in the streets of Egypt , is a man who , according to the president , is trying to fool himself : Mohamed Ali , of course , stayed abroad , escaping the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil .	-13.0665

When the Provider Promises Too Much	-1.5439
If the Internet connection appears to be much slower than advertised by the provider , there are several ways to check .	-6.0491
If you enter into an Internet contract , you do not need to trust the speed information of the providers blindly .	-7.4042
After all , the previously promised transmission rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved , explains the Consumer Centre in Bavaria .	-4.9451
If the connection appears to be much slower than advertised by the provider , there are various test possibilities .	-6.4207
" However , the supplier tests are based on the specific requirements of the supplier and are therefore not calculated in a uniform and objective manner " , says the consumer centre of Bavaria on its side .	-8.0746

Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly telephoned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine , for Trump has been “ watching Biden for years . ”	-5.0792
Republicans have so far resisted criticism of Trump for the whistleblowers affair , and few have shown discomfort . Scott ’ s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party .

The increased figures have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement , which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants illegally entering the Greek islands via Turkey , in exchange for receiving a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian who has been deported .	-6.2876

The Canadian Green boss holds a multi-way hand on a photo , but now it has come out : the cup has been manipulated .	-7.5156
The Canadian National Post reported that the recycled coffee cup with metal straw had never been held in the hands of Elizabeth May , the leader of the Canadian Green Party .	-12.4371
The Green Leader Must Respond for the Photopane	-7.9612
The National Post then accused May of manipulation , and that the Party produces fake news to be more credible about “ environmental protection , ” in the midst of an election campaign to the House of Commons , in which Trudeau , too , finds it increasingly difficult to corrupt .	-7.2967
The photo went viral in the social media and intensified the discussion about fake news .	-5.8306
May was shocked and prayed on her blog that she had not known about this action .	-6.1647

Influencecerin wants free upgrade : lifelong flight ban at Cathay	-3.3317
She is said to have received an email from Cathay Pacific requesting an upgrade , but when she asked for it at check-in she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again .	-7.1200
Upon check-in , many passengers dream of an instant upgrade to Business Class , sometimes lucky , and the economy class staff offer a free change .	-9.0078
This case shows how not to do it : A self-declared Influencrin has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade .	-7.3117
On the way back , the airline ’ s Jaqueline staff refused to upgrade , even though they reported an email announcing that their Cathay Pacific had promised an upgrade .	-10.0834
On the return flight , Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight , this time the woman reported the same mail , but with a different reference number .	-7.3859
The airline staff at the airport canceled jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific .	-5.0651
In her case , the Influencecerin turned to Elliot Advocacy , a company that represents consumer interests , because , while Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket , Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket .	-7.7175
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the meta data of the mail , the case remains clear : Cathay has committed fraud , it remains closed for future flights , and the airline 's terms and conditions also say that it does not have to pay the new flight , which Jaqueline does not want to settle for - and now uses a lawyer .	-9.0335
Oil Prices After Yemen ’ s Armistice Report	-2.9892
Oil prices dropped by more than a dollar on Friday afternoon in a very short space of time , with a barrel ( 159 liters ) of the North Sea variety Brent costing $ 61.83 – about 1.4 % less than the previous day .	-7.3403
The coup was triggered by a report by the Wall Street Journal on a cease-fire in Yemen , with Saudi Arabia agreeing to a ceasefire in four areas .	-7.2857
A drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil assets had brought down five per cent of global oil production in mid-September . The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in Yemen ’ s civil war had called for the attacks ; Saudi Arabia , like the US government , blames Iran ; a ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region .	-6.1214
If an agreement is reached , it can focus on growth and demand , said Ole Hansen , head of the Commodity Strategy Department at Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency .	-4.4777
Oil prices are continuing to decline in recent days , with a barrel of WTI oil costing nearly $ 59 a week ago , Brent costing nearly $ 65 .	-4.8731
Most recently , citing insiders , Bloomberg reported that after the mid-September attack , oil repair operations in Saudi Arabia were moving faster than expected , with output reaching eight million barrels a day and moving again toward the original amount .	-7.5914
Most recently , there have been press reports , citing insiders , that Saudi Aramco , a state-owned oil company , is making rapid progress in repair work , but commodity experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is now planning to go public and avoiding negative headlines .	-8.6195
At the same time , the conflict between Iran and Western countries was beginning to ease somewhat : the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " was on the way to leaving the port more than two months after the Iranian settlement and the recent release .	-7.4126
But the US announced that it would transfer defensive missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia as Iran ’ s arch-enemy , and fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom had , at times , driven oil prices up sharply in recent weeks .	-6.2769

In the case of US President Donald Trump ’ s possible abuse of power , accusations of cover-ups against the White House have been made , with several senior officials making strenuous efforts to prevent access to the text of the meeting at the end of July , following a disputed phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj , a House of Representatives Democrat Nancy Pelosi , a White House Democrat , explicitly accusing the White House of a “ witch-hunt . ”	-9.1748
North Korea Fears Trump and Kim ’ s Third Summit	-2.8852
North Korea has raised doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon culminate in a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump . The purpose and prospects for success of such a meeting are questionable , owing to lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore , top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said Friday , according to the agency KCNA .	-7.0886
The US has not yet done anything to implement last year 's summit decisions , said the North Korean State Department adviser , criticizing the tightening of US sanctions and joint US and South Korean military exercises , but hoping for a " wise " and " brave " decision by Trump to restore rapprochement .	-7.4602
On Monday , Trump said that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before declaring his willingness to do so , and negotiations to disarm North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile programs have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February , when both met in June in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas they agreed to revive the talks , but so far without much success .	-6.7934

British Pound Under Pressure	-3.1178
With interest rates falling soon , the pound is losing value against the euro .	-3.8173
Frankfurt ’ s speculation that the Bank of England ( BoE ) will soon lower interest rates is attributable to sterling , with the UK ’ s currency reduced on Friday by up to 0.4 % to $ 1.2269 .	-7.7269
The announcement was made by central banker Michael Saunder , who raised a cut in interest rates , even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted , because uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future . This is surprising , as Saunders was seen as a champion of tight monetary policy , said the broker Ricardo Evangelista of ActivTrades .	-8.9853
Last week , the Bank of England had already pointed out the strain on the economy caused by the Brexit hiccup , without indicating a direct cut in interest rates , and Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to leave the EU on 31 October if necessary , even without a divorce agreement .	-7.6991

Doping : Further Russian Manipulation	-3.4550
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman , former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( Wada ) and today 's head of the World Federation of Athletics .	-6.3544
In January 2019 , Moscow ’ s doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency ( Wada ) .	-4.4291
In December 2014 , systematic fraud in Russian sport was revealed , after which the Wada had closed the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( Rusada ) for three years , during which time Russian athletes were not entirely banned from the world stage .	-6.1803
The Missing Positions	-3.0390
In the following September , the Wada lifted the Rusada ban , but demanded access to the laboratory and the trials in question .	-6.4869
" We received the data nine months ago and we should check whether the task force has received the right data , " said David Howman in Friday 's interview with the " Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung " .	-5.9032
The World Cup Not affected	-2.8221
This confirms the position of the IAAF : the Association of Athletics is the only organisation to remain under the spell of Russia , and at the World Cup in Doha 30 Russian athletes are running under a neutral flag , having to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and are undergoing testing .	-9.0473
At the beginning of this week , the Wada had already launched manipulations and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks , and Russia is now threatening to ban the Rusada once again and , in the worst case , to ban the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo .	-7.0925
