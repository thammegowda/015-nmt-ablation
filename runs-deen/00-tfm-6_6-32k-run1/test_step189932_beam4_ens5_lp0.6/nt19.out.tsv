Freedom of the Press : Federal Government Defends Rauswurf the journalist	-2.8485
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended a journalist ’ s robbery at the press conference of German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan .	-3.8366
In the Chancellery , the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had a t-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription " Freiheit für Journalisten " and had gone into the front row .	-5.5662
The t-shirt , had not been the problem , said Seibert the picture on Sunday .	-2.2705
It was a question of disrupting the running of the press conference .	-8.0032
The action of the journalist has caused a great deal of unrest , which is unacceptable .	-4.1959
That is why he has led people to take the man out .	-6.0847
Seibert said that it is not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor 's office .	-3.8395
This applies entirely irrespective of whether or not it is a legitimate concern .	-4.3719

Munich : Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller	-2.0454
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking : Florian David Fitz .	-3.4555
We have to look at this twice : yes , that really is Florian David Fitz .	-4.3819
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night !	-2.2510
Hamburg - The talk show " Inas Nacht " , produced by the NDR , is known for moist conversations at the bar of the Hamburg dock " Schellfischposten " .	-5.4114
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests with a lot of beer , some wine or even more sophisticated drinks to relax the mood and tongues .	-6.1034
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory songs .	-5.0378
On Friday , another episode of the popular talk show was recorded .	-2.4127
This time : actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as " Men 's Hearts " , " Terror - Your Judgment " or " Der geilste Tag " .	-3.9959
However , the trip to the far north was not good at Munich .	-5.6975
On Saturday he made a selfless post - his face is completely shattered , the eyes are only two small slits .	-9.8659
The bed fever shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz .	-4.2674
But he is not sick , he has only a powerful cat .	-3.4068
He sent some insights to his fans , probably not entirely serious , that he has now won : " Rule one : go NIE to Inas night .	-7.5150
Rule two : never drink the black sauce .	-2.3439
And injection .	-1.8088
And the round Eierlikör , which squeezes Ina at half three , also leaves . .	-8.0206
Alcohol consumption is a fact of life for the 43-year-old .	-5.0935
His fans immediately posted some tips to combat the aftermath .	-4.5325
They consisted of instant brewing , fish rolls , or perhaps the most appropriate headache tablets .	-6.1476
Others simply enjoyed the view of the normally attractive cinema bar .	-3.8010
How Ina Müller survived the nightly suction bench is not yet known .	-3.8409
As she has moderated the TV fun at the bar since 2007 , the 53-year-old seems to be more experienced ...	-5.3643
On a beer with Ina Müller .	-1.4789
Treysa Fights Vandalism and Distress	-2.7000
The access to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle track in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and wasted .	-6.4035
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought , but solutions are scarcely apparent .	-3.1223
Sherbs , cigarette dumps , rubbish and debris , demolished dustbins and meanwhile dismantled signposts - this has been the starting point for a long time with a seat group to the cycle path on the Haessen Hill in Treysa .	-7.9055
For the flagship railway bike trail in the Rotkäppchenland a more than disgraceful sight .	-5.7171
The topic has occupied members of the ADFC district group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time , according to the bike traffic officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen .	-10.6709
The problem has already been raised in the Bicycle Advisory Council .	-3.3364
There is no solution .	-2.3796
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seat group to the regular discharge of waste containers and the cleaning of the areas at the entry point .	-6.0033
" I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible other activities , " says Wüstenhagen .	-4.2963
Guido Hahn ( ADFC ) reports that the topic has also been included in the local council .	-4.0921
It is not only the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebrations at weekends .	-4.8931
Not only does it sound often , but it also destroys the joints : upwards from the ground , dustbins demolished , signs turned over , seat furniture smeared .	-9.0280
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often , says ADFC member Susanne Klippert .	-2.5979
But the actions are just the proverbial drop in the ocean .	-2.9328
You are annoyed that the resting place at the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for sauna camps .	-5.5846
" Along the entire cycle path there is a clear focus here on the Haaße-hill " , confirms the cyclist , who now also cares about the new cyclist in goat grove , which is being opened today .	-8.1621
'If it suffers the same fate , it will be very expensive ' .	-4.2177
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill : " This may set the threshold significantly higher to grab public property .	-6.3577
However , this would presuppose that a police strike would be passed quickly .	-6.4822
In principle , Wüstenhagen would like to see the Haaße hill developed .	-3.7821
It must be made more attractive .	-1.2250
The frequency of the cycle path so far can be very satisfied .	-4.7530
Tourism marketing is still capable of expansion .	-5.1300
Our cycle path is of very high quality compared to others in Germany " , says the ADFC members .	-4.8126
As an extremely critical danger point , ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation on Ascheröder Street in Treysa .	-4.6438
There is no bend trail on Haaße Hill .	-3.8740
In the case of frequent traffic , cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow , " she explains .	-4.8752
This would not be a problem for sporty drivers , but for the elderly and especially for children .	-4.2802
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof : The " Kö von Hiltrup " and the lake .	-3.1828
The first call to the music contest was a success , creative and in collaboration .	-3.6145
" D a song for Hiltrup " is the appeal of the Stadtteiloffensive Hiltrup , in the " Musikcontest für große und kleine , junge und erfahrene Musiker " .	-4.2137
A contest " with winks in the friendly Hiltruper family " , as Karl Franke put it .	-3.2741
In fact , it was soon a family partnership with coffee and cake from the Honorary Office of the Cultural Centre .	-6.5397
Seven formations took place , from the one-man band to the big ensemble : Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied , Henk Humberg with guitar , Rolf Ihmig , a long night performer living in Hiltrup , the Nine of the " Hiltruper Sternfarben " , three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families , an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties .	-4.5383
This contest , said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt , is a novelty .	-3.3270
We have not seen this in other parts of the city .	-2.9787
What were the textures associated with ?	-3.7445
The Hiltruper Lake and the Market avenue were particularly mentioned in the villages .	-6.5705
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his striking song to the " Kö von Hiltrup " .	-3.2576
The cultural station was also appreciated .	-4.2782
Time and again we were talking about living together in these places , especially at Alvin Jasic .	-4.8880
Karl Franke animated the short breaks of rebuilding with short interviews with the artists or references to their work .	-5.1389
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry , but now also teach guitar .	-4.9780
From the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann , Franke was able to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest .	-5.5105
Meanwhile Alvin Jasic has placed a lot on Youtube .	-3.3241
" It 's not about winning , " Franke said .	-2.3648
In fact , all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy .	-2.7883
However , there was something special for the jury 's favourites - so that others could also listen to their songs .	-5.0443
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann .	-2.2720
Other musicians can record a song : Ihmig with his help drummer , who impressed Franke with his musicality , and the " Lummerland Rudel " : " a very beautiful performance " with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon , Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle .	-5.2676
Like all of them , the children once again played at the final - and even without electronic support , as Franke said , " really good " .	-6.8015
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality , reference to Hiltrup , intransigence of the melody and recognition value .	-4.1955
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische Schule für Musik , Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven , Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive .	-3.6252
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence .	-4.8803
She considered the event a complete success .	-4.4179
All are " very satisfied " , and " the atmosphere was good " in the soon very full cultural station .	-4.5312
The word game : " Decrypto " in the play sheet	-3.8277
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other .	-3.9892
There is a screen for each page , including four cards with keywords , which can only be deciphered - the old trick with the red slide - once inserted .	-6.5141
This ensures that the other side cannot read by mistake .	-3.6943
On the maps , for example , you can read from left to right : " 1st Renaissance " .	-7.4712
2 .	-2.6148
3 . Dice .	-1.8447
4 . Feast ' .	-1.4505
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on .	-2.7221
It is not the terms that should be guessed here , but codes .	-4.5100
In turn , one player per team is the encoder .	-3.5976
He gets a code card , which might contain " 3.4.2 " .	-4.3345
In " Decrypto " it is not the terms behind the secret film but their encryption codes that should be recommended . are . . are , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.6194
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms " dice " , " feast " and " windows " - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and if possible the opponent team does not , because that will win the game if he can break the code twice .	-7.1134
So the encryption notes and reads out loud : " Werfen " for the dice , " Lose " as a contrast to feast ; here , of course , something like " Party " would be possible and " Prague " because he has looked up at school and knows the windowsill there .	-8.6732
So we go round by round , team by team .	-3.9431
You don 't know the terms of the other side - but you can better reconcile them with any reference the encryption person gives there .	-8.0446
Maybe mysterious , but not to turn off the conversions should be , otherwise you will make it unnecessarily difficult for your team .	-6.2168
The most cryptic thing about " Decrypto " is unfortunately the rulebook .	-3.4451
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time before they can finally play .	-8.2550
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier .	-2.7065
But anyone who has started will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game .	-4.8894
However , " Decrypto " is not as conclusive as the predecessor and genre prism " Codenames " , which is also an agency game that puts fewer words on a game but is much better to play in small groups .	-7.5448
And those who are only talking about rates and not winning points can easily invent a version for two .	-5.9606
Kulmbach : Man shows police Hitler 's greeting and harasss guests in the pub .	-4.3936
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspectorate Kulmbach twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday .	-3.2313
He first showed Hitler 's greeting in the upper town of a passing police strike , then later he also fell in a pub in the upper town when he harassed other guests .	-7.8064
After being considerably alcoholic , he had to spend the night at the police inspectorate in Kulmbach in the prison cell . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.1416

The Pressig factory Home of the Sh	-4.0806
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades .	-3.3057
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended .	-2.5938
" When buffers burst , one heard them all over Pressig , " Georg Dinkel recalls , archiving the history of the place and the train station .	-5.6403
That did not inspire anyone .	-3.4359
The brakes quit and the wagons cracked .	-5.4707
That was pure railways .	-3.8987
Speeches that symbolize Dinkel 's home Pressig .	-4.7315
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railways .	-3.4091
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-Bergstrecke to the north , which has its crossroads in Steinbach am Wald after an increase of about 220 metres .	-5.9234
In order to cope with this , trains and drawers that had their home in Pressig were previously needed .	-6.3961
In 1901 , the Bavarian Parliament approved the construction of a railway plant with 21 locomotives , apprenticeship workshop , steering and railway mastery .	-5.8279
" The centerpiece was the turnstile , which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899 , " says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid , railway historian and 47 years of professional railroad .	-5.3776
The railway company 's headquarters ( BW ) Pressig , which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968 , also operated locomotives for the secondary routes Pressig - Tettau , Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten , Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - northern half .	-5.1651
On July 15 , 1950 , the " Volksblatt " reported a staff of 160 men ; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig .	-4.6044
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for train and rail blocks .	-5.3797
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains .	-3.0767
Until 1991 , at least 10 000 weights were still in place per month .	-4.7067
In 1982 parts of the plant were abandoned , and in 1991 the rest of the plant was abandoned .	-5.6002
Heidrich : ' It is a pity that we did not envisage better use of the site , including with regard to freight transport ' .	-5.3517
At Pfingsten in 1989 , the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous railway festival in Pressig on the anniversary of " 50 years of electrification in Nuremberg - Saalfeld " .	-6.4253
" There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here , " remembers Georg Dinkel .	-2.8228
A little later , the end .	-4.3078
On June 1 , 1991 , the last 30 men were withdrawn , the Pressig Range Railway Station was .	-5.1622
Dinkel recalls , " The Rangiers and Hemmschuhleger did the most difficult work in train traffic .	-7.0741
Any failure would have had fatal consequences .	-2.2360
Why the train station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places , and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article .	-4.5278

He himself has been present since the first hour .	-2.9563
Like Volker Hahn , who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike .	-7.9413
Surprisingly , Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago .	-2.7732
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer , however , he placed his task in tried and tested young hands with a good future perspective .	-3.9539
In the past , both actively participated in the selection of artists and helped shape flyers .	-4.2557
This year again , on the occasion of Art & Genuss , there is a 70-cent special stamp designed by them , available at every art station .	-6.0111
This year 's poster " Dance Betzn " , designed by Volker Hahn , can also be purchased for eight euros .	-4.8060
Hahn was pleased with the high level of support for the special exhibition .	-4.6088
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical setting .	-4.6158
While walking through the spacious garden , the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title " Windplay Performance " formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully .	-5.5310
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic , often with colour accents .	-4.2295
Already at the entrance of the property , the visitor is expected on the right side of the " Glücksbaum " by the artist Werner Baur , Eschenau .	-4.8471
It is a tree stump , brightened in colour , playfully provided with 20 windmills , 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes .	-5.0255
The sun in the background shines through the bush work and makes the object look fairytale and invites you to linger .	-7.1562
Barbara Waschneck , who prefers to dedicate himself to the event 15 years of K & G in three-dimensional letters , comes from Eckental .	-4.0248

50 years MGV 68 Albachts : Singers celebrate 50th birthday .	-3.3535
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement .	-2.1092
And the night-time ones , too , gave way to their displeasure .	-6.3334
At least five of them .	-0.9053
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir " Cäcilia " there should be no more sangesleben in the district .	-5.3597
It has now become a legend : At a bank in the Tinnenbusch , they dubbed the MGV 68 albums .	-8.8230
That was 50 years ago .	-0.9912
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the " Haus der Begegnung " .	-3.7111
" It gets full today , " Chairman Jürgen Holstiege suspected , and he should keep right .	-2.7220
There were 150 guests , a real success for the Albacht singers .	-4.8246
For their anniversary , they had revived the Foundation Festival .	-5.7952
For years it was tradition , then there was a break .	-3.9241
The traditional festival was back on time for the 50th anniversary .	-3.9650
An elegant ball was asked to wear festive clothes had been previously .	-3.5282
The guests did not sit as usual in the " Haus der Begegnung " in rows of seats , but sit comfortably at tables .	-5.0103
In the meantime there was a need for movement : DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled the sliders and asked for the dance floor .	-5.9469
Honorary note that the singers of the MGV made 68 albums sound their own .	-6.0160
Suitable for the occasion were cheerful songs . .	-5.5933
Almost already set : " So a day , as beautiful as today " .	-3.6586
The " Rüdesheim Wine " was the perfect match for the exquisite vine juice many had in front of them .	-6.1096
In reference to another cool drink , " Humulus lupulus " , which is the Latin term for " hops " .	-3.8140
Again sovereign was the choir direction of Richard Homann , who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time .	-4.5686
" It 's just fun to sing under his direction , " Holstiege said : " He has such a lightweight way , it 's a masterpiece he accomplishes " , and this time it 's not just men who are singing .	-7.6734
" Hohes C " was also a guest of the " Damenchor " , whose repertoire includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s .	-6.4145
Finally , there was poetry .	-2.4717
Singer Theo Weber sat at the desk until 3 o 'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes .	-3.6950
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine sounding poetry .	-2.7300
There was also a big raffle .	-2.0320

Volleyball : 3rd League Women : USC II wins high class Derby against BW Aasee .	-3.1919
The uprising marches .	-6.8616
Three games , three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite right in league three .	-3.7007
No trace of shudder or snuff , the independents do their thing .	-6.4196
And this at 3 : 0 ( 25 : 15 , 25 : 23 , 26 : 24 ) against city competitor BW Aasee really good .	-3.7224
" This was not crystal clear , but we have already made an impression , " says the reasonably satisfied trainer .	-4.2472
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed : " This is a defeat with which we can live very well .	-2.9798
We are not dissatisfied ' .	-3.1759
In the evening at an evening of Ronja de Boer ’ s birthday , the mood was good , the game was choked off .	-5.8914
Yes , the result is indeed an optical illusion .	-2.3220
In the third sentence the guests had a sentence .	-3.1267
" If they bring this into the goal , such a game can kick once " , Büring knows from years of experience .	-6.8349
After all , the USC , with its routine forces , made everything clear and brought the full yield to its goal .	-9.0242
" We all know who is on the other side in such a derby .	-3.1646
That does not break our genius .	-3.1113
I saw good volleyball in stages " , Annacker did not hit the 0 : 3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda .	-5.9986
After just three days of play , the journey for the independents does not seem to be foreseeable .	-5.5609
" It 's just too early for that , " says Axel Büring .	-3.1410
Only in one he feels confirmed : " The 3rd league has an unbelievably good level .	-4.4723
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball , " but they no longer want to turn their gaze down into the fourth league anyway .	-7.2792
If the West is not polluted in the next few weeks , they must look up .	-3.3277
However , an initial balance sheet can only be drawn after ten or eleven games .	-8.7697

Her marriage to Hans von Borsody : Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband .	-1.2523
Heide Keller became a star on the " dream ship " .	-2.6658
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series might have been complicit in her marriage to Hans von Borsody .	-5.1087
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the " dream ship " made Heide Keller ( 76 ) famous , but on January 1 , 2018 she went away forever .	-4.1832
The series , which made her star , could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody ( 1929-2013 ) , with whom she was married for ten years .	-3.6823
" That could have been a reason .	-3.0878
Because I grew up with this work , travelled around the world with a suitcase alone , and many of my admired colleagues experienced me on an equal footing , " says Keller in conversation with the " picture on Sunday " .	-5.6415
At first she was always " the wife of Hans von Borsody " , but that changed with the " dream ship " .	-4.0287
For now , the journalists are only calling Heide Keller .	-4.3426
'I do not know if he liked it so well ' .	-4.1366
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been envious , but " how many men did Hans shy away from talking about problems and feelings " .	-5.4469
Keller always tried to be the only right thing for Hans von Borsody and he didn 't want to know my fears , my weaknesses .	-4.1551
That means in plain English : I have hired myself , ' as she further explains .	-6.3638
She always felt " not good enough for him .	-2.4125
He saw me as an emancipated woman , which in reality I never was , even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on stage .	-5.5948
I wanted our love to be forever " .	-1.4678
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner , Keller once again said yes , " although I was afraid it could go wrong a second time " .	-3.2804
The day before the funeral I sat in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything .	-4.7241
The marriage to Borsody also failed .	-8.7391
Why never did it work with men ?	-2.8493
Because I wanted too much .	-0.7940
Keller imagined love then " as in the movie .	-4.0398
Unfortunately , this vision is not suitable for everyday use .	-3.2314
I have approached love far too naively " .	-2.6479
The night falter that regularly explores the night life of the city in the NZZ resort Zurich has dared to attend the ZFF opening party this time .	-5.2239
Our Falter is not a motif , but a little light-hearted .	-4.1732
And the bright shine in which a green carpet is plunged on the hexagonal square overlooks it .	-6.2143
But it ’ s just a film festival , where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight .	-5.0521
So he torches over the square this late Thursday evening to make himself easier in the " Aquaclean-WC Oasis " .	-5.5561
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company , which is celebrating its premiere at the festival : the needy establishment on the ground floor of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to evaporate a luxurious ambience .	-6.6605
This evening , however , the men ’ s oasis smells into heaven for some reason .	-6.6905
So out here , over to the other side of the street : Charmed guests who entertained the opening film " Green Book " right next door to the cinema at the very best level are celebrating the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store .	-7.8603
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival : all over the world , as we know , the works on display come from all over the world .	-5.7069
What do you have to think of when you make an article about this festival in order not to fall into the trap of advertising for its 190 partner companies ?	-7.9676
The wrist binds itself a belt around the feelers , which has put a good fairy on him , and two bullish doormen really wave him in generously .	-8.5602
Inside , the performers rush to live music far after midnight , or can be set by DJ rhythms to which they scream each other , and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite appetizers .	-7.9575
In the delicatessen shop in the souterrain oysters wait for slippery mouths , next to which the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut and a chocolate fountain bubbles .	-6.1795
And the hammer is : all the sales shelves of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion .	-6.0592
This has been the case for years , so it seems to work without great losses .	-3.9556
You have to love this country for it !	-4.9261
The wrist studies the shield on the escalator : " wear a long dress , please be careful on the escalator " .	-5.0913
If this is two separate instructions , he will have lost himself in the dressing code .	-5.9482
But it is more a conditional construction , and it has certainly saved lives .	-3.7116
On the upper floor , poultry dumps a cocktail prepared with espresso called " Golden Eye " , in line with the festival award .	-5.7706
This mix , with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself , does not come at the price of the best drink .	-4.9574
And George Clooney , who has been campaigning for this brand for years , is not here this evening either .	-3.6583
But , between local romance , Kassentisch and kitchen articles , there is a face passing that the observer knows : Peter Farrelly , the director of the opening film .	-6.1113
His main character is probably not far away .	-4.2622
And really : Right now Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd with soon sixty almost acting like a choir .	-4.7608
It is not tarnished , it is not made , at most it is stolen .	-6.6497
It is precisely for this reluctance , often misunderstood as incomprehensibility , that international stars love this festival .	-5.2419
Maradona celebrates Mexico ’ s Victory with Cumbia Dances	-1.8073
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona is pleased to have won his team .	-3.5806
Argentina ’ s soccer legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home , Mexico .	-3.0291
After a 2 : 0 victory by his club Dorados de Sinaloa , the 57 year old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia Rythmen , as shown in a video released on Saturday .	-4.3602
In the 15-second clip of a team member , Maradona dances in the yellow jersey , fired by the players .	-7.1912

Handball : Verbandsliga 1 : ASV Send after last minute failure " destroyed on the ground " .	-2.7280
Swen Bieletzki , Coach of the Handball-Verbandsligist ASV Senden , could hardly believe it : " So a bitter defeat " .	-6.0132
As in Steinhagen and Hüllhorst , they did not play badly over long periods , the Sendeners .	-4.8967
Only the initial phase " we slept completely " , the ASV trainer was annoyed .	-5.1261
The landlords quickly ran at 8 : 1 , even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not yield at first .	-6.4817
" Then suddenly a rush went through the team , " summarized Bieletzki 's second quarter of an hour .	-4.3233
At the break , the backlog was only two goals .	-6.7256
In particular , Senden ’ s Best , Marius Hintze , met again and again in the phase .	-4.7141
After the change it became even better from a visitor 's point of view .	-4.0112
After 33 minutes David Ernst was running for 15 : 15 , then the relay changer almost invariably .	-5.9587
Four minutes before the siren the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits ( 29 : 26 ) .	-3.0115
And then ?	-0.8653
Get the impartial involved .	-3.2675
Bieletzki is usually wary of blaming others .	-3.5888
But : The 120 seconds penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received was " a joke . "	-3.8158
LIT had laughed well and met four times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack .	-3.7318
The guys fought terribly , in the back they also stood well against seven men and threw them onto the empty gate again and again .	-7.4835
But they can buy little for compliments .	-2.0692
" Now a damned victory has to be achieved , " says Bieletzki .	-4.7208

On Saturday , the forces of the armed forces found a road at Marxgrün .	-7.0331
For this purpose , the road surface and several strata were removed , as police and prosecutors jointly announced .	-6.7113
According to new evidence , the missing persons may not have been buried far from where they were .	-4.6742
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986 .	-1.5267
The investigators did not rule out a crime .	-2.5480
Since last year , the Criminal Police Department of the Court , together with the public prosecutor 's office , has , according to the data , been working intensively on the case again .	-6.8137
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority , the investigators found a sensation beneath the road by means of a ground radar .	-5.6231
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones , the officials bordered the job to a few meters .	-6.7948

The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the net .	-3.6735
However , users themselves can also provide additional security .	-2.5868
Instead of complicated letter sequences , users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net .	-3.1928
In addition , security updates , such as for Windows , should be installed quickly , nor does it harm to equip computers with antivirus protection .	-5.9996
Elon Musk , founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla , has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the billionaire company .	-3.8387
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) raised an extrajudicial dispute over misleading Twitter messages , in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies .	-4.7794
As part of the settlement , Musk and Tesla pay $ 20 million each , and Musk resigns as Chairman for three years , a position comparable to that of Germany ’ s chairman .	-5.0334
He may remain CEO .	-2.7241
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct in the comparison , which must be confirmed by a court .	-4.9456

After the break the VfL took full control .	-3.5469
Thewes from 18 meters fell short .	-3.6048
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes entry .	-3.9892
With the intervention of Miles Geske , Fetsch on the left missed another fresh cell show .	-5.4006
When Altenrhein Chris Naberbäumer pulled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute , 18 metres before the guest house , there was an indirect free shot for the placeholders .	-5.9931
The Gefoulte himself stepped up and demonstrated his danger to standards .	-5.4886
Westhues " Thing with the right slip struck in the lower left from the shooter 's point of view - 1 : 0 ( 71 ) .	-4.9248
20 minutes , which should be damned long .	-3.6967

Between April and September the traditional MoGo service takes place on the last Sunday of a month at Haus Nordhelle .	-3.7230
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated in the Peace Church in Eveking .	-3.1569
Around 150 bikers met there on Sunday to perform a service that was anything but normal .	-5.3508
As early as 10 o ’ clock , the bolds were up in front of the entrance gate of the church .	-6.8106
At first the biker loblobe was on the programme and it was possible to fortify itself with coffee and cake or even with a good curry sausage .	-7.0545
In addition to the MoGo team , there were also the Holy Riders , a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach .	-3.1997
The sermon held during the Biker service parish priest Dirk Grzegorek .	-3.2569
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical entertainment .	-4.4781
" Although the bikers prefer blues rock , Valerie Lill ’ s tone is more poetic and calm , " says pastor Frank Schröder .	-5.6787
This , too , was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle services yesterday .	-3.8197
Fechtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big party : After the apple comes the milk .	-4.4832
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action .	-4.0803
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes .	-2.5116
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest .	-2.3160
He had his apple press in his luggage and gradually demonstrated to his astonishing spectators the process from ripe apple to apple juice .	-3.7757
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel .	-2.9701
With a little muscle power , the apples became a finely crushed mass .	-3.0437
Not many of the children could have imagined how to turn this into a tasty drink .	-4.5797
But they were also able to take a look at this important step at this late Friday afternoon .	-4.4304
In forms packed and wrapped by nets , Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple layer for layer , which looks a bit like a debris .	-7.4844
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support , the last step was no longer so difficult .	-4.5423
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel .	-3.0586
But the farmer ’ s fechtorfer also had pre-filled specialties .	-4.6245
He opened his " treasure chest " and presented the latest feather white to older visitors .	-3.8238
The demand for the good drop " Made in Füchtorf " was correspondingly high .	-2.9472
Parents were able to talk in a cosy atmosphere , while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press , but also discovered the erected chimney for themselves .	-7.5517
Also active members of the Fechtorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged themselves during the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games .	-6.8807
In the coming year , the Heimatverein will also offer an action day .	-4.7440
But then , as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out , the home in the heart of the Spargeldorf will not be the place of action .	-4.4056
Instead , a farm will be visited .	-1.3925
This is also clear on the basis of the subject : after all , it will be all about milk .	-5.7841
1 : 4 versus Frankfurt : Hannover with fourth season bust : " Beschissene Situation " .	-2.5117
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat , coach André Breitenreiter gathered together his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 and gave them courage .	-4.8670
However , there were many positive things to be seen at the 1 : 4 ( 0 : 2 ) last table at Eintracht Frankfurt .	-6.3292
" It 's a tough situation , but you have to get out as a team , " said 96-footballer Pirmin Schwegler and went on to say , " This is disappointing , of course , because you always take a lot of action " .	-8.5146
The more victorious Lower Saxony , for which only Florent Muslija ( 86 ) joined , are at the bottom with two meters and are a descent candidate in their current constitution .	-5.0764
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic , Frankfurt celebrated its first season home victory .	-3.6477
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute , Rebic ( 45th + 1 ) , Jonathan de Guzmán ( 59 ) and Luka Jovic ( 89 ) achieved the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators , who scored seven points in the middle of the table after the successful general test for the European League match against Lazio Rome .	-5.9205
Croatia ’ s vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of Hessen during his start debut and never got under control from Hanover ’ s defenses .	-6.8768
The striker , long troubled after the World Cup , showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony .	-5.2455
Alongside Rebic , the Brazilian Allan borrowed from the FC Liverpool was also the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange , which began to grow .	-7.2758
A headball of Lucas Torró ( 17 . ) , adulterated onto the net of the gates , brought danger for the first time .	-6.9227
Six minutes later , Sébastien Haller , in a promising position , was stopped at the last moment by the 96 defensive against Brazilian Felipe , who replaced Kevin Wimmer ( back ) .	-5.5598
Leadership for the carers fell almost inevitably and fully deserved .	-4.1714
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defensive corner into the penalty room , Haller prolonged per head in front of the gate , where Ndicka only had to stop the foot .	-5.9565
It was the first Bundesliga meeting for the defender who came in summer from the French second league player AJ Auxerre .	-5.7633
And Frankfurt performed before the break .	-3.3931
This time Haller adapted to his Sturmpartner Rebic , who skilfully danced through and left Michael Esser no chance .	-6.2684
In the mid-term , Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt .	-3.9906
The Lower Saxony now made a bit more brave progress , but sparking ideas remained until the end , when the finishing line was still successful .	-8.8167
The Hessen were much more efficient .	-2.4815
After a short hour Rebic started a solo and then placed right on De Guzmán , who only had to push the ball into the empty goal .	-5.8255
The rest was only running for the Frankfurt people against overcrowded guests , Jovic also met a minute before the end .	-6.3340
The Morlaian Square becomes a party mile .	-3.4971

Violent Christians Celebrate Holy Cross Feast	-3.7654
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on 14 September or Sunday after .	-3.6374
The festive service takes place in the city church , then there is a procession to the Holy Cross church and the final one .	-6.4517
The Holy Cross Church houses the fired Christ from the Thirty Years War on which , according to legend , a Swedish soldier was shot .	-5.2377
Blood flowed from the gunwound .	-3.1801
This led to a great pilgrimage to the Shrine of Christ , which led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church .	-5.4512
It has not been completed until today , only the altarpiece stands , the missing long house is hinted by the trees .	-7.2744
In his sermon , pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope , comfort and life .	-2.6918
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish , the worship service was poorly attended .	-4.3480
After the worship the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the Cruciended .	-5.4413
For many years now , the Catholic Church choir has been inviting the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish .	-8.7870
The choir members provided visitors with hearty meals as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather , farm ice .	-4.0039
In the afternoon , Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger offered guided tours around the city church . On behalf of the parish , they informed visitors about the damage to the facade , the roof , the sandstone works and windows , as well as the upcoming construction measures , which will continue until next year .	-7.8933
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time , the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more specifically .	-6.1451
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned , because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased , but more has also been discovered , which has only been made possible by scaffolding .	-7.6730
Socket plastering works have been completed , natural stone works are to be started before winter and we hope to be able to complete half of these works this year .	-6.9167
Inauguration : New Home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße .	-6.3086
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home in Münsterblick Street for people with disabilities .	-6.5572
The fact that in Münsterblick Street " a very special house " is now being handed over to his appointment - everyone was agreed at the inauguration date .	-7.0790
After all , the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the home of the life aid Donau-Iller for some time already depend on the special architecture of the new building .	-4.9626
In his concept , architect Rudolf Bader took into account broader corridors , corridors and doors , larger rooms and accessibility for all areas .	-5.0719
The first plans began around eight years ago , when the former US Army officer ’ s building was put on the test bench for the residents with a handycap : “ The house had come into the years and was no longer up to date in terms of equipment , ” said Bader retrospectively .	-7.5530
In 2016 , the excavators moved to dismantle the house .	-3.4407
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible , so that the inhabitants can feel at home in it , according to the architect .	-5.1260
Donau-Iller Opens New Home	-2.8060
About EUR 4.6 million was invested in the new building .	-4.2159
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million , while the district of Schwaben contributed EUR 450000 .	-4.4381
According to architect Bader , the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money .	-4.9055
The Managing Director of Lebenshilfe , Jürgen Heinz , also thanked him for this .	-3.4860
The splitting between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction method was not always easy .	-7.3895
Nevertheless , the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help .	-6.4764
Similarly , Gertrud Kreutmayer , the head of the social administration of Swabia , said : " The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants , who need resources to be mobile " .	-6.1503
Kreutmayer said that living and functionality were well combined .	-4.8910
And again : " The plot in this location is a real stroke of luck because it can no longer be purchased in the current situation " .	-6.3809
In total , the new residential home in Münsterblick Street offers space for 30 people with disabilities , divided into three living groups on almost 1500 square meters .	-7.2274
Heinz , CEO of life aid , is proud of the eleven full-time employees , all of whom are employed by collective bargaining .	-5.3857
Germany ’ s Swede laments East-West Differences	-4.2913
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity , Deputy SPD Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept discrimination against East Germans .	-4.9043
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity .	-2.7399
We cannot be satisfied with these differences , " said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , " Sunday 's miracle " .	-8.2175
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country .	-2.7022
It is unacceptable that , on average , East Germany worked longer than the people of West Germany , but that it would receive 15 % less pay . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.6572
" I can 't explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after German unity , " said Schwesig .	-3.8059
North Korea : Does this putty dog end the Korean conflict ?	-2.3661
The one year old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas .	-4.6715
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul , Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs .	-3.4822
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday , the two dogs , some one year old , already reached their recipients on Thursday .	-4.3799
Thus they passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feed in order to " facilitate the assimilation " of the animals .	-5.1699
The dogs with the thick white coat , pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent .	-2.7071
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .	-1.9332
The North announced its friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang in mid-September .	-3.1020
In doing so , both countries also agreed to join forces in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games , and to work together to host the 2032 Olympic Games .	-4.9310
As Kim approached each other , he also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri missile test facility .	-3.1800
Austria ’ s Moving History in Mirror of 99 Documents	-1.9354
What is Austria ?	-0.4030
On the 100th anniversary of the Republic , which has been celebrated for nearly ten months this year , numerous new books have been published , which answer this question mostly in retrospect to the past hundred years .	-6.0969
Wolfgang Maderthaner , historian and general manager of the Austrian State Archive , makes a very different point in the magnificent picture book Austria , which will be published on 1 October .	-5.4931
New Week , New Opportunity for Government	-1.4462
Back to the subject matter , that is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition , which is beginning today .	-5.5165
Hardly an interview , hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU , the SPD and also from the CSU did not last mantra the " return to factual work " .	-5.3344
This may have led some craftsmen , doctors , cashiers and other working people in that country to ask the legitimate question of what the difference is between work and work , but so be it .	-6.2250
Now that the federal government is ready to return to its mission - governance - it should not be stopped by talking about concepts .	-5.8797
Monday will probably show whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks .	-5.0910
In the evening , the leaders of the governing parties will meet for the coalition committee .	-3.6141
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early ; a lesson from all this dispute .	-3.2739
First of all , however , the issue of diesel upgrades and the law on the migration of skilled labour is once again the subject of conflict .	-6.4748
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with exchange-rate premiums , while the SPD and CDU see manufacturers as obliged to retrofit older diesel engines .	-6.5112
While the diesel crisis has seen an approximation over the weekend , the EU and the SPD are still far apart from the proposed legislation on skilled labour migration .	-6.6719
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is calling for a perspective for those who have not received asylum , who are working or are training .	-10.1506
The Union is firmly opposed to the ' change of track ' from the asylum system to the labour market .	-3.3120
So there will again be disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be otherwise ?	-4.1098
It was not the same thing that joined forces to form the GroKo , but three partners , some of them with very different social images and priorities .	-7.3697
Dispute is good .	-1.4699
Without dispute , a society characterised by such diverse and sometimes conflicting interests is not progressing .	-4.8606
In order to be constructive , however , disputes must not be re-established for party-political reasons on the question of being or .	-4.9902
It is still a matter of politics , not theatre .	-2.7931
The Union and the SPD are to argue , but always bear in mind the reality of people 's lives .	-5.1489
What is feasible and beneficial to many ?	-2.2750
With this key question , both the diesel and the track change issue can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence .	-5.6755
That , above all , is what the People 's Party must now fight for .	-4.1047
Pilz Checks Working Time at Hartinger	-1.5036
Minister in Vision	-2.6471
Does the Minister for Employment in particular violate the law of service in force ?	-5.1942
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this .	-2.2593
" Really day and night " their legalists had been working on social security reform , a lavish Social Minister reported when they presented it two weeks ago .	-6.2311
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger , the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein ( FPÖ ) is astonished - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question .	-4.3853
She assumes that ' the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and never to declare infringements of current service rights before cameras ' .	-7.7860
Nevertheless , she now has questions in order to ' free from any suspicion ' .	-5.8343
Police Rides a Street in Search of Women ’ s Equ	-4.4909
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this .	-4.4855
Now there is confirmation .	-1.8096
Since early Saturday morning , the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug .	-3.5316
The course is closed until Monday in the Marxgreen area .	-4.2691
It was assumed that the investigators had previously set up an archaeology store .	-5.5221
The dog , specially trained for the smell of old human bones , together with his guide , was able to limit the relevant position to a few metres in several times .	-6.3097
In addition , a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the supreme Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the above-road .	-7.4022
For more than a year now , prosecutors and criminal police department Hof have been dealing with the missing person .	-5.6251
Time and again , a cycle path was closed at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar devices , because the investigators suspect that in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago Heike 's body might have been buried .	-8.0229
Colour powder and eggs : riots in Barcelona before Catalonia ’ s Anniversary	-3.7020
Monday marks the first anniversary of the disputed independence referendum in Catalonia .	-2.4664
But riots are already occurring .	-2.5453
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017 .	-2.4139
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1 , 2017 , separatist and police clashes took place in the centre of Barcelona .	-3.8895
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence campaigners with , among other things , paint powders to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard .	-5.0853
Some 3,000 officials from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police forces wanted to honour their colleagues who were in action last year in the polling stations in the referendum that was deemed illegal .	-6.9191
Violence had also occurred at the time in trying to prevent citizens from voting .	-4.2779
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep separatist demonstrations and the central security forces separate , Spanish media reported .	-4.1894
However , some of the 6000 or so separatists would then have been violent in trying to break the police chain and , among other things , threw the officials with colour bags and eggs .	-6.9066
Six people were arrested , 24 more were slightly injured , and the authorities were invoked .	-4.7676
Monday is the first anniversary of the independence referendum .	-1.7443
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain , the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under coercion in the fall of 2017 .	-3.6046
The then regional president , Carles Puigdemont , fled exile to Belgium .	-2.4861
Other politicians also resigned abroad .	-3.3115
On the other hand , several ministers from the then regional government and other activists from the separatist movement remain in underground detention .	-4.1950
New elections had been held in the region in December .	-1.5043
After the new Catalan Government took office in May , the forced administration was brought to an end .	-3.5020
But the new regional president , Quim Torra , also insists on the ' right to self-determination ' of Catalans .	-2.7299
Football : Oberliga Westfalen : Versammelte Ratlosigkeit : FC Gütersloh und RW Ahlen trennen sich torlos .	-9.1352
Red and white Ahlen continues on the spot .	-3.2043
FC Gütersloh also won a 0 : 0 draw .	-4.8603
The rear lights and the third final turned out to be a jolly joke before 438 spectators in the Heidewald stadium .	-7.5251
The first half was scarcely manageable from the entertainment factor .	-3.7207
Those who would prefer to have a beer or a bratwurst could do so safely .	-5.7993
There was no risk of missing a chance of goalkeeper , because there were virtually none .	-5.4222
First Shot After Half an Hour	-3.4585
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first ( harmless ) shot of the entire game in the 28th minute .	-4.0771
The best - and , in principle , the only real - possibility was for the Ahlener , when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the border .	-6.3527
Even more harmless were the hosts .	-2.0889
Their most effective action was an early change .	-2.6039
For him , Sinan Aygün had to be exchanged due to .	-6.8937
After the change , both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom .	-3.0580
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters narrowly targeted over the housing and after an hour , the Gütersloher also appeared offensive for the first time .	-7.5813
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz it was fixed .	-3.1001
The swiftly presented account about Sinan Aygün " crowned " Nick Flock ( 62 . ) with a small shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann .	-4.2213
They also played with a Wieckowicz headball ( 66th ) after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein .	-4.7935
RWA Interimstrainer Angelo Daut reacted , initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy ( 60 ) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel ( 70 ) .	-2.6696
It did nothing .	-2.6546
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative , the Ahlener did not succeed .	-4.4526
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance , but neither did it .	-4.6185
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive : ' I like the fact that we played at zero ' , but unfortunately the zero was in the front .	-6.8692
" This time we were not as dangerous as we were against woodwind and although our opponent had no desire to play here , " stated RW Ahlens Interimstrainer .	-5.8207
Offensively , " everything so called a bit " against a team that only wanted to defend .	-5.9952
In any case , I did not feel that we could get a countertor , " Daut said .	-4.1391
But , to his grief , spectators did not feel that his team could score a goal .	-6.0152
The idea was too weak for this .	-9.0481
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt : Fortunately , there are enough Kreimers .	-2.4929
Brigitte Ransmann , Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Board of Directors , for whom these donations are intended , are delighted .	-3.9458
The volunteers assure : " These donations remain in Reckenfeld " .	-3.5688
At the opening the sky was shining blue , but the space was still a little empty , but that should change during the day .	-6.2941
Because , " Here it is so nice sociable , that 's why we are here today , " said a visitor .	-4.8376
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus greeted the guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper touch of humor .	-8.5432
For the couple Brockmann , who was supposed to be weighed up against food , Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer quickly jumped in .	-5.0943
Verena ( daughter of Ferdi Kreimer ) has become ill .	-6.4004
But there are enough Kreimers .	-1.9208
And the " replacement " could not be taken to entertain the increasing number of visitors in between .	-5.4815
This was so good that at the late hour some folk songs were sung .	-4.8303
" Simply great " , Marcel Kreimer was delighted .	-2.9626
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to include the opening date in his schedule this time .	-3.1336
He is pleased about the many active people with their stands , mostly clubs .	-4.9677
" Actually , there should be no such thing as a table , " he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir .	-4.3543
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those in use at the booths and also included the other celebrations and the " Clean up " action that took place in September .	-5.3849
Our garden town gives itself a colorful painting - here you can do something .	-5.2747
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd took the Maikranz with the help of the fire brigade and brought it to the winter quarters .	-4.6521
Many stands were used for the physical well-being .	-4.0932
From sweet to heartfelt everything was to be had .	-3.5229
Stefan Hagemeyer , who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year , became creative on his decorative saw .	-3.8550
He offered veneer work , beer lid with reckenfelder motifs and much more .	-7.9399
Three Reckenfelder beekeepers offered a specialty : " Reckenfelder Honig " , brought with them by Maria-Theresia Smolka , Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter .	-3.4252
The latter has a speciality in it .	-3.4615
Honey cake in glass , of course with honey from my own production .	-2.3783
There the little elsa had to access again and again , so well tasted the cake .	-5.1847
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to linger for a long time until the evening hours , even without a stage programme that is not available at the autumn festival .	-6.4516
Lubricants with a local political message : No successful advertising for skating equipment	-6.1687
In Lengerich , unknown people have scarcely promoted the construction of a skatepark .	-5.2814
In several places there are corresponding lubricants , says Jürgen Kohne of the City Council on request of the WN .	-4.9015
In at least one case , the police have been prosecuted for damage to property .	-3.3825
In large letters the three words " Skatepark für Lengerich ! " on signs , among others , at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Town Hall .	-5.4177
Michael Rottmann , Manager of the Halle , reports that a corresponding letter has already been discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro after the trade fair on 19 September .	-5.6083
Since the short message was apparently left " only " with a edding , it could easily be removed .	-5.3927
" A few days later , however , that was back , this time sprayed up , " says Rottmann .	-5.1684
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced .	-3.8720
A special feature of this particular case is the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board .	-5.9204
If the skatepark is built , the realisation of the skatepark will also be made possible by sponsors .	-5.4157
There have already been commitments , says Jörg Hesselmann of the municipal sector of education , sport and culture , without mentioning names .	-5.9209
However , it may well be that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the scaled table .	-6.3824
Local politics and administration have been working on the subject of skating for years .	-4.3186
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic , the search for an alternative location began after some time .	-4.7018
Finally , the majority of the Council was in favour of the fire-fighting car park .	-4.2972
However , this request was not implemented - too many factors seem to have spoken out against construction at this point .	-6.0050
At the end of June , a U-turn followed .	-2.4240
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School premises .	-7.3637
Jürgen Kohne says , as things stand , that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning .	-4.3563
The city council then has the last word .	-3.8560
It is based on a decision this year so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built .	-4.0514
Air traffic congestion is getting worse .	-4.4746
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer , German air traffic controllers see no sign of improvement next year .	-3.0966
" This year we had wind , in 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm , " said the chief of the trade union of air traffic control , Matthias Maas , the German press agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg .	-12.5546
An important reason for the many delays and flight failures is the long-known shortage of European air traffic control personnel , for which there is no quick solution .	-5.8770
" Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year , but training new pilots takes four to five years , " said the trade unionist .	-3.6205
Across Europe , the market for fully trained pilots is empty .	-3.3009
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone , around one hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace .	-6.4312
Maas once again criticised the fact that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit .	-3.2868
In the Hanseatic City , representatives of the federal government , countries , air traffic control , airlines and airports meet on Friday to address the causes of delays .	-4.1390
" If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime , this will not happen without us , " explained the head of the GdF , who has many members of the German Air Safety Agency .	-6.3494
Maas once again blamed EU Commission regulations for the plight of pilots .	-3.9230
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 have been far too low .	-3.1631
The resulting costs and personnel savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully integrated into the operational business .	-4.9947
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer ( CSU ) to work in Brussels for regulations which " do not cut off the air even further " .	-6.5213
At the moment , the EU ’ s targets would be agreed by 2024 , and there are fears of further tightening .	-5.4247
The EU has been subject to constant pressure from airlines .	-2.0676
" Ryanair boss Michael O 'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sowed in recent years , " Maas said .	-3.9272
He hopes that the high costs of airline delays will lead to a change of thinking .	-5.2833
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if the German Air Force ( DFS ) offers a " coherent training and future pact " , said Maas .	-4.4720
The record of 120 pilotage buyers per year over the next five years , which has been announced so far , is just enough to compensate for age-related reductions .	-6.5751
The need to build up staff is not linked to this .	-4.9463
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Consolidated Renewal	-3.0977
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans to restructure the Group .	-2.9753
According to Thyssenkrupp interim director Guido Kerkhoff , who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at the meeting on Sunday , the critical group is to be split into two independent companies .	-5.1522
Both companies should be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange .	-2.4483
There should be no further reduction in staff than we already know of cuts in administration .	-4.7426
After two resignations , the control panel on the capital side counts only eight heads .	-2.6602
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this .	-3.3971
However , the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020 .	-2.3492
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata .	-3.5701
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG , the business is to be bundled with elevators and suppliers .	-7.3634
Barcelona : Violence at demos of police and Catalan supporters of independence .	-2.9996
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan pro-independence activists in Barcelona resulted in violent clashes with many injured .	-4.7094
According to the city administration , around 3000 police from all over Spain gathered on Saturday , as well as some 6,000 pro-independence protesters .	-5.8445
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protests from each other with a big bang .	-5.3322
According to the forces , however , advocates of independence repeatedly tried to break the security barrier .	-5.0516
They would have attacked officials with colour and shooting .	-4.0051
According to the data , there were also rankings among the participants in the various protests .	-5.6121
According to rescue forces , 24 people were injured .	-2.2396
The police said there had been six arrests .	-2.4214
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues	-3.6423
The police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who , almost exactly one year ago , had opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia banned by the Spanish central government .	-5.4902
At the same time , they demanded better salaries .	-1.8920
Members of the Spanish police and the Civil Guard find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn far more than they earn .	-4.1911
The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona , of all places .	-3.6285
" Why did they come here to protest ? " asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency .	-2.7131
Just to provoke and to celebrate the fact that they spoiled us a year ago .	-3.5526
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands , who only wanted to give his name to Daniel , dismissed the accusation .	-7.5733
" Of course , we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year : defend the law , " he said .	-3.0334
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona , because it is a great European city and there is more echo here .	-4.0873
He and his colleagues , however , had " not come to provoke , " the policeman assured .	-4.3788

Football : Juve trainers praise Ronaldos best game .	-7.5870
The Portuguese star player " played the best match this evening together with the half hour of Valencia " , praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3 : 1 ( 1 : 1 ) victory of the record master against the SSC Naples .	-5.3301
For the trainer , the prize-winning star , even without his own goal , was the decisive man in the important game against the chase .	-6.6753
" Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well , " said Allegri .	-2.8176
Even if we started with tactical mistakes , Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown .	-4.8211
Thanks to Ronaldo ’ s three goal templates , Juve shot the game after the early lap through the hit of Dries Mertens ( 10 minute ) and suspended the hardest chase for the time being .	-6.9996
The Torjäger , who was brought by Real Madrid , first set up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic , who took the lead with a double pack ( 26th / 49th ) .	-7.3758
And Ronaldo , after a corner by a headball , did the preliminary work for the hit of defender Leonardo Bonucci ( 76 . ) , who just had to push in just before the goal line .	-8.1441
" He gives many templates , " the coach praised .	-2.7628
However , Allegri also wants to see the gates of the attacker , who is the record defender in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team .	-4.2626
" We need to be even better at serving him , " the coach asked .	-6.4649
Best Juve Torturer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account .	-3.1542
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than EUR 100 million , Juventus ’ overpower seems to be even more overwhelming .	-4.1554
Seven wins in seven games in the series A. At 21 points , the master of the last seven years already has six points ahead of Naples .	-9.5908
The second table , trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti , was not without chance against Turin .	-4.1735
But at the latest after the seat of Mario Rui ( 58 ) , who had already been warned , the top part was decided .	-6.4834
The Portuguese had to get too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the place .	-4.9259
" We played well against a good Naples , " commented the Turin coach .	-2.7786
Emre Can was also able to feel this mentioned .	-4.5940
The German national player has won Juve .	-4.0113
The FC Liverpool professional was in use in all seven league matches .	-5.3614
The midfielder also played in the championship league match against Valencia , which Allegri meant " half an hour " : Ronaldo had flown out of the course at the 2 : 0 tournament victory and was closed for the home match against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday .	-7.9336
Kanye West Changes its Name	-1.0245
Rapper Kanye West made a particularly bizarre appearance at the US TV show " Saturday Night Live " at the weekend .	-5.0637
Among other things , his performance together with Lil Pump in a bottom-water costume caused eyebrows and question marks among viewers .	-6.5873
In addition , the 41-year-old announced a change of name on time for the release of his new album . , the . , the , . , , , , , ,	-8.9660
From now on , it may only be called " Ye " , according to the musician .	-5.6539
" The being formerly known as Kanye West , " he tweeted in the words of the late singer Prince when he surrendered his artist name .	-5.8094
But the pseudonym is not news .	-1.8992
Already the tenth album was released under this name .	-2.7520
In an interview with the radio station KRRL , the artist explained that " Ye " had a religious meaning for him .	-2.8219
" I think " Ye " is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means " you " , according to Rapper .	-2.8206
Football : Kreisliga A1 Münster : Finally !	-2.0110
Enough !	-3.6607
Hoetmars coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment .	-2.7537
That was a weak game today .	-3.4044
The opponent was easier to handle , we almost never faced him with problems " .	-6.2255
Grade by two chances of goal in 90 minutes , so you can rarely design games positively .	-7.7828
Football League A1 : SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0 : 2 ( 0 : 1 ) photo : Heinz Schwackenberg	-2.8261
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage , the first but used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early guided tour ( 7th ) .	-5.8587
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have increased , but after great preparatory work by Krause he moved away .	-5.8404
The hosts had only a double option when Moritz Höne first failed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and found his master in the sequel Jan Blome in the Sendenhorster Keeper .	-5.0099
After the break , the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances .	-3.1736
But Uphus ( 49 ) , Julian Turl ( 61 , ) and Heinz Linnemann ( 59 ) all awarded .	-2.9058
In addition , Niklas Eilmann could not use a trade metre - Louis Kortenjann had rescued with his hand on the line of the gate and saw red for that - ( 75 ) .	-6.4768
It was only when Nils Berheide stoned the ball over the line that the match was decided ( 81 ) .	-4.0519
" We had criticised ourselves hard beforehand , that was different today than in recent weeks , " said Florian Kraus .	-5.6289
Sendenhorst : J. Schomacher - Linnemann , Scholz , Eilmann , Mey , Kraus , Krause ( 77th Berheide ) , L. Hartleif , Uphus , Abu Dalal ( 90th Leibig ) , Turl .	-2.0857

Football : Kreisliga A2 Münster : Spectacle Football in Albachten : GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3 : 4 .	-2.7894
" I don 't know what to think of it , " he said .	-4.0668
" We didn 't get any access to them at all " , he presumably meant the wing-pinch with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger , but also all the other green whites who performed with a collective offensive urge .	-8.0122
He was still laughing : " A dirty victory , " he said , sniffed and pulled from his players the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points .	-8.0428
Remember , after a duel of two teams , one of which , namely albums , is playing for the championship and the other , Albersloh , is fighting for class content .	-5.9803
With understandably mixed feelings GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him .	-2.5771
" That was by far our best season performance , " he says .	-2.6472
" How we come back after the 0 : 2 , how we stand against one of the top teams of the league over the entire season , that was really phenomenal " .	-6.5476
This makes it all the more bitter that you have to drive home with empty hands .	-3.9587
Top Torhunter Lars Zymner led the host with his 12th season match ( 24 ) .	-4.2576
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal .	-3.3143
He put the 2 : 0 on the left side as a model for Fabian Fröhning ( 39 . ) .	-4.6284
We knew that , but you can ’ t get rid of such a player completely .	-6.4099
" That was madness what he did , " Lewandowski envied the quality of the opponent .	-5.1021
Shortly before the change of sides , his own elf struck the balance : McGills Freistoß sailed from the left between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe to the long Toreck ( 45 ) .	-5.4420
After the side change it was McGill who scored the match again ( 59 ) .	-5.7674
Then it went back and forth .	-2.8383
It was a crunchy , action-packed game .	-2.0513
Nübel shocked albums again ( 64 ) , only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann turned out ( 69 ) .	-5.1007
Despite the large number , Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia hit ( 80th ) again .	-5.9278
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday .	-2.1319

Musikkabarett : Gender understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten	-4.0717
" Suitable for both adults and men " was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck .	-5.6641
As a cabaret singer , Teubner imagined gender understanding , not only with humour and warmth of heart for the ( felt ) woman and the ( felt ) man and what else might exist , but also with music .	-6.4454
The mini guitar used it and also mastered her violin .	-3.7327
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing .	-1.8927
On the one hand he is the male sparring partner , who sometimes speaks up to the end of the sentence , and on the other he is a true pianist : as congenially harmonically accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo .	-6.3604
This was also the case , with Beethoven and Chopin , but different , in the way it suited the theme of the evening .	-6.3164
There was a paradox in Teubner ’ s play : happiness comes from man when he has a partner , but she doesn ’ t open the door .	-6.7466
A closed door without a partner , on the other hand , will not benefit .	-4.1029
The piano soloist now demonstrates the same thing : What would have come out of composing Mozart had " the Nannerl " opened the door unexpectedly ?	-4.3600
Thus Süverkrüp glides over into improvisations , from Bach 's " O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden " into the " Lied vom Tod " , and from Mozart 's g-minor symphony into a playful dance .	-4.4285

The ASG therefore went almost to the end behind a backlog , was behind the break at 11 : 12 and later at 15 : 18 ( 45 ) .	-6.4531
It was only towards the end that the broader bank of the hosts had a decisive impact .	-5.0970

" This was a giant step for a cool season .	-2.4912
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the league .	-2.9833
This is what we have done , " coach Dominik Münch was pleased to see his team perform almost impeccably at the overthrown table leader .	-7.4045
The guests dominated the first passage almost at will .	-4.1507
Over 4 : 1 , 16 : 10 , and 22 : 12 , he went to the runner-up of the previous year at 25 : 15 .	-3.5753
Essen was accepted in the two-pronged seal but did not come into play .	-5.8232
We did it well .	-2.7830

In the second sentence the BSV already led at 12 : 8 . " Essen has converted its acceptance to triples .	-6.3070
We were unable to keep the pressure on the service .	-4.6758
Food was sucked and we were lulled a bit , " Münch continued .	-5.4067
At 18 : 17 , the first volleyball players from the Ruhr region had their nose ahead .	-5.1398
Although Ostbevern resisted four records at 19 : 24 , the fifth attempt was his goal .	-7.5032
" The game was now a class better " , the tutor was at an increasing level .	-5.6700
Maike Rüdingloh and , finally , Wiebke Silge , played a major role in ensuring that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14 : 16 to 25 : 21 .	-5.3253

The Turkish community in Germany ( TGD ) has criticized the way Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib mosque in Cologne .	-2.7007
" The opening of the mosque in Cologne left behind a shaft in German-Turkish relations , which can only be tediously swept together , " said the chairman of TGD , Gökay Sofuoglu , the German editorial network .	-6.5585
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the opportunity to make a joint , conciliatory appearance .	-3.2172
" Instead of emphasizing , side by side with German leaders , Muslims ’ affiliation with Germany , Erdogan used the date for his purposes , " said Sofuoglu .	-5.3753
The widespread exclusion of the German public has ' reinforced many reservations ' .	-2.9292

On September 29 , 1893 , a fruit show in Kulmbach ’ s Vereinshaus was the last start-up impulse for the district association for horticulture and regional care in Kulmbach , and exactly 125 years later , on Saturday evening , he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle .	-6.9252
In 1893 he was baptized by mayor Wilhelm Flessa .	-5.3227
The purpose of the fruit growers ' association was different from today 's work - in fact , it was purely about fruit growing , about flowers and horticulture no one thought at that time .	-7.6630
" At that time , in the Age of Enlightenment , the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites , " said Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his festive lecture .	-8.8230
Fruit trees should be along long-distance roads , and so-called industrial gardens were built in schools .	-5.8307
Fruit growing is still the job of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach , which comprise almost 7000 members .	-5.9142
But the spectrum is far from exhausted .	-1.6745
Natural horticulture , biological plant protection , village decoration and nutrition play as much a role as providing knowledge , a healthy diet and youth work .	-5.0658
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group " Maulwürfe " showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are .	-4.5853
" Youth work is urgently needed , especially in the digital age , " said District Chairman Günter Reif , and OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature are for life .	-4.4708

Schramm promised to plant two trees together with councillor Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary .	-3.0105
" Where they should stand , the district association decides " , supplemented councillor Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the gardening associations for the villages .	-6.2528
The district association stands for ecology , the beauty of the garden and green areas in the village .	-3.8633
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county left no doubt about this .	-5.9804
He led the many visitors through the long history of the circle and reported , among other things , the need for self-sufficiency after the war .	-5.3495
In the past everything came out of the garden , for winter it was dosed .	-5.5496
At the end of the 1950s , however , the commercial garden turned into a decorative and residential garden .	-4.7946
" Nature has endured , it was here before us and we have to orient ourselves to it , " said the expert for fruit and nut trees .	-6.2248
That is why the gardening associations are encouraged not to let go , so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living .	-6.2354
The President of the Bavarian National Association , Wolfram Vaitl , supplemented this by welcoming the new citizens to our clubs .	-5.2740
" We have to stop the glaring decline in insects , we owe it to our children and grandchildren , " Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony , which was solemnly framed by the towers of the music association Thurnau .	-4.9533

Rocknacht in the Shoe Factory : Volume of pressure hammer level	-4.5394
The band names of " Here We Stand " , " Tiger Bonesaw " and " The Ignition " simply describe the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik : Hardrock pur by three bands with a friend .	-6.7885
After the soundcheck and just before the concert starts , the musicians even take time for a group photo .	-4.0848
No trace of lamp fever .	-2.7087
After that , the rock protagonists from Ahlen and its surroundings - all together with the booking agency " Mosquito " from Oelde - with their bands vocify the approximately 120 visitors of the " Mint Mosquito " -Rocknacht .	-5.9060
Already the quartet " Tiger Bonesaw " with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince with the latest , unknown pieces from his own pen and the forthcoming CD .	-4.8933
In front of the stage , the band will perform in a harmonious and powerful manner .	-6.6340
Although " Admittance " calls are not to be missed , " Tiger Bonesaw " then left the stage to the trio " Here We Stand " .	-4.2740
The fact that Hardrock is not the same hardrock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn , Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds , sometimes reminiscent of classical rock from the 1970s .	-4.7280
After the " High Energy Rock " of the " Tigers " a synthesizer is also used at " Here We Stand " in addition to the guitar .	-3.6561
Not only the longing , ball-loving " Take Me Home " captivates by the change of melodic passages to the gitar-loaded rockriffs of the multi-layered songs .	-6.4348
The quartet " The Ignition " from Tönnishäuschen , however , has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005 .	-4.6933
On Saturday , the band presents their hardrock with full agility .	-4.9802
The fact that " The Ignition " has special stage experience with her appearances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable .	-5.6650
In cooperation with the band , singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in the only covered song of the evening , " Word Up " by Cameo from the 80s .	-5.4627
In the meantime , guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo while he runs through the audience .	-7.0473
A certain volume is of course a part of this kind of hardrock concert : The Mint Mosquito - Rocknacht , according to the information of the mixing desk team , lies at around 98 decibels at the three-volume concert of " Here We Stand " , " Tiger Bonesaw " and " The Ignition " .	-7.7340
This is about pressure hammer level , but is therefore clearly below the " Wacken-Fesitval " , the " The Ignition " on its website .	-7.0436
Ear-stunned 120 decibel in nozzle level , as usual in the annual Metal-Stelldichein in the north of the republic , the Ahlener audience does not need this rocknight .	-8.0570
After just under four hours , the three bands of the harder , rocky Gangart have long convinced with their sovereign , virtuoso play and their own compositions .	-5.3163
" Here we stand , have taken the bone saws and lit a concert table with the power of a tiger , " all three groups can say at the end , albeit in a figurative sense .	-5.9563

A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim / Essen Airport .	-2.4855
As the " Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung " reports , a glider plane had crashed at the airport 's exhibition park .	-4.5324
The pilot was killed .	-7.0521
As the " WAZ " reports , the student was alone on board - the pilot is supposed to be a one-seater .	-5.2372
The aircraft was already landing at the time of the accident .	-3.6279
The crash site is only a short distance away from a tent on the airport grounds .	-4.5210
But an October festival has been taking place since this weekend .	-2.4646

Trump blames Kim : " And then we fell in love . "	-2.6121
It is no secret that US President Kim , North Korea ’ s leader , is well-disposed despite the nuclear crisis .	-4.2879
But Trump has now made a real declaration of love for his colleague .	-3.5348
It also has to do with Kim ’ s “ beautiful letters . ”	-2.8938
At the tender age of 72 , the married US president has committed himself to a new flame .	-2.8088
The tragedy : it is a distant relationship .	-2.2901
In public , Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Saturday .	-2.7094
In front of supporters in West Virginia , Trump found almost timid words for the half-year-old Pyongyang dynasty ’ s ruling dynasty , even though the struggle for North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament turns out to be rather tough .	-6.8969
" I was tough , he was , and between us , " Trump reported .	-4.9002
And then we fell in love .	-0.9270
Okay ?	-0.9959
No , really .	-1.5374
And it is not only talks with Kim that would have melted his heart .	-3.2959
He wrote wonderful letters to me , they were great letters .	-3.0233
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit : Trump has referred to the Kim announcement that all nuclear and missile tests will be stopped , even if critics so far pay little more than lip service to them .	-5.5297
The US president seemed well aware that affection for the infamous " Rocket Man " – Trump ’ s nickname for Kim – of his Martial threatening gesture might not be affectionate to everyone .	-6.1847
In any case , when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling , he immediately anticipated the expected criticism : " Donald Trump says they fell in love . "	-6.0973
How terrible , how terrible is this ?	-2.0725
That is so unpresidential .	-2.2626
But don ’ t care much about it , Trump declared , and put his finger on the crowd : “ I have always told you , it ’ s so easy to be presidential . ”	-5.6635
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there pushing into this bumpy arena ; we would only have 200 people out .	-5.6050

Approximately 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been returned to their homes this year with the help of the program , said the IOM spokesperson in the West African country , Jorge Galindo .	-4.1731
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of Libya ’ s poor prison conditions .	-3.3032
But he didn 't hear about a call for help from a mobile phone video .	-7.5524
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libya ’ s refugee camps as degrading .	-6.6010

Laschet Calls on the Rule of Law in Turkey	-2.2128
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet ( CDU ) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , according to his own .	-3.5668
The two countries ’ relations are currently “ overshadowed , ” Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport .	-3.5533
This concerns , in particular , waves of arrests , freedom of the press and freedom of religion .	-3.4005
So he made it clear to Erdogan that , if relations are to normalize in the future , if economic relations are to be deepened , the rule of law is a very important precondition for this .	-9.5400
Laschet also referred , according to his own data , to the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey .	-3.9090
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected .	-1.9801
Erdogan then reaffirmed the independence of Turkey ’ s judiciary .	-3.1080
Laschet ’ s and Erdogan ’ s conversation had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence ’ s readiness to fly at Cologne ’ s airport in the short .	-6.7784
Originally , it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn , but the owners of the castle rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan .	-5.9004
Erdogan continued to travel after the conversation to open the Ditib mosque in Cologne .	-3.5960
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building .	-3.3299
However , he said : ' The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country ' .	-3.1612
We are also their interlocutors - and not the Turkish President .	-5.1539
North Korea ’ s Demand for Disarmament	-2.5324
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the gains in negotiations on North Korea ’ s denuclearization , the East Asian regime is more sober .	-4.2520
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington to be accommodated .	-2.4626
North Korea ’ s Secretary of State , Ri Yong Ho , accused the US government in the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula with its continued sanctions .	-4.3046
" The recent gridlock comes because the US relies on coercive measures that kill confidence building , " said Ri in New York .	-3.8868
Disarmament would be unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances .	-6.7626
" Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to disarm ourselves , " the North Korean chief diplomat said .	-4.2792
The fact that punitive measures could ' bring North Korea to its knees ' is ' a dream of people who do not know us ' .	-4.0345
In order to build trust , however , his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear testing facility , Ri emphasised .	-4.1056
However , the US side did not react to this , the Minister criticized it .	-6.4804
Last year alone , because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program , the UN Security Council adopted three times sanctions against the internationally isolated country .	-7.8537
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State , Mike Pompeo , have pressed the United Nations in recent days for strict compliance with the sanctions .	-4.2586

The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen .	-4.4313
The institution was funded by donations from the community , for which the young people wanted to thank them for their food .	-4.9276
The launch with the new facility was not exactly easy , as Henriette Westbuer , the head of the HoT , remembers .	-4.3385
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day .	-4.3965
But then the bad surprise came on the first day after the summer break : a power failure had put the huge , two-part refrigerator out of operation , the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of .	-5.7094
" Now we had to start again from scratch : we have had a lot of support from friends and neighbours , but the children and young people wanted to do it alone , " says Westbuer .	-5.3585
And so everyone wrapped up .	-2.6056
The result could be seen , the guests were enthusiastic .	-3.9358
" You can 't do better " , a visitor impressed , while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served , or guests were allowed to use quiz , liver cheese or cake .	-5.9649
" It 's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet , " said pastor Frank Beckmann , while wizard Stephan Lammen was astonished with card tricks and other tricks .	-6.1508

Sartor once again criticized colleagues from other panels in the " World on Sunday " .	-3.9495

SPD politician : Johannes Kahrs marries his friend	-2.5647

On Saturday the two of them gave their backing in Hamburg .	-7.2575
Kahrs had previously told the " Bild " newspaper that a registered life partnership was not in question for them .	-6.0409
" If we marry , then right , " he has been with his partner for 25 years .	-4.2108
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman for the SPD Bundestag Group and one of the spokespersons for the Seeheimer district , the conservative SPD wing .	-4.3165
In the Bundestag ’ s debate on opening marriage to homosexuals , Kahrs had stirred up anger on June 30 , 2017 .	-4.6267
For example , he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) of having " disengaged " .	-4.9302
" This was your Schabowski moment , " he said in reference to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski .	-3.6480
Since October 1 , 2017 , same-sex couples , like heterosexuals , have been able to marry .	-2.2991

There was a lot of work to be done in front of the members of the Citizens ' Association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy .	-4.4382
Around 400 metres of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut .	-3.9350
Supported by the inhabitants , it was put in place for around twelve supporters .	-5.0487
" We do this in order to reduce costs , " explained the chairman of the citizens ' association Walter Schröer .	-4.0596
And so much has accumulated .	-2.9227
Due to the hot summer we are late this time , but fortunately it is now only a form cut .	-4.9827
After all , the hecks were already shot in the spring .	-5.6390
The breakfast , which is always followed , has a long tradition .	-5.7855
" After all , everyone should be able to do their best , " said Walter Schröer .	-5.8931

On Sunday , the 29-year-old placed a perfect run on the Olympic circuit .	-4.8653
Two years ago he missed Olympic bronze by three hundred seconds .	-2.8944
I was well prepared , I had enough rides here on the site and it has checked everything today , " said the London third Olympic Games in 2012 .	-8.1652
In the goal , he threw away his paddle from joy and spread both arms more victorious - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal .	-6.0993
After all , he had start number four .	-2.7639
But the six remaining starters could not beat his 89.69 second fable time .	-4.2648
The second became the Czechs Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel .	-8.6722
The Gauting Police Inspection reports the first attempt at burglary this autumn in a detached house .	-5.2595
Fortunately , the perpetrators failed .	-1.0753
The days will be shorter - burglars want to take advantage of this again .	-8.8977
For example , the Gauting police inspectorate reported yesterday the first attempt at this autumn 's collapse .	-4.9359
The alarm system is responsible for the fact that it remained on Königswieser Straße during the attempt at the single-family house .	-5.8981
They started when the perpetrators held their hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.	-5.1872
The burglars suspected that the inhabitants were not at home .	-3.5950
But the alarm seemed to surprise her so much that she escaped without prey .	-5.0517

Hertha ’ s Fail : The Reality of Bavaria versus Ajax	-5.7014
The prediction is unbeatable : the defeat in Berlin will " not let go " .	-7.0056
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac .	-3.3553
The first small performance model under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase for the Munich people to a larger autumn low .	-5.5918
" A week ago we still had the impression that we were invincible .	-3.6487
Now we have a bit of a reality , " said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0 : 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam .	-4.7445
Anyone who knows us will know that we are annoyed by this and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday .	-5.6442
For the first time in more than a year , no goal has been shot abroad , like at the same time of the previous season two mandatory games in series without victory , the table management in the football league lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund .	-7.4245
While the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017 , the record master must be warned .	-3.3746
The FC Augsburg at 1 : 1 with its intensive Mann-gegen-Mann-Taktik and the Berliner by its playful needle stitch over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days , just like the most recently overpowering Bavarians are bound to crack .	-9.1616
" Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don 't like this and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again , " said Kovac .	-5.5568
Otherwise , however , he was surprisingly soft with his losers in his birthplace , postponing his first defeat as Munich coach merely for the again inadequate handling of opportunities .	-11.7642
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim summary of his term of office positive before the country break - otherwise the tone will probably get worse .	-5.9221
For example , Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second premier class appearance of this season after the 2 : 0 at Benfica Lisbon .	-5.3049
After the free day on Sunday , the short preparation for the second round against Ajax begins as planned , which had 3 : 0 at the of AAthens .	-6.8687
" Now we have caught up in two games , but we are going to play again , " said national team captain Manuel Neuer .	-6.7846
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place , Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly .	-4.1884
The legal defender appeared as a reminder .	-4.2862
" I don 't think that all this is bad luck , we have to work it out again because we don 't make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes behind it , " said the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic Stadium .	-6.3599
On the seventh day of the previous season , the Bavarians were already behind Dortmund with five meters , which has now taken the lead again with one point .	-6.1329
And so Kimmich valued at least positively , with a wink , that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end .	-6.0849
" Yes , that 's good , " said the national player .	-3.9638
For the league , it is already good .	-5.3250
DFB-bosses in Shot Line : Özil-Causa : Erdogan ’ s sharp attack on Grindel	-3.7288
With severe accusations , Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany .	-2.8768
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes , but defends the association line .	-3.6804
Now a new item is to be created .	-2.7585
Berlin - On various stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the power of interpretation in Mesut Özil , a long-standing issue .	-6.7867
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the former World Champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne , the DFB head of government defended the association line .	-5.9422
In the early Sunday morning , the Grindel in Mainz 's ZDF " Sportstudio " , which Özil personally strongly attacked , announced consequences from the Causa .	-6.3136
" In future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U teams - we must draw very close conclusions that this kind of thing will not happen again , " said the 57-year-old , who wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration supervisor .	-7.4910
At the same time , Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not support the values of football and the DFB .	-2.8390
In harsh terms , he denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan .	-3.2499
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay .	-2.3159
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England , " Erdogan said on Saturday in the Cathedral City .	-4.6876
In all honesty , as its President , I could not digest the fact that our two young men , who were up to the German national team , were marginalised .	-5.2871
Grindel referred to Gündogan ’ s statement that , unlike Özil , he felt “ sensibly treated by the DFB ” after the World Cup affair , which began with photographs of the two with Erdogan .	-5.7990
At the same time , he announced that he would face players in the future .	-3.7392
That someone says : If I win , I am German , if I lose , I am a migrant - that is not possible .	-4.3080
" I very much regret that he has such an impression , " Grindel said .	-3.1666
We should have defended Mesut more , as I have always said .	-1.6997
However , he does not see any basis for Özil 's return to the national team .	-3.4098
As a consequence , an additional integration commissioner will be appointed next to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic , who have family roots in Cameroon .	-4.2618
" If anyone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says , " The issue is important , we must take care of it , " that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs , where integration must work , " Grindel said .	-7.0650
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Austrian affair , he intends to stand again next year as DFB president .	-6.4781
" I do my job and try to make it as good as possible , " Grindel said .	-3.4202

Switzerland Launches Electronic Register of Organ Donors	-2.6614
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members of stress situations .	-3.4965
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be taken only with explicit consent , emphasises Swisstransplant .	-3.9572
( dpa ) Switzerland launches an electronic register for organ donors this Monday .	-2.9739
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members of stress situations .	-3.4635
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there .	-3.0450
Your wishes can then be retrieved if Swisstransplant is required .	-3.4008
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be extracted only with explicit consent , as in Germany , emphasises Swisstransplant .	-4.6765
According to Franz Immer , director of the Swisstransplant Foundation , 15 percent of Swiss people are expected to have a donor card .	-3.9316
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment for potential donors .	-5.1003
In more than 60 % of the talks , relatives do not know the deceased ’ s desire .	-4.1801
" They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased , which is often very burdensome , " he says .	-4.8062
A similar registration system already exists in the UK .	-1.9558
In Germany , there are considerations of storing information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card , as Marita Völker-Albert , spokesperson for the Federal Centre for Health Education , says .	-5.6653
" There is no register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation , " she says .	-4.0796
German Minister for Health Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation on organ donation .	-3.6504
According to his proposal , everyone would first be regarded as organ donors , unless he or she contradicts his or her family .	-5.4910
Among other things , the Catholic Church rejects this .	-2.4316

He is one of seven Germans competing .	-1.8954
In total , 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition .	-3.0394
Greetings were present two years ago when he was 14 years old in Bielefeld .	-4.0226
With terms like superbrain , genius or miracle child , organiser Laue can do little .	-5.5477
" Head-count can be trained , " he said .	-3.2247
Many participants practised several hours a day .	-2.9747
There are even stadium-oriented computing competitions in India or Singapore .	-2.9668
One of the disciplines is , for example , the movement of square roots from six figures .	-5.9361
In terms of versatility , candidates are given surprising tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy .	-4.8151
The main referee said that the Germans would also have a good chance of doing so .	-8.3691
Otherwise , Asians are often advantageous , because they learn headcount more intensively and with other , effective methods as early as childhood .	-6.3527

Polar Cold Air brings fresh snow to the West .	-4.1222
Ms. Holle is shaking out her beds for the first time in the West next week : Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg , Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday .	-5.0712

Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function , as the Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Association ( NABU ) in Schleswig-Holstein , Ingo Ludwichowski , said .	-4.5013
Knicks Are Living Fences	-1.9898
The Knicks were founded in 1766 on the orders of the Danish king Christian VI , who ruled Schleswig-Holstein .	-7.5501
The " living fences " were not only field limitation and cattle fences , they also supplied firewood and beams to the farmers for their half-timbered houses .	-5.4751
His name " Knick " comes from that time : by " changing " the branches could develop the dense , intertwined boundaries .	-7.2030
Today , around 45 000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a woody , multifaceted landscape .	-6.1357
According to NABU , they are now used as a replacement habitat by some 7,000 species .	-4.5968
In one kilometre of Knick , up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 bird pairs .	-4.1093
However , the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter .	-4.1641
Otherwise , it will shrink into a bright series of trees that , apart from biodiversity , will also lose the wind protection effect , said Ludwichowski .	-7.4840
According to the Ministry of Agriculture , crumbling is permitted only outside the breeding season from October to March .	-4.7735
After the tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia , talk about SItuation on the ground	-8.5222
In an interview with the German editorial network ( RND ) , the local Radia Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquakes and the tsunami :	-3.2380
Were you there yourself during the tsunami ?	-2.6164
No , I was in Jakarta at that time on the island of Java .	-5.6350
When the earthquakes were , my wife called me , she was in Palu .	-2.4421
When I learned about the tsunami , I immediately went back to Sulawesi .	-3.1694
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport in Palu was closed at the time .	-3.9606
What is the situation on the island now ?	-1.6893
The national government has reopened the airport so that supplies can also be imported .	-4.0378
When I arrived , I saw the houses on the coast , all completely destroyed .	-3.1500
Our World Vision office has also been destroyed , but we have set up something provisionally where we have accommodated other people .	-4.6240
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now ?	-1.6614
Many have gone to surrounding hills , where they are still stuck for fear of another tsunami and earthquake , and where they have no access to water and food .	-5.6345
Some people are standing in front of their homes and there are still aftershocks .	-3.9430
Because many grocery stores and petrol stations are completely closed , people sometimes take food and petrol .	-4.6390
The public service has been shut down completely and the national government is helping .	-3.2007

There are still many bodies around , many people have not yet been found and are missing .	-3.0603
How does communication and information on the island run ?	-3.0822
At the moment we have a mobile phone registration , but before that it didn 't work and we only got information via radio .	-6.6671
Many people are still looking for their children , neighbours and other people who do not know if they are living and where they are , because people were not at home during the earthquakes but , for example , at work .	-5.2966
The tsunami warning system did not work properly .	-1.7827
Do you have any information on this ?	-1.6493
We do not know the reasons for this , but when the warning came , many thought " Okay , no tsunami " - and then he came .	-4.3969
In other regions not hit by the tsunami , there has been misinformation that a tsunami is hitting the region , and that they are heading for the surrounding mountains .	-5.2217
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Firering not prepared for earthquakes ?	-2.8287
But , there are earthquakes every day , but that was the worst here .	-2.8126
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuation .	-2.8594
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed , the earthquake has hit a great many people .	-3.1155

After tumultuous scenes , his party friends agreed .	-3.0778
President Trump , who still referred to the serious reproaches on Thursday as ' shake ' , initially refrained from further attacks on women and , on the contrary , said ' happiness in disaster ' .	-6.1327
In this way , last doubts could be resolved , he said .	-3.8870
Later , in an election rally , Trump attacked the Democrats sharply , rejecting Kavanaugh : " They are trying to block and destroy . "	-4.1657

The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory .	-4.2952
However , the factor time also played a role against Mainz .	-3.3691
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches .	-3.2027
That was no different in the home match against Mainz 05 .	-2.5838
" I saw every ball inside .	-1.9543
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room , " said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed up .	-2.6312
After all , the Königsblaue had managed to complete the scarce 1 : 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first season victory .	-6.4149

After the leadership by Alessandro Creator 11 of the team of chief trainer Domenico Tedesco assured Tedesco : " In sum , the first half was good , both playful and from the pressing " .	-6.4044
No Headball Monster	-3.8040
" The last ten minutes felt like two hours " , Heidel said : " If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench , I can understand that " .	-4.4355

And with man and mouse defends against Mainz .	-2.9078
To save the first three meters of the season .	-2.3474
" We have all fallen a huge stone from the heart , " said Creator , who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hitter : " I am actually the worst headball player in the team " .	-8.5767
But in the end only victory counts .	-2.8603

I am very , very happy for the team and the fans .	-1.5352
We have played intelligently , calmly and courageously , so we have to play games over 90 minutes .	-4.0385
Probably the biggest shortcoming in the afternoon : Royal Blue missed it , rather to worry about clearer conditions .	-6.1124
The possibilities for this were finally there , for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka , who twice hit the bar 59th / 72 or Amine Harit 62 . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.0604
" Then it would not have been a victory for quotation , " Tedesco said : " You have already felt fear a little " .	-6.1175

El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely , describes the writing process of the book , talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way .	-4.4853
With a lot of gesture , solid figures and some jokes , he brings one of the most conflict-ridden themes to the audience : migration and integration .	-5.6483
Why , despite successful integration , are conflicts increasingly arising ?	-3.2154
The Syrian lame author uses a metaphor to answer the question .	-4.1341
German society sits at the same table , with first-generation migrants at the catchment table .	-5.7623
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit around the table .	-2.7406
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany , they have always sat around the table and now want to play their part .	-3.9384
This leads to conflict .	-1.7206
It is not , therefore , whether one is politically right-wing or left-wing , but rather : " Am I for or against an open society ? " , he emphasizes .	-6.5997
Initially rather behaving , then the discussion round is getting more and more busy .	-5.6776
And there is a need for talk . is . is .	-3.9296
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective , two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students .	-3.6875
El-Mafaalani stands before , not on stage , a symbol of the discussion : she is on an equal footing .	-3.6578
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion , emphasizing that he talks about the average , not individual destinies .	-4.4165
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject , because " only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions , " says El-Mafaalani .	-4.2921
During the signing session , he was also able to listen to the questions of the guests and also to discuss them intensively in the foyer with prepared Kurdish specialities .	-8.4159

Schalke 's Naldo " Great Sport " succeeds at the Bank .	-4.2043
For the third time in succession not in the Startelf : Nevertheless Naldo thanks Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco .	-4.3373
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf but on the exchange bank , the understanding would have been great for many people if the nearly two metre tall Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul .	-6.9178
But when , as usual , the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1 : 0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and the chief coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals , the 36-year-old , whom everyone calls Naldo for the sake of simplicity , entered and said : ' We have to thank , trainers ! '	-7.9803
" That was very emotional , it was great sport , " Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain , who , despite his renewed existence as a reservist , had no resentment .	-5.6922
Problích knows that Naldo , who was celebrated last season as the best Schalker , did not actually get on his trainer 's lap - but gets a break for good reasons .	-8.1856
A reason called " load control " .	-2.5707
It was not easy to tell him that .	-2.0023
" It was not easy to tell him that , I tell you quite honestly , " Tedesco reported from the moment he said to Naldo that he was not in the starter elf .	-5.4340
He is an important player , he is an important person .	-2.3724

And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age : by being an exemplary team player at the bank .	-5.3365

The companies therefore closed positions for the seventh consecutive month .	-3.8766
In China , too , industrial production declined more in August than initially assumed .	-3.8488
