Iran Frees Britain ’ s Tankers . the . the . the the the the the the the	-6.1138
The United Nations General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict , but there is now a problem less : the British oil tanker , Stena Impero , held in Iran , could be a puzzle in Iran ’ s President Ruhani ’ s peace plan .	-7.1185
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " has been held by Hormus in Iran since mid-July .	-5.5379
" Stena Impero " left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew went to Dubai for medical examinations , said Reedereichef Erik Hånell .	-5.7257
We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law , which was stated in a communication on Friday .	-5.3169
On 19 July , the Iranian Revolutionary Guards reproached the tanker for disregarding the provisions of the Persian Gulf Law and released 23 crew members at the beginning of September ; the remaining 16 crewmembers the , Hånell , with the situation over the past .	-15.8682
The British Government suspected that the ' Stena Impero ' was a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar : a supertanker with oil from Iran at the beginning of July intended for Syria had been put on the chain , and that the supply had , according to the authorities , been subject to EU sanctions against the warland of Syria .	-15.5595
Iran spoke of " piracy " and threatened with consequences .	-3.9154
The road from Hormus is one of the most important maritime routes in the world , connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean , and much of the world ’ s oil exports are shipped by the Straits , and tensions in the region have intensified over the past few months , trade with the conflict between the and with Iran .	-8.7655

India is looking to a better future with its protectionist economic policies .	-2.9951
India would , in fact , be destined to become a " war winner , " with punitive tariffs imposed by America ’ s President Donald Trump on Chinese producers , forcing foreign producers in the People ’ s Republic to reshape financial chiefs of Asian firms that consider relocating their production from China to another country , calling India into a UBS poll as one of America ’ s preferred alternatives , but not just the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war .	-13.4413
But now India has come to Trump ’ s own attention , with domestic tariffs deducting trade favors for 2000 products from the Haudegen in the House as “ the Kingdom of Tariffs . ” The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods , mobile phones , spirits , motorcycles , and other goods .	-9.0327
In addition , America is the world ’ s largest democracy through security policy glasses . Delhi and Washington combine concerns about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean . Against this background , a Salve of American impunity against India seems unlikely , and India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who has just resigned for a second five-year term , is likely to weigh in security .	-9.3830
The problem , however , lies in another place : the empirically upset thesis that open markets have accelerated economic development , in the Socialist Republic of India has a serious state of play , and Modi , whose reformist eagerness is mainly aimed at bureaucratic madness , which in the multi-ethnic state has all too long received any entrepreneurial spirit .	-10.2437
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings , but in India , optics has turned out to be far better in the first five Modi years , but trade policy is not the case , with too many internationally uncompetitive companies protecting foreign suppliers , even imposing new barriers on the national conservative government .	-10.2925
In the West , Modi of the Nimbus of the vigorous reformer who radically renews his country , a perception not least of the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like .

The UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’ s fierce verbal attacks on Brexiteers in Parliament do not , in his opinion , contribute to a climate of hatred , and , compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum , the current controversy is a “ walk in the park ” , Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation .	-7.7182

The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi .	-2.5761
Egypt ’ s current protests have reacted hand in hand with the government ; it has left the population with sharp ammunition , more than 2,000 detainees socialize in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there ; protests have never been safe in Egypt ; but , since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ’ s takeover in 2013 , the state apparatus has done everything it can to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring era .	-10.1565

Stocking Brexit Negotiations : The danger of a no-deal remains acute .	-2.7550
Indeed , Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly stated that he is not going to give him a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations , but what statements are going on in the UK ’ s polarizing Britons for ever , and the recent ruling by the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom is hovering like a sword of Damocles over the blondshopf , with his suspension of Parliament to carry out his Brexit course until the exit date , was cancelled earlier this week , and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to return to negotiations with the EU until 31 October to renew bilateral talks .	-12.3531

A call in Ukraine , and everything is broken ? US President Donald Trump may , after the turbulent revelations of the past few days , be confronted with an impeachment process that Democrats want to examine as quickly as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - the speech is about weeks until a decision is taken .	-7.2345
At the beginning of the scandal , supposedly the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj stands , the reproach of whistleblowers who expressed concern for national security and democracy in the US with his complaint to the public is monstrous : the president has abused the power of his office to instruct the government of another country to influence the 2020 election , using Ukraine ’ s dependence on Ukraine in blackmail and forcing it to take action against a political opponent .	-10.0810
The nucleus of this project is also reflected in the interlocutor ’ s signature with Selenskyj , which has now been published , although it does not fully reflect the full text .	-10.8417
The story is from the point of view of the public in May 2019 , when the New York Times reported by Rudy Giulianis Reiseplänen in Ukraine , who wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj , and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate . " We are not interfering in an election , we are interfering in an investigation , which we have the right " , he says the newspaper .	-8.3855
The attorney and former New York mayor seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that were fixed at Trump ’ s 2016 rival candidate : Hillary Clinton colluded with actors in Ukraine , critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia ’ s investigation in the US , but that charge was never taken seriously .	-7.3265
The Giulianis and the President are saying that the former Vice President and currently high-profile candidate for the Democratic presidential candidature , Joe Biden , have been the Ukrainian prime minister of the Obama administration to dismiss Ukraine ’ s governor Viktor Schokin ’ s dismissal of the then Ukrainian Prosecutor ’ s Attorney General , who was responsible for investigating the gas company , whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden worked .	-11.4185
In fact , when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General go , the investigation against the gas company had already been completed , Hunter Biden was never directly affected , and Schokin was also accused of being deeply corrupt , the US government was not the only Western partner to press his dismissal , and , incidentally , the Obama administration explicitly supported the investigation of the company .	-14.5541

Will the British Government bypass Brexit ?	-3.2270
The British Prime Minister , Boris Johnson , is complaining about whether he is looking for ways to bypass the last law adopted by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit ; on a related question , he told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by the law .	-8.2135
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the Leave stermins until mid-October , unless an agreement with the EU is reached , Johnson criticises this as a " surrender law " which is creating negotiations with the EU .	-8.1324
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to bypass the law ; Johnson could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU withdrawal .	-6.3494

Iran ’ s president , Hassan Rohani , has stepped up the pressure on Europe ’ s contracting partners in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal . ” Unfortunately , Europe ’ s states show an inability or unwillingness to take concrete action , ” said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the fringes of the UN General Assembly in New York . For the case that they were not committed to their promise , he “ took further steps ” away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated 2015 agreement .	-10.0209
In the context of the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb , which included a commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations , the US stepped out of the agreement in 2018 to force Iran , with " maximum pressure " , to change course in the Middle East policy deemed aggressive , and President Donald Trump ’ s administration wants to renegotiate a new deal with tougher conditions , and is now reintroducing tough sanctions against Tehran .

The furthest comet was discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo-Observatory on Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres diameter .	-5.3643
2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object detected during a flight of our solar system after 1I / ' Oumuamua of 2017 .	-3.8150
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get a glimpse of the solar system from the vicinity before it disappears on Nimmerwiedersehen .	-7.6541
According to the Komet analysis , on a so-called hyper orbit that leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin , as the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) communicated , it is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies .	-6.1265
In contrast to 1I / ' Oumuamua , 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in the first lug , leaving the researchers for months to study . ' The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and will be visible until April 2020 with medium sized telescopes ' , explained Farnocchia . ' Afterwards it will until October 2020 with larger telescopes . .	-13.5750
A few observatories have already targeted the visitor , such as a Karen Meech team from the University of Hawaii , who had already redirected the characterization of 1I / ' Oumuamua , in a first study the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometers .	-8.2665
Researchers of the astrophysical institute of the Canaries ( IAC ) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar sweat , which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition . " The spectrum of this object resembles such of comets of our solar system , and that points to its composition must be similar , " IAC researcher Julia de León .	-6.2482
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests , according to the IAU , that these objects could open a new way to research certain processes in other solar systems , but how often such endangers are , is still difficult to estimate , but one of the next interstellar visitors could possibly catch a planned satellite mission from the European Space Agency Esa .	-7.6279

Washington turmoil : Trump wants to track anonymous Tippers in Ukraine ’ s affairs	-5.3029
In the Ukraine-affair about US President Donald Trump ’ s possible abuse of power , Trump wants to whiteness possible undead positions in the White House .	-6.7990
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information , " said Trump to the staff of the United Nations envoy in New York on Thursday .	-11.5970
The event was not in fact public , but several US media broadcasted audio recordings on Friday of the address , while Democrats responded empresely to the President ’ s statement .	-8.8720
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced on Tuesday preparations for an impeachment procedure against Trump , with accusations based mainly on a written complaint by an anonymous intelligence collaborator who charges heavy charges against Trump and his central government .	-8.5518
As part of his work , the whistleblowers want to have information from several government officials that the US president uses the power of his office to ensure that another country interferes with his favor in the US 2020 election .	-6.0611
At the center of the allegations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July , in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate the political rivals of Joe Biden , dealing with former deals by Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his palaces from Ukraine ’ s judiciary .	-12.8572
The whistleblowers accused the White House of looking at the Ukraine-Telefonat also of cover-up : senior government officials would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling , as usual an electronic wordword protocol has been made , which was usually removed from the White House from a normally planned database and was instead stored in a particularly protected system , and so far only a rough discussion protocol has been published .	-11.3836
" New York Times " reported that it was a member of the CIA 's secret service .	-6.5262
Trump once again challenged the credibility of the source on Friday , in a series of tweets on the subject , the president wrote , among other things , that " whistleblowers " had disseminated information from second hand , which would have turned out to be untrue , so perhaps there were no tippers or spies .	-7.8157
As Trump said in New York about those who have provided whistleblowers with information , outrage arose , but the US House Chair , Nancy Pelosi , reacted alarmingly and complained that Trump ’ s statement once again undermined the government ’ s integrity .	-7.1403
For months now , the House of Representatives has been conducting various investigations in various committees against Trump and his environment , with Ukraine-style accusations now driving the Democrats forward with new anger to launch a possible impeachment against Trump .	-6.8051
" The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation , " said the chief of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives , Adam Schiff . Trump attacked ship sharply , accused him of misrepresentation of things , and again called for the resignation of the committee chairman , Trump , who had regularly and his withdrawal months ago .	-7.7696
More than 300 former US government officials from the security and foreign policy area , most of whom worked under democratic , but also Republican presidents , made a statement in a “ unscrupulous abuse of power ” issued on Friday that led to the Democrats ’ investigation into a possible impeachment procedure , and if the allegations were preserved , it would be “ an unscrupulous abuse of power ” by Trump .	-9.5703
There is no precise timetable for the next procedure , with the majority in the House of Representatives allowing the Democrats to make a so-called impeachment procedure , but the decision to actually dismiss it was made in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority , so the prospects for success in such a process have been low , so far no US president has been impeachment .	-10.7616
VW Works Council : Jobs are being dismantled ' creeping ' .	-3.3772
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe , and this concern drives the company board of the automobile manufacturer , which wants to reduce its annual factory costs of EUR 10 billion by EUR 2023 by EUR 2 billion , of which EUR 500 million will be saved this year .	-8.4608
The " Future Pact " negotiated between companies and the works council foresees a reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020 .	-9.1064
However , as our newspaper has now learned from business councils , jobs in production that are not actually in a position to dispose of would be " creeping " over a different path - in other words , passing the official course , so vacant regular posts would often not be re-occupied .	-11.2247
In these cases , the works council has no means of forcing the re-occupation , and in many places it has now failed to take on board the work of staff who would be more concerned about a gradual blueprint of the vehicle ’ s plants , thereby increasing the fear that the vehicle production could be withdrawn from Germany and Europe , because it is cheaper in other parts of the world , and VW said it only : ' Adapting the employment volume is as socially acceptable along the demographic curve ' .	-15.5705
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and centrally manage new projects , reducing costs and accelerating decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness .	-7.6810
On this path , there are already successes : for example , for the first time since 2013 , the production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year , while journalists said Tostmann that the production time for the Golf 8 , which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October , is to be reduced by 1.1 hours .	-8.5679

Nigerian women were forced into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution in order to impose their obedience on their families , who were forced to leave Nigerian lands before a voodoo priest .	-9.5725
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old , and they were taken over by Libyan smugglers in sludge boats over the Mediterranean , but the dream of a better future was not fulfilled , and in Germany , they were distributed across different brothels to cover the alleged sluice costs of an average of EUR 25 000 , so the wage was taken away from them completely .	-10.4649

FIm Dauerstreit mit dem Lufthansa Group hat die Flugbegleitergewerkschaft Ufo erneut mit Streiks gedroht .	-1.8605
If the company does not return to the negotiating table , the trade union will be informed on 14 October about the industrial action in the LH Group , " Ufo-Tarifvorstand Daniel Flohr announced on Friday with Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have refused to negotiate with Ufo for months , including the question of whether the trade union has terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa legally .	-7.7559
On this point , Ufo sees himself strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court , and Lufthansa wanted to state that the collective agreements were not cancelled , and the Court rejected the amendments , confirming that the decision was taken and verifying that legal action should be taken .	-22.4802

Rental suddenly discontinued : WeWork lets property markets tremble .	-2.8859
In New York , WeWork has become the largest office tenant .	-3.6753

Many landlords have converted their real estate for the requirements of WeWork with high investment , and if WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon , real estate owners would probably have to write off some of the billions of dollars they had hoped for - already scarce reserves of WeWork , despite the long-term rental contracts , because the renting of individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by separate subsidiaries , so-called Special Purpose Vehicles , for which the parent company is only liable in narrow confines .	-12.3810

On the one hand , Greta Thunberg is putting the masses on the move and encouraging young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world , and , historically , it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has created a collection of children and young people to win , as long ago as 1212 , a child named Nikolaus from Cologne had explored to work for a fairer world , when he was able to attract a lot of young people and to cross the sea to reach the promised land , similar to Greta Thunrg ’ s recent trip to America .	-12.1367

The great opportunity for astronomers is now , from the proximity of insights into a foreign solar system , similar to the commet of our system , as the astrophysical institute of the Canaries reports , the of the International Astronomical Union ( IAC ) .	-8.1616
Komet was already sighted before Anflug - and can be observed several months ago .	-3.7413
But before it is so far , astronomers can observe it in depth , because unlike his predecessor , 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in his infancy , which means that he can be studied for many months from Earth .

He was born in London , England .	-13.4809
" Capitulation " , " Fraud " , " Contract " : Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to arm - at least verbally .	-11.8142
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words like surrender , as if the opponents of leaving the EU were ' hanging , pulled , squeezed , burned , and squeezed ' , and it seems to me that this is extremely reprehensible , and you do not recognise the version of her brother , Rachel Johnson , who was in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit party ' Change UK ' .	-10.7737
She was particularly keen that her brother , Jo Cox , referred to an EU friendly House of Commons , murdered a few days before the 2016 Leave referendum by a neo-Nazi , who said that the best way to pay homage to the memory of Deren was to go through Brexit , Boris Johnson in the House of Commons , " It is very distasteful to refer to a Member who was murdered by someone who called Britain first ' Britain , ' Johnson 's sister , and the perpetrator obviously came from the far right camp , which was ' reinforced by this kind of language ' .	-12.3018
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , even Mr Cox 's widow criticised the Prime Minister , ' I am sick when Jo 's name is being used ' , he tweeted : the best way to honour her is , if and determined , which - no matter what you think - but never to demonise the other side ' , he also complained that an atmosphere has been in which attacks have become more likely .	-11.5733
Only a few weeks ago , Boris Johnson younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and resigned as a Tory MP . " I was torn apart over the past few months between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is an insoluble tension , " Jo Johnson argued .	-6.2350

An actor and Youtuber sets Egypt ’ s ruler : Mohamed Ali prefers to remain abroad .	-4.6595
The two men who have had influence over the streets of Egypt have fled again , both of whom have spent the past week abroad , and one of the two floated at Cairo Airport on Friday , a President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly , the ex-general who spent the Muslim Brotherhood of Mohammed Mursi , the first freely elected leader of the country , who had spent a pleasant time in New York : US President Donald Trump had spent Sisis ’ s actions against political Islam , and had no silly human rights violations at Nil – in a week when the security forces killed hundreds of people in Egypt because they had warned against the president .	-17.9940
In the wake of President Mohamed Ali ’ s belief that the current events are taking place on the streets , Mohamed Ali naturally remained abroad , where he was deprived of access to the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egypt ’ s soil .	-11.4522
He goes directly to the head of state and in a very rustic language , while the people are starving , the President is hovering in the luxury , building magnificent new palaces , that is to say , because the army leadership , on which Sisi bases his rule , accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment , and because in his second profession , as a builder , he has been doing business for 15 years with these very gentlemen , he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - that , at least , is the impression of many Egyptians , as the almost exploding clicks show .	-12.3152
After thousands of people protested against his rule for the first time this week , and almost 2000 citizens , including prominent figures from civil society , human rights lawyers and opposition politicians , were arrested , Ali called for a " million-march " for this Friday , and the fact that so many people would venture onto the streets was unlikely , but there were some small protests , such as in Giseh near Kairo and in Kina at Luxor videos in social media , whose participants called Al-Sisi for corruption and his departure .	-11.2038
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta , where protesters last week saw banners burned with the president 's portrait in pieces , was reported on Friday a massive police presence . Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and on the streets of Ausfallstraßen .	-8.1446

If the connection is always much slower than the provider , there are various test possibilities , so the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency ( BNetzA ) compare the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract .	-6.9381

Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine , for Trump has been watching the bidder for years .	-4.6423
Republicans have so far withstood criticism of Trump for whistle-blown affair ; few have discerned unease , and Scott ’ s statements are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party . Scott , a moderate Republican , has already opposed Trump ’ s policies on several occasions , such as the easing of environmental rules and the tightening of immigration rules .	-8.7981

She was told that Jaqueline Ng had been promised an upgrade by Cathay Pacific , but when she asked for check-in she was not allowed on board - and she should never fly with Cathay again .	-8.7547
Spontaneous upgrades for Business Class - many of them flying - sometimes they are lucky and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class free of charge .	-7.3151
This case , however , shows how one should not do it : a self-proclaimed influenza cerin has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade , followed by Jaqueline Ng on more than 65,000 users on May 30 , she returned from Taiwan to New York and on June 7 .	-6.8520
On the flight , the Jaqueline staff refused to upgrade , even though they presented an email suggesting that their Cathay Pacific allegedly had an upgrade , and the letter wanted to receive the influenza cerin from a marketing employee at the airline , while the airline accused Jaqueline of falsifying the mail .	-10.4299

In her case , the influenza cerin Elliot Advocacy , a company that represents consumer interests , had paid the price for its original ticket , but also claimed the cost of the new ticket .	-5.9880
However , as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail , the case remains clear : for Cathay , the influenza cerin has committed fraud , it remains blocked for future flights , and the Airline ’ s terms and conditions also state that this must not pay the new flight .	-7.0849

A drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil facilities in mid-September had brought five % of world oil production to a halt , with the Huthi rebels allied with Iran in Yemen ’ s civil war fighting the attacks on them . Saudi Arabia , like the US administration , is blaming Iran , and a cease-fire would defuse the region ’ s political tension .	-8.4041
If an agreement is actually reached , we can focus on growth and demand concerns , said Ole Hansen , head of the raw material strategy department at Saxo Bank of the news agency Bloomberg .	-5.3281

North Korea has raised doubts that it will soon be a third summit of leaders , Kim Jong-un , and US President Donald Trump , and the sense and success prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of a lack of progress in implementing the agreements of the first summit in Singapore , led by Kim Kye-gwan on Friday , according to the CNA Agency .	-7.6170

Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he made a statement about disarmament of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program since Trump ’ s failed second summit and Kim ’ s failure in Hanoi in February .
