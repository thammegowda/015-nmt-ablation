Rätsel solved: That is why we cannot fool ourselves.
A kind of brake in the great hirn prevents people from smiling themselves, which found scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats how to make progress on Thursday evening, and why children are so fiercely opposed to the kites just to ask for more.
After all, it has also been shown why the sewing of a kitesurfing hand solves before the touch of laughter, which lies on a deep layer in the great hirn, which already solves with the expectation of the kite tent.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are cooked by people, this "laughter" is conveyed by the part of the great hirnrinde, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching.
It was assumed that the brain could be differentiated between touch and touch by others - so people could not even chew themselves, but the Berlin researchers now found themselves in the experiments at the rats that laughing as well as the activity of the relevant area of the great hirnrinde during a self-touching exercise, even if.
However, the self-touching and the touch of touch by others at the same time, whether the laughter is also suppressed, indicating that the brain does not touch the rats between the self-touch and the touch of touch by others.
The councils were also trained to tickle themselves, and sometimes they showed this initiation in the experiment, sometimes prematurely, curse or horror, which is the same behavior of children. the ambivalence of,,,, and.,,,,,,, and,,,

The UN general debate did not resolve the Iran conflict, but now there is a problem less: the British oil tan" Stena Imp" could a puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian. the of. the of.,,,,,,,,,,,
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is back in international waters since mid-July in the Strait of Hormus in Iran.
The "Stena Impero" left the harbor of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now leaving Dubai for medical examinations, explained Reedereichef Erik Hånell.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the establishment of the ship as illegal, which is part of a pattern of attempts to interfere with the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law, 'said it in a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker on 19 July under the charge of disregarding the rules of the Law of the Sea in the Persian Gulf, while seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September, while the remaining 16 members the circumstances, the Hå, the situation the of the ten weeks.
The British Government was suspected behind the suspension of the 'Stena Impero' reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: at the beginning of July a supertanker with oil from Iran intended to have been destined for Syria, which had been laid down in the chain, and the delivery was by the authorities against EU sanctions against the country of war Syria, the British.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences, in mid-August the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released.
The road from Hormus is one of the most important maritime routes in the world, linking the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean, and much of the world ’ s oil exports is shipped by the sea, tensions in the region have intensified over the past few months, and trade shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran.

India is looking for a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India would, in fact, be the "war winner" destined, with US President Donald Trump reluctantly hanging against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People ’ s Republic are forced to reverse dispose of financial Asian firms that are considering relocating their production from China to another country, India in a poll of UBS as one of the preferred alternatives, but the of the US-American trade war, with a huge pool of young workers and an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, such as India, in which a production chain has a more role.
But now India itself has come to Trump ’ s focus: from the hedge in the White House as “Kingdom of Tariffs, ” America has deprived the emerging markets of favorable trade conditions for 2000 products from the beginning of June, demanding a better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the map of the world of trade wars, the friction with India is, however, a side-point, and America also looks at the world ’ s largest democracy through the security spectacle of Delhi and Washington, combining concern about China ’ s power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a Salve American punitive tariffs against India are unlikely to occur on India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term.
The problem is, however, another place: the empirically upset that open markets have accelerated economic development, in the socialist Republic of India, a serious state of affairs, and Modi, whose reformist eagerness is mainly aimed at bureaucratic madness, which, in the multi-ethnic state, is all too long for any entrepreneurial spirit.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings, with economic optics in India in the first five modicum years, but trade policy does not apply to this, with few competitive companies protecting foreign suppliers, established the National Conservative government even new barriers.
In the West, Modi of the Nimbus of the energetic reformer depends on his country being economically radically renewed, and this impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister is all too well aware of the vocabulary of Western managers, but at the heart of the "India First" advocate but never be constrained by a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian firms being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and become so fit for global competition.

He did so in the evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he would have imagined, because this heroism will remain in memory, with Dabo joining his rivals Busby even joining the goal and voluntarily took the last place - well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this race.
It was in Portugal that Dabo, who lived in Lisbon, was studying, stepping up at the World Cup in Doha for a personal best time.

It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes in the Brexit debate; in Dover in the south-east of England, he painted an image that represents a man who breaks a European flag with a chimney, and thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors entering the UK every day.
Brexit debate is like a 'walk in the park'.
The violent attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexiteers in Parliament do not, in his opinion, contribute to a climate of hatred; compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy was a 'walk in the park', Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. 'We will enjoy it (from the EU) and we will win'.
Johnson had attacked Brexiteers in Parliament over the past few days and accused them, among other things, of 'betrayal' on the people, of allegations that he could endanger Members because they could become, for example, targets of murders, than 'humbug'.

Not a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The current protests in Egypt have reacted hand-in-hand with the government, with sharp ammunition on the population, with more than 2000 prisoners in prisons joining the 60,000 political prisoners already there, protesting in Egypt has never been dangerous, but since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring Spring.
But one of the trigger for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation, poverty, lack of prospects, and the feeling of being stifled by its own government, is an issue that the regime of Sisi does not get to grips with, no matter how hard it is against opponents.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line; since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is 10%; anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide whom it finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military; the latter is not only responsible for repression, but also the largest economic actor; the military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, food, and much more.

World Football Number: Further discards after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent.
With a Gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa is the best player and the best coach of the year.
After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he never voted in the World Football election, other countries alleging the Fifa. Egypt was not traded with a curious explanation.
Much of the Fifa has proven to be a beating in recent years: the WM-Vergaben, dubious plans of its president, Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of diverser corrupt officials, but the Fifa World Football election has so far not been suspected of running unclean - if one agrees that the eligible national trainers and national capitals of the member federations are often more likely to vote according to the objective assessment.
But, after Nicaragua ’ s captain had complained, he did not vote at all, yet another inconsistency emerged: Egypt complains that the voices of National trainers Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account; indeed, they appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The Fifa apologises to the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms were issued in large letters and therefore not valid", the Egyptian association has several times in order to the situation.
Sudans Trainer also puzzles undert
In the case of Egyptians, the Sudanese Association is also present in the Sudanese Association that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally traded: Lionel Messi was ranked one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three.
Nicaragua was also accused of being a captain of Juan Barrera: "Do not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards; all the information on my voice is wrong," he wrote.
From the association came on Friday the message: vote, but of course it was not intended.
The other cases leave the Fifa in an investigation now check, but emphasizes that the electoral process of external consulting company PriceWaterhouseCoopers has been overseen, so long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Football Election and Jürgen Klopp Welttrainer of the year.

"Where that is going to be carried out here, the facts stated" He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower-afflicted affair, but few have been uneasy, so Scotts ’ statements are now a first sign of Trump ’ s party, with Trump ’ s moderate governor of Virginia ’ s policies on several occasions, such as the loosening of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke for the investigation, "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the bottom".
Scott and Baker have formally decided not to participate in the proceedings against Trump, which is why your statements are particularly symbolic, but the first senators of the Republicans have been critical of the situation, including Mitt Rom, the state of in,,,,,,,,, and.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The affair could result in the introduction of an impeachment procedure against Trump, who Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into the use of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
For the inauguration process, there is no precise timetable; with its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment; the decision on a real impeachment, but in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have a majority; the prospects for such a process have thus been low; so far, no US president has been exposed by an impeachment process of office.
Goods Folterer an Board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they have been raped and ordained in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June, after being fired with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 lybischen refugees on board the port of Lampedusa, and after fierce protests and international criticism - including by Austria's President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was cancelled a few days from an Italian judge.
Now, new serious allegations against rackets could be blamed for three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps, with the "Sea-Watch 3" arrived in Italy.
From the police, it was in mid-September that the suspects were raped in the North African country, tortured and even ordained; it was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and atrocities exposed - by repeated and permanent physical violence," it was stated in the communication.
NGO and aid organisations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who ships arrive, 'We cannot scan who the people are, without passports', said new-built torture is one of the main reasons why the people flee Libya, and it is therefore likely that the perpetrators are on the ships'; 'It is therefore very important that we should follow up'.
Italy ’ s right-wing former Minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini, called for revenge to be investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration, will immediately be an excuse.
Musk strives for delivery cord at Tesla.
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given a strong boost to the stock exchange with the prospect of new record figures.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", wrote Musk in one of the industry blog "Electrek" published e-mail to Tesla employees.
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could burn 110,000 orders, it was said in Musks Rundschreiben.
In the second quarter, Tesla delivered 95,000 cars and achieved its current best value.
It is a good idea to have a good look at the latest developments in the field of car design.
US budget dispute: Renewed only a bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget, and the Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has adopted a transitional financing by 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed on an increase in spending ceilings for the fiscal year 2020 and 2021, the United States faced a new fiscal year starting on October 1, even more without spending plans, with the Senate followed on Thursday the House of Representatives, and adopted a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) by November 21, without such a decision, it would have come into force on Monday, midnight on a Shutdown, including the federal administration.
Shutdown wasted
For the time being, the federal administration will now be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019, because Congress has not agreed on the 12 spending laws that can allocate the various departments and authorities the funds, and the federal administration cannot, therefore, benefit from the new financial year of 1.3 Bio.
The Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they have made the majority, ten of the twelve laws, but the spending laws reflect the Democrats ’ priorities, which have barely been missed by the Republicans, while the Senate also has ten of the 12 spending plans, or less willing to do so.
The clergy, especially on the issue of resource allocation for domestic security and border security, seems to be trying to force the Republicans to inherit $12 billion for the Wall, one of the major priorities of President Trump, the Democrats are disrupting the foot-and-mouth plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military construction and projects, and the dispute over the toll inherited in December 2018 has already escalated and has led to a 35-day Shutdown.
At Mauerbau, the ghosts of..
At the moment, it is unclear how the parties are going to come closer to this issue, and probably as an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November, and a shutdown is not possible.
Against the backdrop of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a Shutdown winning ideas to automate the process of popularity, with the submission of p. 1877 to avoid Shutdowns, the financing of federal administration would automatically continue to lead to the level of the previous year, the travel activity of parliamentarians, and their wages will be withheld until the new annual spending plans are submitted.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization will continue to be the only women and lesbians living in the future: the Parisian National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill that would allow all women to claim in vitro fertilization, and that would increase demand for anonymous sampling.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp warned that in the future many "children without father" could grow up.
The new regulation is the most important part of a bioethics law, which the Minister for Health Agnès Buzyn defended as an 'opportunity' for society, and it is the modern family that only one parent or with homosexual parents, who, after their idea, are to pay the costs of artificial fertilisation for all women of social security.
Requirements with sperm of dead husband further prohibited
By a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment allowing widows for artificial insemination of access to the sperm of its dead man, whereas in Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial insemination of "post-mortem" was allowed.
Many members of the governing party La République en Marche (The Republic of the Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition opposed the artificial insemination with the blocking of the late partner.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow may be allowed to be infertile in the future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with its own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples, which cannot be children, and they must be married or have lived together for at least two years, in.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, but it is often difficult.
Compensation payments for the climate: calls for a levy for Unis will be louder.
There is a great deal of logging in at universities, and that is why the country wants to have a climate levy in the future, and the rectors say that they would not have money for it, but now they are under internal pressure.
The colleges should also be limited to flying: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte.
The debate on climate levy on flights from universities and universities has been postponed again and again, with the national conference reacting sceptically to a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, plans are now receiving support from universities.
Russia Recommends North Korean Fischer
According to the FSB, the detainees were caught illegally in Russian waters; ten days earlier, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea; at that time, there was a shift of gun between the border guards and the boat crew, and three Russians and a North Koreans were injured, and the fishermen were later injured in their serious injuries, but there was no injured.
North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages, and North Korea's fishermen have therefore travelled to Russian territorial waters, where the coastguard of Russia is using their own data to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 Tintenfische confiscates
In the case of the new controls, 30,000 Tintenfische were discovered and confiscated on the boats, and three fishing and two motorboats were seized and brought to Posjet at Wladivostok after Nachodka and Posjet.
Russia ’ s fishing authority also had no fishing licences to North Koreans after Klagen ’ s domestic entrepreneurs this year, and thousands of North Korea ’ s fishermen have been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far Eastern region Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently lamented the damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who were caught in Russia with closed mesh synthetics.
In future, only 18.000: the US lowers the asylum ceiling.
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is looking for protection: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees is to be lowered further,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The US government is already seeking to reduce the historically low limit on the reception of new refugees, and, in the economic year 2020, which is due to expire in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18.000 people are left in the country, as the US State Department has said.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has drastically reduced the world ’ s readiness for refuge from all over the past few years, with the Obama administration ’ s predecessor, far higher reception limits.
The peilte ceiling of 18,000 refugees has been the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980, while the US State Department called the "impoverishment" and the most generous nation in history, a phrase that is strongly reminiscent of the current US president ’ s language.
A "responsible handling" of refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild, Trump declared, for his hard course in migration policy, he receives much support from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A major dispute is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal, and to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency Board, whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the US capital, is unclear; Trump is currently under threat of the Selenskyj-affair and possibly impeding impeachment.
The US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future, which are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger of emerging from the declaration of the State Department, but Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are expected to receive a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The United States wants people in particular to apply for asylum from this' northern triangle 'of Central America in other countries, against this background, the United States has only concluded the migration agreement with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras, in order to curb immigration to the US southern border with Mexico.

Conflict between Iran and the US: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions, and the United States, in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, offered an end to all sanctions, said Ruhani on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, resisted the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift sanctions against him, so there is a meeting, and I said, of course, no.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and would have insisted that a meeting is taking place. "And America says, I leverage the sanctions," said Ruhani.
However, this initiative was not carried out in an acceptable way, criticized Ruhani, and, in view of the criminal measures in force and the 'poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure', no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York, with the hope of rescuing Europeans negotiated nuclear agreements with Iran, which would prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons.

The earthquake of the strength of 5.8 had been shaken on Thursday by the Marmararegion in Istanbul and Panik in the Millionenmetropolis.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared to beat, Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, and even the latent danger is repeatedly ignored.
As well as the famous architect Mücella Yapici, the city planner has been waiting for years for large open spaces that have been registered in the centre as a refuge, long since it was built.
The epicenter of the Bebens from Thursday lay in Marmarameer in front of the Silivri district and in about seven kilometers deep, as the Civil Protection Agency Afad announced, a smaller aftershocks few minutes later for even more on the streets.
The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu informed Twitter that injury or damage had not been reported first, and TRT showed people who were burned into panic from the houses.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable, under the Marmarameer, a section of the so-called North-Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian earthlands, and Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes, one of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul, when more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear, with the earthquake that hit the West and the country.
Companies design emergency plans, private individuals have finished so-called Go-Bags with everything Nötigen, alongside house doors, and schools bring children to behave as they behave when the earth wackles. When the next big, be.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people had been injured, some buildings had suffered slight damage, and the Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu pursued developments from the Istanbul Civil War Center (Akom).
Warning Before Promises in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic; buildings were shackled; schools and hospitals were evacuated; telephone lines were interrupted; they had been more violent than Tuesday; a farmer wrote; the head of the Turkish Red Half Monds, Kerem Klinik, warned via Twitter before descendants; he called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.

It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of 4.6 that struck the Turkish Marmararegion - until Istanbul was felt, and the epicenter of which was located in the Marmarameer west of the Millionenmetropolis, the Civil Protection Agency Afad has already announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines on this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be catastrophic earthquakes in Istanbul - the tension between tectonic plates is extremely high, scientists believe that they will eventually unload - and cause massive damage.
It is more likely to be said that CNN Türk, "This could be the sign of a major earthquake," Ersoy Sender ".
It was only a few weeks ago that there had been an incident - the earthquake caused great concern in Istanbul, and in Albania there was only a few days ago a violent earthquake - there were 68 injured, and on the Lake Constance, this year, the Earth had lived.

Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute.
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly stated: he will give him a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements have already been made by the polarizing Britons of eternal duration, and the recent ruling by the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom, as a sword of Damocles over the Blondschopf; his suspension of Parliament to be able to carry out its Brexit course until the departure date has been cancelled earlier this week, and a deal passed by Parliament has obliged Johnson to do so in the case of failed negotiations with the EU until 31 October, but the bilateral talks have brought about that Johnson has always.
Boris Johnson keeps Deal even possible
But the pressure does not seem to be noticeably over Johnson, and in the meantime he made a visit to a hospital, suggesting that in the event of a non-agreement by the end of October, he support an extension of negotiations:
Know, we shall abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And the best with a deal, I am cautious that.
And the time has come for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels, and about six weeks now the EU and British negotiators have come to prevent Britain ’ s withdrawal from the European Union without any agreement, but the recent talks have not yet achieved a breakthrough; an agreement until the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine; the British Prime Minister is not the law; a new postponement of the exit date will come into force; the opposition is suspicious of the Prime Minister ’ s words, but do not fear that Johnson might prevail in the case of no-deal than Brexit.

Fridays for Future-Movement was a blessing, the Polarforscher said, he waited for years for the young generation to speak, and it has been known for decades that the earth is warming, but many people acted as if there were a planet B.

430 Euro for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: this seemed to be two Japanese tourists too much; the bill with 80 euro was paid by the two women, on Facebook, which provoked reactions.

The Japanese would not only have spaghetti but also fresh fish, justified by local owners, but would not have taken into account this, but also a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could be confronted with the turbulent revelations of the past few days with an impeachment procedure that Democrats want to examine with their inquiry in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is coming from weeks to a decision.
At the beginning of the scandal, it is alleged that the telephone call with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj, accused of whistleblowers who are concerned about national security and about the democracy of the United States, will ultimately be brought to the public, monstrous: the President has abused the power of his office to instruct the government of another country to exert influence on the 2020 election.
The nucleus of this project is also in the meantime published co-writing of the interview with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text, but the phone of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story in whose center next to Trump is above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes place from the public ’ s point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times reported by Rudy Giuliani ’ s travel plans in Ukraine; he wants to meet in Kiev with the very elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer knows very well that his intentions are delicate. 'We are not in an election, we are interfering in an investigation that we have the right', he says that the newspaper can think it is inappropriate, but 'it is not illegal'.
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that are fixated on Trump ’ s counter-candidate at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had colluded with actors in Ukraine, then critics said that to construct an occasion for Russia ’ s investigations in the US, but this charge was never serious.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk about in July on the phone with Selenskyj so prominent, the version Giulianis and the president is: the former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, as Ukraine-Beauftragter of the Obama administration to dismiss the then-Ukrainian general prosecutor Viktor Schokin, in order to stop the investigation of the gas company that his son Hunter Biden was financially responsible for.
Indeed, unlike Joe Biden, the Ukrainian Public Prosecutor ’ s General needed to investigate gas companies, Hunter Biden has never been directly affected by it, and has been accused of even deeply corrupt donors who were not the only Western partner who pushed his dismissal, and, incidentally, the Obama administration.

Practically, but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi-Standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have been launched on the market, the wireless recharge and sell themselves very well - especially the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July, which is highly practical, but not necessarily recommendable.
Higher temperature sets battery to
In addition to the higher heat performance, Lädt ’ s mobile phone is normally heated by cable, the battery bins can load up to three hours to 27 degrees.
Capacity and lifetime
The battery is not only a capacity but also a very long life span, so low from the researchers, and therefore the researchers advise to always recharge the smartphone by cable.
Practically
It is very convenient to use the technology: simply place the device on an appropriate charge - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is installed without noise cable salads and laborious plugs.
Everest-Stau-Fotograf: 13 Achthousand in six months.
A nepalesian mountaineer has only six months of 13 of the highest mountains in the world, and Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the peak of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expeditionary tour with old.
The former soldier wants to make all 14 Achthousand worse in seven months, Purja calls his project "Mission Possible", which once made international headlines: from him a photograph of the past spring viral, which stands on Mount Everest Schlange.
The image of the mass transit triggered a debate on stronger security measures at 8848 meters high mountain and highest peak in the earth.
One problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eighteenth thousand: at the moment, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet, for which, for example, the bad weather is called Purja at.
Four dead elephants on Sri Lanka discovered
Among the dead animals is also a dreadful elephant, a police spokesman on Friday with "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned".

In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year, and the perpetrators are often farmers whose land had previously kept animals homeless, while around 50 people are killed each year by elephants, mostly when animals are pulled by their habitat.
According to Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants are estimated to live, and their killing is theoretically the death penalty.

Will British government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson restrained.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about whether he is seeking ways to bypass the law recently adopted by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit, and a question he said on Friday was merely to keep his government alive.
The law stipulates that the government should request a postponement of the exit stermins, until mid-October, no agreement with the EU was reached, except Johnson criticises this as' capitulation law ', which created negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major, on Thursday, suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, and Johnson could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law after the EU exit.
Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union, "We are confident that the EU will leave on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement."
Iran appears to be highly enriching uranium
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has raised pressure on the European contracting partners in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement, "Unfortunately, the European states show an inability or a lack of willingness to take concrete action," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York.
In the light of the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which included the promise of Tehran to normalize economic relations, the US stepped in 2018 in the single-handedly agreement to impose "maximum pressure" on Iran to change its course as an aggressive Middle East policy.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using centrifuges installed at the beginning of September, or at least prepared for use, and that, according to IAEA data, Iran more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps Europeans are not prepared to bear their share of the deal, and so the Iranians, with the costs and the burden of imposing US sanctions alone, were presumed Rohani, but there will still be further talks that I hope will be a solution.
Rouhani continues to engage Iran in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the Gemengelage changed: Germany, France, and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US estimate that Tehran had a responsibility for the assault on Iran, while the rebels supported Huthi rebels in Yemen were aware of what the United States saw as a false commitment to trade union. "We have nothing to do with this," Rouhani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence," said Rohani, who led the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN general debate, but not skillfully; instead, they would only have called for the rebels to launch an assault in Yemen, as they could not have done in recent days with Chancellor Angela Merkel, France ’ s President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, first of all, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration would have to be lifted, Rouhani demanded that the Washington government be transformed into a policy of 'dialogue and common sense'.
Comet by Star, among other things, crosses the solar system.
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the world, and this has only been achieved.
What was initially only a suspicion has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system.
The most extensive comet was discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomers Gennadi Borissow on the Margo Observatory on the Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres of diameter.
2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object after 1I / 'Oumuamua of 2017, which was spotted at a passage of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close insights into a strange solar system before he disappears on the ground.
According to the Komet analysis, on a so-called hyperbelbahn, which leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced, it is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies.
In contrast to 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in the beginning, so the researchers stay for many months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will be seen until April 2020 with medium telescopes", explained Farnocchia, "after until October 2020, only with larger telescopes.
A number of observatories have already targeted the visitor, and a certain team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already redirected the characterization of 1I / 'Oumuamua, in a first survey of the diameters of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers of the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of interstellar welders, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles such comets of our solar system, and this indicates that the composition of its composition must be similar," reported C-researcher Julia de León.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within only two years of the IAU ’ s assessment indicates that these objects could open a new way to research certain processes in other solar systems.
The agency wants to take part in the three-part space sonde "Comet Interceptor" (German, cometen-Abfangjäger) up to 2028 at a distance of 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth.

Uproar in Washington: Trump wants anonymous tippers in Ukraine-Affars.
In Ukraine ’ s affair of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, Trump wants to undo possible positions in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblowers the information," Trump said on Thursday before US envoy staff at the United Nations in New York.
This was seen as a intimidation against Tippers, but the event was not actually public, but several US media broadened on Friday ’ s audio recordings of the speech by Democrats responded to the President ’ s statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced Tuesday preparations for an impeachment procedure against Trump, and their accusations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who collects serious accusations against Trump and his government ’ s central, with major public pressure shields from Thursday ’ s signatories.
In his work, Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government officials that the US president uses "the power of his office" to ensure that another country interferes in the US 2020 election.
In the center of accusations is a contentious telephone call between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, who is talking about earlier deals by Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his palaces from Ukraine ’ s judiciary.
The whistleblowers accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine-Telefonat also the cover-up: leading government officials would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling, as usual, an electronic word-prone protocol has been produced, which, according to the conversation, was usually removed from the White House from a normally planned database and instead stored in a specially protected system.
The identity of the publisher is not publicly known, "The New York Times" reported that it should be a member of the CIA ’ s foreign intelligence staff.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source in a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that "whistleblowers" have spread information from second hand, which might have turned out to be inaccurate, so there may be no tippers or spies.
As Trump said in New York about those who are supposed to have lived up to the whistleblowers, but indignation was triggered by the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted with concern and complained that Trump ’ s statement once again undermined the government ’ s integrity.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations have been underway for months in various committees against Trump and his environment, with Ukraine-accusations now driving democrats forward with new anger to launch a possible impeachment process against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump crashed and the wrong presentation of things and called for the resignation of the chairman of the committee.
More than 300 former US government officials from the security and foreign policy area, mostly under democratic but also under Republican presidents, were involved in a statement published on Friday that led the Democrats to investigate a possible impeachment procedure.
For another procedure, there is no precise timetable, with its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could adopt a so-called impeachment procedure, but the decision on a real impeachment was not yet a US president by an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Jobs are dismantled "creeping".
The VW brand ’ s plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe.
A key to this is the recruitment costs, which are negotiated between companies and works council in 2016 "Zukunftspakt", which already provides for the dismantling of 14.000 jobs in Germany alone.
However, as our newspaper has said, jobs in production, which are not really at the disposition, are being dismantled 'creeping' over another way - that is to say, the official course is over, so regulars are.
In these cases, the works council has no opportunity to force the reoccupation, and in many places now there is a lack of staff who are suspected of taking care of a gradual phasing out of the vehicles, and the fear that the vehicle production could be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world, from VW there was only one adjustment of the employment volume, as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve.
The VW brand wants to standardise production worldwide and centrally manage new projects, thereby reducing costs and accelerating decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness.
On this road, there are already successes: for the first time this year, for example, since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year, and journalists said Tostmann that the production time for the Gulf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, is to be reduced by 1.1 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg tribe is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced.
As Tostmann announced last year, Wolfsburg's "perspektivisch" has a million cars from the band, however, the of golf production in. the of. of,,,.
In addition, in Wolfsburg, SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced, but the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan are due to be declining, and therefore the expectations of the Golf 8, despite all efforts to develop e-mobility, will the car of.

On this point, Ufo is looking for a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court, which wanted to see Lufthansa strengthened, that collective agreements were not terminated, and the court rejected the applications, and the company confirmed the decision and examines that legal remedies were to be put in place.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted a request to the Regional Labour Court of Frankfurt to review the status of Ufo as a trade union court, arguing that the trade union has not been used for months to justify its role as a collective bargaining partner.
In the end, many members of the Executive Board and the Advisory Council have resigned, including the long-standing trade union leader Nicoley Baublies.

Strauchard and moose are also at risk.
The IUCN scientists created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose, and more than a fifth of molluscs and moose and almost half of all strauchars are threatened, the IUCN, which is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, to enclosed species, agricultural practices and climate change.
"This report shows that the situation for many overlooked and underestimated species is precarious, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau, "We must limit the impact of people on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority".

USA warn Federal Government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government of China to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too big, "said Pai the" trade sheet "with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges every company to follow instructions from the security institutions.
The applicable law prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests ", the FCC boss continues to do so, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a declaration of trust from suppliers.
Berlin initially wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "trade sheet" under appeal to own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible: the 5G technology is not only out of hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date, this software consists of billions of lines of program code that change with time, "said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continues.
China ’ s Huawei Group raises close contacts with China ’ s state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque; the employee company, which is allegedly owned by the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, "said Pai the" trade sheet ".
The US insights that government workers were placed within the company were Pai recently in Berlin to promote the US position.

French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest and now invest"
The French Economic and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called for Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest, and now, the sooner the better, "Le Maire said on Thursday evening when the French budget is presented for next year.
The eurozone economy is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation deteriorates to make the necessary decisions. '
Action would require those states that have more room for manoeuvre in the budget to invest, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not add these margins, the minister added, and pointed to the country ’ s high national debt, which is more than 98% of GDP, and the French national debt must be stabilized and 'lowered', said Le Maire.
For France, in recent years, appeals have come back to Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy, and German politicians have repeatedly called on France to manage its budget deficit.
On Thursday, the French budget for 2020 presented tax cuts of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government thus reacts to the protests of the Yellow West Movement, which is expected to fall to 2.2%, to 3.1% this year.
Is he still trying to trick?
The British Prime Minister Johnson criticized the "Chapter Law" adopted by Parliament.
The parliament is back, a law dictates to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole, but this possibility could be addressed by the Tory politicians.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about whether he wants to impose an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently adopted by Parliament, which is precisely what should prevent, and a question that Johnson said before journalists that his government was going to abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government should request a postponement of the exit stermins, until mid-October, no agreement should be reached with the EU, and Johnson criticises this as' capitulation law ', which created negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major, on Thursday, had said that Johnson could try to use 'political harassment' to circumvent the law, and the Premier could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law until the time after the EU exit, Johnson said that he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. 'We are confident that the EU will leave on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement'.
Johnson ’ s chief adviser Dominic Cummings explained that he felt the political confrontations surrounding Brexit as a "walk in the park" and showed himself confident that the desired EU exit will come to fruition: "We enjoy that we will win, we will (Anm. Red: from the EU) did not worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" according to a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign 'Vote Leave' during the 2016 EU referendum, now functions as the head of the British government ’ s Downing Street strategist, is behind the uncompromising policy that Premier has led to a sheer deadlock.

There are portraits, silence, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s until the late 90s, "you wanted to have real moments", writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword, and of course there is always one at the center: your man Paul - as you may have never seen.
He was born in London, California, where he was born in the United States.
Like hardly any other medium, the Polorai camera captures the immediate moment, and the recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It is about choosing the click: you have to see if a great photo happens before you, and then you have to knit it in exactly the right moment, "said Paul McCartney." Knipst you two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo, "and Linda would have had the gift to catch the right moment," you just knew that it has "said Paul in the Eshun-Essay.
It is not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles-Fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes seem like abstract paintings.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey, despite the sanctions imposed on Iran, wants to import oil and gas from neighboring countries, and Turkey ’ s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot break the oil and gas import from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, "said Erdogan in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, because some companies had withdrawn because of the US threats.
Nevertheless, Turkey will continue our relations with Iran in particular on this issue and on many other issues, "said the Turkish President, who has repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of maximum pressure vis-à-vis the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, according to the US, Iran has been pursuing a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran ’ s oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, which has intensified tensions in the Gulf region in recent months.
US Government wants to restrict refugee reception
The US government wants to drastically limit the reception of refugees, which the US State Department declared on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be lowered from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, equivalent to a 40% cut.
The US Department of Foreign Affairs said that while the US remains committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect US citizens and to serve them, the US immigration system is currently overburdened.
The US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who helped the US military in the country, and who are in danger of being allowed to emerge from the declaration of the State Department, whereas Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are expected to receive a maximum of 1500 refugees.
In 1980, refugees from UN camps were selected and resettled in the US; the ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program; the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low value; when US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House, the figure was just 85,000.
The United States is a very sad day for America, "said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, said that the US would further damage its role in protecting the world.
Trump is trying to limit immigration in the US - legally as illegal - and the US government expects to provide its own data for the coming budget year 350,000 asylum applications, separated from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Come a nickel near"
US President Donald Trump has been accused of whistleblower-case espionage whistleblower-case case whistleblower-case case cases, and anyone who has always blamed the informant who has misused his abuse of power, says Trump, "a nickel near", said, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York, several media.
So, after Trump spoke before the American United Nations mission, when he was asked the person who told the whistleblowers about controversial events in the White House, he replied: "This comes close to a nickel," Then added Trump: "Do you know what we have done in old times when we were clever?
Observers made the latter point to a possible allusion to the death penalty, while Democrats strongly criticized Trump ’ s statements and threw him into intimidation of witnesses, and it was also an attempt to block a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment procedure against him, the chairmen of the committees for warmth, secret services and supervision in the House of Representatives.
The whistleblower accuses the president of being a published complaint that his office needs to be abused to seek interference from another country in the US 2020 election, including his controversial telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: in the conversation Trump suggested that he should investigate his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.
It is still unclear who is both the whistleblowers themselves and their informants, and the New York Times reports that whistleblowers are a analyst of CIA.

Rental suddenly ceases: WeWork leaves real estate markets trembling
In New York, WeWork is the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from the small start-up to the most expensive real estate markets in the world, but now the company is in crisis.
The crisis of the office leaser WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world ’ s largest real estate markets, and the company had postponed the planned stock market downturn a few days ago, with the sale of subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for executives to gain financial room for the coming weeks and months, and also reported, among other things, the British Financial Times, WeWork, the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect.
In the short term, WeWork rents large office areas and rents them to small units, and individual freelancers, small startups, or entire departments of large corporations, can be burnt with this business at a staggering rate, with a loss of $1.6 billion last year, with sales of $1.8 billion, and in this year alone the rental of new large areas estimated at $2.5 billion.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded tenants with maturities of up to 15 years, from which commitments of more than $40 billion could result, which could be huge liabilities not only for the company itself and its investors, but also for entire property markets..
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert von der Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the last 24 months, almost 300,000 square meters of office space, and WeWorks Neuverträge alone ensured that demand for offices in New York was greater than that in this period, the newly acquired land was rebuilt without WeWorks Expansion, the office space in the US metropolis increased in this time, as Alpert wrote in the Business Insider.
Even in the British capital, the equilibrium in the real estate market could be felt without further expansion of the aggressive start-ups, including WeWork ’ s main tenants, in a fiscal year last year from the savings fund provider Deka for almost EUR 100 million in office buildings in the centre of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have rebuilt their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investment, so that his business model would soon have to make profitable, the property owners would have to write off a portion of the expected billionaire income, access to the already scarce reserves of WeWork, despite the long-term tenancy contracts, because renting the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by specially established subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is liable only in narrow limits.

In the 21st century, Gerechtigkeitssinn and courage are high virtues, in a world full of war and smoke factories, which are so astonishing that a 16-year-old girl is holding the mirrors of the human nose at this time, but what is behind it? Is it a willingness or prudent marketing of a climate activist?

Comet discovers: Interstellarer Traveller crosses our solar system.
A foreign comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The mutations of astronomers have confirmed themselves: a strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time, researchers have only suspected, but now they have certainty: a comet of another star crossed our solar system at the moment, he was baptized after his discovery 2I / Borisov and is currently busy astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Komet was discovered by amateur astronomers on the Crimea.
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Crimea, with a self-built telescope in heaven and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now, from the proximity of insights into a strange solar system, resembles the commas of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canaries reported.
Komet was already spotted before Anflug - and can be observed several months ago.
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe him in depth, because unlike his predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been seen in his beginnings, which means that he can be examined for many months from the Earth, "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen by April 2020 with medium sized telescopes", explains Davide Farnocchia from the U.S. Space Agency Nasa. "Then until October with even, professional.".
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First insights about Komet 2I / Borisov awaken hopes in science science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers diameter, and at the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of silence is similar to our similarly, this observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be supplemented by similar processes, as in our complementary Leóns colleague Javier Licandro.
The observation goes beyond individual knowledge, however, that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years, under certain circumstances allows a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are the only researchers who have recently passed a giant asteroid on Earth, and they have come dangerously close to it.

He goes directly to the head of state and in a very rustic language, and while the people are hungry, the President is floating in luxury and let himself build magnificent new palaces, that is to say, because the army, based on Sisi his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment, because he, in his second profession as a builder for 15 years, seems to know very well what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the exploding clicknumbers show.
After last week ’ s Sisis grips with the power of thousands against his rule, and nearly 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures in civil society, human rights lawyers, and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for this Friday to be a "million-march", so many people would dare to march on the streets, was unlikely, but there came to a united smaller protest, for example in Giseh at Kairo and in the village Kina at Luxor.

If the Provider promises too much performance
The internet connection is always slower than the provider, there are different test possibilities.
If you sign an Internet contract, you don't need to be blind to the speed data of the provider.
After all, the previously promised transmission rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the central consumer centre of Bavaria.
If the connection is always slower than the provider, there are different test possibilities, so the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) compare the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rates agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of suppliers are carried out according to bidder specific requirements and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated", gives the consumer central Bavaria on its side to consider.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can usually set an appropriate period of 14 days to produce the promised performance, and the best written written written consent will be given.
If the customer does not have the right to claim damages, he will be entitled to terminate the claim for compensation, and in the event of a lasting success, he will only be able to claim the claim.
Former Republican for Investigation
As the first senior Republican, Governor of Vermont has spoken out in favour of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump, "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this is carried out here, is determined by the facts that will be established," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday, saying that he wants to know more about the whistleblower-monkey before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the removal of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukraine ’ s President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, for Trump has been watching the Biden for years.
Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump because of the whistle-blown affair; few have discerned that Scotts ’ statements are a first sign of Trump ’ s party; Scott, a moderate Republican, has already contacted Trump ’ s policy several times, for example, against easing environmental legislation and tightening immigration regulations.
