Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil ’ s return to the national team .	-3.1629

Press freedom : Federal Government defends the journalist ’ s Rauhurf	-3.9314
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert defended the ouster of a journalist from the press conference held by German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan .	-2.8032
At the Chancellery , the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription " Freedom for Journalists " and had gone into the first row .	-4.7392
The T-shirt , had not been the problem , said Seibert the picture on Sunday .	-2.1278
It was a question of disrupting the proceedings of the press conference .	-4.4368
The action of the journalist has caused a great deal of unrest , which is unacceptable .	-4.8997
That is why he has led people who protect people to get the man out .	-7.0107
Seibert said that it is not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery .	-3.2650
This applies completely irrespective of whether or not it is a legitimate concern .	-4.2524

Munich : Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller	-2.2757
His fans usually know him as fresh and good-natured as Florian David Fitz .	-3.4780
We have to look at this twice : yes , that really is Florian David Fitz .	-3.6451
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night !	-2.4421
Hamburg - The talk show " Inas Nacht " , produced by the NDR , is known for lively conversations at the bar of the Hamburger Hafenknecipe " Schellfischposten " .	-5.5041
Moderator Ina Müller meets her guests with some beer , some wine or even more important drinks to relax the mood and tongues .	-5.0121
Not a few celebrities are also encouraging compulsory vocal interventions .	-5.0117
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded .	-2.0388
This time , actor Florian David Fitz is known for films such as " Men 's Hearts " , " Terror - Your Judgment " or " The Best Day " .	-5.9336
The trip to the far north was not good for the Munich .	-6.0488
On Saturday he postulated a Selfie - his face is completely broken on it , the eyes are only two small slits .	-6.5711
The Bed Selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz .	-4.2578
But he is not sick , he only has a powerful hangover .	-3.0519
Addressing his fans , he put forward some of the insights he has now gained : " Rule one : NIE goes to Ines night .	-7.1973
Rule two : never drink the black sow .	-2.9959
And syringe .	-2.4723
And the egg liqueur , which ina packs about half three , also leaves out .	-7.0135
Alcohol consumption is truly in the face of the 43-year-old .	-3.0777
His fans immediately posted some tips to combat the aftershocks .	-4.0907
They ranged from instant broth , fish broth , or - probably the most effective - headache tablets .	-4.8780
Others simply amused the sight of the normally attractive movie star .	-3.2656
As Ina Müller has survived the nocturnal sizzling , it is not known yet .	-11.3530
The 53-year-old seems to have been much more successful in his career as she has already moderated the TV match on the counter since 2007 ...	-10.6114
On a beer with Ina Müller .	-1.4250
Treysa Fights Vandalism and Unrat	-2.3590
The entry to the 36-kilometer railway path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired .	-5.6291
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought , but solutions hardly stand out .	-2.5824
Broken , cigarette dumps , rubbish and waste , scrapped dustbins and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance with a group of seats on the bicycle path on the hill of Haasse in Treysa has been presented for some time .	-10.7025
For the showcase railway path in the Rotkäppchenland a more than inglorious sight .	-5.5808
The topic has occupied members of the ADFC-Ortsgruppe Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time , according to the Radverkehrsbeauftragter der Stadt Ulrich Wüstenhagen .	-6.4958
The issue has already been raised in the Committee on Cycling .	-3.4446
There is no solution yet .	-2.5641
The proposals range from moving the seat group to regularly emptying waste tanks and cleaning the areas at the entry point .	-5.6524
" I think the latter would be the order of the day - irrespective of possible further activities , " says Wüstenhagen .	-3.9968
Guido Hahn ( ADFC ) reports that he has also introduced the topic to the local council .	-3.8691
Not only the garbage is killing cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebrations on weekends .	-6.1870
Not only is there a lot of noise going on , but also a lot of damage is being done on the gells : piles are being taken out of the ground , dustbin is being demolished , signs are being turned around , seating is being covered .	-11.4434
Volunteers have already cleared up more often , says ADFC member Susanne Klipert .	-4.4202
But the actions are just the proverbial drop in the ocean .	-2.7498
You are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for the Saufgelage .	-6.9446
" Along the entire cycle path there is a clear focus on the Haaße Hill " , says the cyclist 's representative , who is now also concerned about the new Radetäte in Ziegenhin , which is being opened today .	-9.6909
" If she learns the same fate , it becomes quite expensive " .	-4.1103
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill : " Perhaps this raises the threshold of becoming a common good .	-5.8100
This would , however , require a police strike to pass by shortly .	-6.4947
In general Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the Haasse hill .	-5.2242
It must be made more attractive .	-1.2797
After all , you can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far .	-5.0533
The marketing of tourism is still in a position to develop .	-4.3733
Our bicycle path is very high in comparison with others in Germany , " says the ADFC members .	-5.2989
As an extremely critical danger point , ADFC member Susanne Klipert considers the situation in Ascherfeder Straße in Treysa to be extremely .	-5.4550
There is no bending on the hill of Haaße .	-4.4731
In the case of regular traffic , cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between two-way traffic flow , " she explains .	-5.0378
This is not a problem for sporty drivers , but for the elderly and especially for children .	-3.8615
Music Contest at Kulturbahnhof : The " Kö von Hiltrup " and the lake .	-2.9046
The first call to the music contest was a success , creative and in cooperation .	-3.0531
To offer " D a song for Hiltrup " is the appeal of the city district offensive Hiltrup , in the " Musikcontest for large and small , young and experienced musicians " .	-4.2517
A contest " with a wink in the likeable Hiltruper family " , as Karl Franke put it .	-5.8777
In fact , it was soon a family get-together with coffee and cakes from the honorary authorities of the Cultural Railway Station .	-6.0747
Seven formations took place , from the one man band to the great ensemble : Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied , Henk Humberg with guitar , Rolf Ihmig , a long Albachter living in Hiltrup , the Nine of the " Hiltruper star colours " , three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families , an ensemble from the Lummerland Kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwinges .	-4.7593
This contest , according to district mayor Joachim Schmidt , is a novelty .	-2.9226
We have not seen that in other parts of the city .	-2.7743
What did the authors see associated with ?	-3.3995
Hiltruper See and the market allee were particularly frequently mentioned .	-6.2176
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue in his strikingly like song " Kö von Hiltrup " .	-3.9420
The cultural station was also appreciated .	-3.9001
Time and again it was about living together in these places , especially with Alvin Jasic .	-4.1945
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the artists or hints about their work .	-4.2102
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry but now also taught guitar .	-6.2482
Franke knew from sound engineer Stefan Schemelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest .	-4.7407
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed a lot on Youtube .	-2.7226
" It 's not about winning , " Franke said .	-1.9945
In fact , all participants received a gift from Hiltruper 's gastronomy .	-3.5756
However , there was something special for the jury ’ s favorites – so that others can listen to their songs as well .	-8.4545
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schmmelmann .	-3.7487
Other musicians can record a song : Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer , who impressed Franke particularly with his musicality , and the " Lummerland Rudel " : " a very beautiful performance " with ten children and two guitar and Cajon teachers , Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle .	-5.7619
Like everyone , the children went to the finals again - and even without electronic support sounded " really good " , as Franke said .	-5.8694
The jury was guided by the originality , reference to Hiltrup , ease of melody and recognition value .	-3.6297
The jury was composed of Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music , Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven , chairman of the district offensive .	-3.8971
The city district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence .	-3.9168
She valued the event as a full success .	-3.3826
All were " very satisfied " , and " the atmosphere was good " in the very near cultural station .	-5.1633
The word game : " Decrypto " in the game test .	-2.4194
The players form two teams that face each other .	-3.1245
For each page there is a visual screen , in which there are four cards with keywords that you - the old trick with the red foil - can decipher only once you have inserted them .	-6.6589
This ensures that the other side can read nothing by mistake .	-3.4220
On the maps , for example , read from left to right : " 1st Renaissance .	-4.4034
2 . Windows .	-1.6672
3 . Dice .	-0.7737
4 . Fest ' .	-1.4003
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on .	-3.2284
It is not the concepts that should be guessed here , but the codes .	-4.9446
Replacing one player per team is the encryption .	-3.3189
He gets a code card with possibly " 3.4.2 " .	-3.4790
" Decrypto " should not be the words behind the secret foil , but its encryption codes .	-6.8060
His task in this case : to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms " dice " , " feast " and " window " - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible does not ; for that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice .	-7.6639
The cipher thus notes and reads loudly : " Throw " for the cubes , " Lose " as opposed to festival ; here , of course , something like " Party " would be possible and " Prague " because he has taken care of in school and knows the window collapse there .	-6.8021
This is round by round , team by team .	-3.9347
You do not know the terms of the other side , but you can make it more consistent with any indication given by the cipher .	-8.0138
If it 's mysterious , but not too twisted , you might want to make it harder for your team .	-9.5919
The crypt of " Decrypto " is unfortunately the rule book .	-3.4276
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time before they can finally play .	-5.0057
The explanatory video on decrypto.info in the net makes it easier .	-3.0551
But once you start , you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game .	-5.4701
But overall " Decrypto " is not as conclusive as predecessors and Genre-Primus " codenames " , which also puts an agent theme on a game with fewer words but much better to play in small groups .	-6.0864
And if you are just talking about rates and not about victory points , you can easily invent a version for two .	-5.1393

A 48-year-old employed the police inspection at Kulmbach twice on the night of Saturday on Sunday .	-4.6764
First he showed the Hitler 's grudge in the Upper City of a passing police strike , then later he also fell in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests .	-6.6218
After he had to spend the night at the police station Kulmbach in the prison cell , he had to spend the night .	-7.6191

At the time , the Albachteners also made their displeasure .	-5.5307
At least five of them .	-0.7867
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir " Cäcilia " there should no longer be a life in the district .	-5.9538

This is not a problem for us .	-4.1512
I saw good volleyball at times , " Annacker didn 't complain with the 0 : 3 and went straight to the agenda .	-7.0193
After just three days of the match , it does not seem to be possible to see where the journey for the independents goes .	-6.7481
" It 's just too early for that , " says Axel Büring .	-2.9083

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody : Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband .	-1.5994
Heide Keller became a star on the " dream ship " .	-2.2677
Now she speaks openly that the series may have had a share of the blame for her marriage with Hans von Borsody .	-5.2476
Heide Keller ( 76 ) made her famous role as Chief Hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the " Traumschiff " , but on January 1 , 2018 she dropped out forever .	-4.7028
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody ( 1929 - 2013 ) , with whom she was married for ten years .	-3.2970
" That could also have been a reason .	-2.4942
Because I grew up with this work , traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many colleagues that I admired saw me on eye level , " Keller tells in conversation with the " picture on Sunday " .	-5.3814
At first she was always only " the wife of Hans von Borsody " , but that changed with the " dream ship " .	-4.0824
For now , the journalists have been calling only to Heide Keller .	-4.2403
" I don 't know if he liked it so much " .	-3.8369
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been jealous , but " like many men , Hans shunned talks about problems and feelings " .	-6.7194
Keller has always tried to be the only " right " for Hans von Borsody and he wanted to know my fears , my weaknesses .	-4.3972
That means in plain English : I have lost myself " as she continues to explain .	-6.0735
She always felt " not to be good enough for him .	-2.9239
He saw in me an emancipated woman , which in reality I never was , even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on the stage .	-5.5252
I wanted our love to be forever " .	-2.0584
After a failed marriage to Thomas Härtner , Keller said yes again , " although I was afraid that it could go wrong again " .	-4.0058
On the day before the civil wedding I sat in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything .	-5.2335
The marriage to Borsody also failed .	-3.7822
Why never went with the men ?	-3.3485
Because I wanted too much .	-0.8603
Keller imagined love at the time " as in the film .	-4.8397
Unfortunately , this vision is not everyday .	-1.9951

Our Falter is not a moth , but a bit light-shy .	-4.9144
And the glare , in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-pillar square , fades it too much .	-6.9123
But it 's all about the film festival , where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the headlights .	-5.9617
So on this late Thursday evening he torches over the square to make a short break in the " Aquaclean-WC oasis " .	-5.7220
This is the name of the public toilet facility , which is sponsored by a large sanitary company , which is celebrating its premiere at the festival : the needs-centre in the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to provide a luxurious ambience .	-8.4284
This evening , however , the men 's oasis stinks to the sky for some reason .	-5.6336
So out here , over the other street side : geladen guests who have just entertained the opening film " Green Book " at the best level in the cinema next door , celebrate the festival start as every year with a party in the three-storey department store .	-7.4654
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival : as you know , the works shown are from all over the world .	-5.1187

The Falter binds itself to a little brooch around the antennas , which has a good fairy for him , and two bully doorstewards actually wave him in generously .	-9.2202
Drinks are packed , they dance far after midnight to live music or can be set by DJ rhythms to which they beat each other and rinse with Cüpli exquisite appetizers .	-7.3781
In the souterrain delicatessen , oysters await slip mouths , next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut up , a chocolate fountain is bubbling .	-6.7968
And the hammer is : all the sales shelves of fully exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion .	-4.1567
This has been the case for years , so it seems to work without any big losses .	-4.2681
You have to love this country for it !	-3.1157
The Falter studies the sign at the escalator : " wear a long dress , please be careful on the escalator " .	-4.5206
If these are two separate instructions , he has missed the dress code .	-4.7674
But it is more of a conditioning construction , and it has certainly saved lives already .	-4.1460
In the housekeeping department on the upper floor the poultry kicks a cocktail prepared with espresso called " Golden Eye " , matching the festival award .	-5.6892
The price for the best drink is not necessarily determined by the mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself .	-5.1728
And George Clooney , who has been promoting this brand for years , is not here this evening either .	-3.2183
However , between local prominence , cash desk and kitchen articles , a face passes by , which the observer is familiar with : Peter Farrelly , the director of the opening film .	-7.4478
His main actor is probably not far away .	-4.9451
And really : Viggo Mortensen , soon sixty almost like a chorister , walks through the crowd retroactively .	-3.7218
It is not being quashed , it is not being nurtured , and at most it is being stealt.	-6.9411

Swen Bieletzki , Coach of the handball association ASV Senden , couldn 't believe it : " Such a bitter defeat " .	-5.1993
As in Steinhagen , like against Hülhorst , they did not play badly over long periods , the transmitters .	-5.1683
Only the initial phase " we were completely sleepy " , annoyed the ASV trainer .	-4.9427
The owners quickly managed with 8 : 1 , even the early time-out that Bieletzki had taken did not at first bear fruit .	-6.8821
" But then suddenly a rucksack went through the team " , Bieletzki summarized the second quarter of an hour .	-5.4176
For the break , the backlog was only two goals .	-3.1619
In particular , Sennn ’ s Beast , Marius Hintze , met each time in the phase .	-5.9563
After the change it became even better from a visitor 's point of view .	-3.9307
After 33 minutes David Ernst started the 15 : 15 , then the Staffelchanger ran almost completely .	-10.4254
Four minutes before the siren , the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits ( 29 : 26 ) .	-3.1147
And then ?	-0.7943
Invite the non-partisan to the action .	-4.2795
Bieletzki is usually wary of blaming others .	-2.8971
But : The 120-second penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received was " a joke " .	-3.4163
LIT had a good laugh and met four times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack .	-4.4029
The guys fought great , stood well at the back against seven men and threw them back to the empty goal .	-7.4881
But they can buy little for the compliments .	-3.0236

On Saturday , armed forces took a street with Marxgrün .	-5.2873
For this purpose , the street floor and several layers were removed , as the police and the public prosecutor shared .	-7.1058
New evidence suggests that the missing may have been buried not far from where they lived .	-4.7358
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986 .	-1.8283

He may remain CEO .	-2.9859
In the comparison , which still has to be confirmed by a court , neither Musk nor Tesla committed wrongdoing .	-4.2814

Already at 10 o 'clock the Bolids were placed in front of the entrance of the church .	-5.9065
At first , the biker ’ s early floats were on the agenda and it could be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a hearty currywurst .	-7.9030
In addition to the MoGo team , there were also the Holy Riders , a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach .	-3.0506
The sermon was held during the Biker service priest Dirk Grzegorek .	-3.6086
The singer songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical support .	-3.8771
" Although the bikers prefer the blues rock , Valerie Lill is more poetic-quiet , " says the pastor Frank Schröder .	-6.2302
This , too , was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday .	-3.9950
Beachtarfer Heimatverein celebrates a big festival : after the apple comes the milk .	-5.6228
Borisch was also active at the actual day of action .	-2.9167
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes .	-2.6293
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest .	-2.3756
He had his apple press in his bag and gradually demonstrated to his astonished audience the process from the ripe apple to apple juice .	-4.2446
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnel .	-3.7710
With a little muscle power the apples became a finely chopped mass .	-3.6574
Not many of the children could yet imagine how to turn this into a tasty drink .	-4.8431
However , they were also able to take a look at this important step forward this late Friday afternoon .	-4.7243
packed in shapes and wrapped by nets , Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little bit like a Häckgelgood-looking apple piece layer on top of each other .	-6.7256
Thanks to some technical support , the last step was no longer so difficult .	-3.7911
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large container .	-3.0793
But the Füchtor farmer also had already completed specialities .	-4.7589
He opened his " treasure chest " and presented the latest feather white to older visitors .	-4.4643
The demand for the good drop " Made in Füchdorf " was correspondingly great .	-3.2790
In a cosy atmosphere the parents met together , while the children could not only follow the process of pressing the apple , but also discovered the built bouncer for themselves .	-7.7545
Active members of the Füchtorfer Cameraljaft former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games .	-7.5511
In the coming year , the Heimatverein will also offer a day of action .	-5.8242
But then , as Gregor Krüttzkamp pointed out , the home house in the heart of the Savings Bank will not be the place of the event .	-6.2603
Instead , a farm will be visited .	-0.9673
This is also obvious because of the issue : after all , the milk will be around .	-5.5253
1 : 4 versus Frankfurt : Hannover , with its fourth season bust : " Cause situation "	-5.3025
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row , coach André Breitenreiter met his disappointed pros of Hannover 96 and gave them courage .	-5.5684
However , there were many positive things not seen before at 1 : 4 ( 0 : 2 ) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt .	-5.1871
" It is a cunning situation , but you have to come out as a team , " said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and shot down : " That is , of course , disappointing , because you always think a lot " .	-7.0288
The further winners of Lower Saxony , for which only Florent Muslim ( 86 ) met , stand at the bottom with two meters and are in their current constitution a relegation candidate .	-6.7640
Led by the towering Ante Rebic , Frankfurt , on the other hand , celebrated its first season home victory .	-4.8276
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute , Rebic ( 45th + 1 ) , Jonathan de Guzmán ( 59th ) and Luka Jovic ( 89th ) won the goals for the DFB Cup winner before 46,300 spectators , who scored seven points in the middle of the table after the successful general test for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome .	-5.8535
Croatia ’ s Vice-World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive by the Hessen and never got under control of Hanover ’ s defence .	-6.0363
The striker , long after the World Cup , showed with his speed and perseverance why he is so valuable for harmony .	-6.0973
In addition to Rebic , Brazilian Allan , hired by Liverpool FC , was the first time in the opening formation of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange , which began with enthusiasm .	-7.8598
A headball intercepted on the Tornet by Lucas Torró ( 17 ) was the first to pose a threat .	-6.1635
Six minutes later , Sébastien Haller , in a promising position , was stopped at the last moment by the 96-defense against the Brazilian Felipe , who replaced the short-lived Kevin Wimmer ( back ) .	-4.9684
Leaders were almost inevitable and fully deserved .	-4.3185
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty room after a broken corner , Haller extended per head in front of the gate , where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot .	-5.7274
It was the first Bundesliga squad for the French second league player AJ Auxerre , who came in the summer .	-6.4624
And Frankfurt followed before the break .	-2.5497
This time Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic , who skilfully refueled his way through and 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser didn ’ t get a chance .	-7.0107
In the half-time Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his team and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt .	-3.7155
Although Lower Saxony now played a little bolder forward , pioneering ideas remained until just before the end , when the final meeting was still successful .	-9.3094
Hessen were much more efficient .	-2.5189
After less than an hour Rebic started a solo and then placed right across De Guzmán , who had to push the ball into the empty goal .	-5.7355
The rest was only a show run for the Frankfurt people against overcharged guests , Jovic also met one minute before the end .	-6.7330
The Morlaix Square Goes to Party Mile	-2.8702
Würselen Despite cool temperatures , there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre .	-5.3220

Geisinger : Geisinger Christen feieren Heiligen-Kreuz-Fest	-2.8887
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Heiligen-Kreuz-Fest on September 14 or Sunday thereafter .	-3.6006
The festive service takes place in the town church , then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing .	-5.8510
The Holy Cross Church is home to the dead Christ , who came from the 30-year war and who according to legend was shot by a Swedish soldier .	-7.0286
Blood then flowed out of the sore wound . , , , , and . , and .	-7.9363
This led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church .	-4.7410
This is still not finished , only the altar is standing , the missing Langhaus is hinted by the trees .	-6.5376
In his sermon pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope , of comfort and of life . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.9002
Despite the importance of the Geisinger Parish , the service was poorly attended .	-3.6468
After the divine service , the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the Holy Cross ended .	-6.4579
For many years the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting to the secular part of the festival to the Catholic Parish House .	-5.5594
The members of the choir provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted , farm ice .	-4.9716
In the afternoon , the parish offered guided tours around the town church , Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger , on behalf of the parish community , informed visitors about the damage to the façade , roof , sandstone works and windows , as well as the construction work that is to be done , which will continue to be carried out until next year .	-8.0738
Since the scaffolding has been around for some time , it has been possible to establish the damage more precisely and to prepare the individual tenders more specifically .	-6.3543
What is certain is that renovation is more expensive than planned , because the damage that already existed a few years ago has increased , but more has been discovered , which was only made possible by using scaffolding .	-6.6995
The socle protection work is finished , the natural stone work is to be started before the winter , and it is hoped that we will be able to complete half of this work this year .	-10.5837
Inauguration : New Home in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße	-2.3560
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße .	-3.2022
The fact that in Münsterblickstraße now a very special house will be handed over to its purpose - there were all those present at the time of the inauguration .	-12.6301
Finally , the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residential home of the life aid Donau-Iller for some time already depend on the special architecture of the new building .	-5.3409
Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account the concept of wide corridors , corridors and doors , larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas .	-4.8029
The first plans began about eight years ago , when the former officer building of the US Army was put to the test for the inhabitants of Handycap : " The house had come into the years and had become outdated in its equipment , " Bader explained in retrospect .	-7.6507
In 2016 , the diggers advanced to demolish the house .	-3.1008
The new building should be as bright and friendly as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it , according to the architect .	-5.6879
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller Eröffnung neuer Wohnheim	-6.2917
About EUR 4.6 million was invested in the new building .	-3.7364
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros , the district of Swabia 450000 euros .	-4.3173
According to architect Bader , the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money .	-4.6726
The Managing Director of Lebenshilfe , Jürgen Heinz , also thanked him for this .	-3.1756
The gap between a barrier-free and fire-proof construction was not always easy .	-3.5273
Nevertheless , the planners and artisans had set up a home with the many guidelines that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help .	-7.5929
Similarly , Gertrud Kreutmayer , the head of the Swabian Social Administration , said : " The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants , who need tools to be mobile " .	-5.6247
As Kreutmayer said , the housing and functionality were well combined .	-4.4771
And again : " The property in this position is a real stroke of luck because it is no longer available in the present situation " .	-6.7243
Altogether , the new residential home in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square metres , divided into three residential groups .	-5.5257
Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees , all of whom are employed according to tariff .	-6.8886
Germany : Sweeping laments differences between East and West	-4.8852
Berlin - On the eve of the Day of Unity , the Deputy Federal Chairman of the SPD , Manuela Schwesig , appealed to all countrymen not to settle for discrimination against East Germans .	-6.7853
There are differences that , after nearly 30 years , hurt unity .	-2.8057
We must not be satisfied with these differences , " said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania at the " Tagesspiegel am Sonntag " .	-4.5246
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country .	-2.7069
It is unacceptable that East Germany worked longer , on average , than West Germany ’ s people , but received 15 % less .	-4.5815
" I cannot explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity , " said Schwesig .	-3.2434
North Korea : Does this clean dog stop the Korean conflict ?	-2.5223
The one-year Pungsan hunting dog should smooth the waves between the two Koreas .	-3.3845
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul , Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae a present in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs .	-3.3382
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday , the two dogs about a year old reached their destination on Thursday .	-5.3535
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food in order to make it easier for the animals to " weave " .	-7.9170
The dogs with the thick white coat , sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent .	-2.5415
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .	-2.4318
The North announced its commitment to friendship at this year ’ s third summit between Moon and North Korea ’ s leader , Kim Jong-un , in mid-September in Pyongyang .	-10.2885
Both countries also agreed to compete in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and jointly apply for the 2032 Olympic Games .	-4.3214
In the process , Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines . , , , and the , .	-8.7141
Austria ’ s Warming History in Mirror of 99 Documents	-2.4497
What is Austria ?	-0.4127
To mark the 100th anniversary of the Republic , which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for nearly ten months now , numerous new books have been published , mostly in retrospect to the last hundred years .	-6.6025
Wolfgang Maderthaner , historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives , does it differently in the magnificent " Bilderbuch " Austria , which will be published on October 1 .	-5.9610
New Week , New Chance for the Government	-1.8426
Back to the work of the substance - that is the unofficial motto of the Great Coalition 's working week , which is beginning today .	-5.4475
Hardly an interview , hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU , the SPD and also from the CSU did not , in the last instance , summon the " return to the work of Sakharov " in a mantra .	-6.9606
This may have led some artisans , doctors , cashiers and other working citizens in that country to the legitimate question of what actually is the difference between work and work , but so be it .	-5.5494
When the Federal Government is ready to return to its task of governing , it should not be stopped by discussing terms now .	-5.5834
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do anything together after the provocations and bubbles of recent weeks may be demonstrated by Monday .	-5.2816
In the evening , the leaders of the governing parties come together to the coalition committee .	-3.4942
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflict early , a lesson from all the dispute .	-3.8359
First of all , however , the issue of diesel upgrades and the law on the transfer of skilled labour is once again on the list . of , , , , , , , and .	-8.8189
The CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car manufacturers to get off scot-free with conversion premiums , and the SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as being obliged to retrofit older diesel .	-6.8988
While a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis over the weekend , the EU and the SPD are still far apart in the planned trade immigration law .	-6.6266
The SPD calls for a permanent perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or train .	-4.8435
The Union is strongly opposed to the ' change of track ' from the asylum system to the labour market .	-2.8015
So there will again be disputes between the coalition partners - and how else should it be ?	-4.0619
It is not the same thing that the GroKo has joined forces , but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities .	-6.9683
Dispute is good .	-2.6088
Without dispute , a society drawn from such diverse and sometimes conflicting interests will not progress .	-4.4995
In order to be constructive , however , disputes must not be broken up again for party political reasons on the question of being or not .	-5.3980
It is still about politics , not about theater .	-2.5674
The Union and the SPD are supposed to fight - but always keep in mind the reality of life .	-6.9619
What is feasible and useful to many ?	-1.9765
With this key question , both diesel and track change issues can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence .	-4.8415
That is what the parties must fight for now .	-3.7661
Pilz Checks Working Time for Hartinger	-3.1385
Minister in Target	-1.2393
Does the Minister of Labour , of all people , violate the law of service ?	-5.0668
Daniela Holzinger will take a closer look at this .	-2.1496
" Really day and night " would have their legislatures worked on social security reform , reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago .	-5.8223
Daniela Holzinger 's Liste-Pilz-Mandatorin is surprised by the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein ( FPÖ ) - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question .	-5.1574
They assume that ' the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and in no way to announce violations of the current law of service in front of cameras ' .	-8.8062
Nevertheless , she now has questions to " free Har ­ tinger from any suspicion " .	-4.5937
Police are tearing up a street in search of women ’ s bodies .	-5.2392
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this .	-3.8253
There is now confirmation .	-1.6694
Since early Saturday morning , the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug .	-4.5721
The track is closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday .	-4.1009
It was preceded by the investigators who had previously used a archaeology dog .	-5.2046
The dog , specially trained for the smell of old human bones , together with his guide , was able to limit the relevant place to a few meters .	-5.8181
In addition , a soil anomalie has been discovered in the area of the street in question , together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority .	-5.6347
For more than a year now , the Public Prosecutor and the Criminal Police Court have been working on the case of missing persons .	-4.5206
Again and again a cycle path has been closed to Marxgr and studied with sonars , because investigators suspect that Heike ’ s body could have been buried here as the state road was rebuilt 30 years ago .	-7.2968
Color powder and eggs : Riyves in Barcelona before Catalonia ’ s anniversary	-4.9430
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia .	-1.5285
But there are ties before that .	-4.0833
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the autumn of 2017 .	-2.2552
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1 , 2017 , clashes between separatists and the police took place in the centre of Barcelona .	-3.9142
Catalonia ’ s security forces were attacked by pro-independence campaigners , including color powder , in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and Civil Guard .	-4.8151
Some 3000 police officers of the National Police and the Civil Guard wanted to honour their colleagues in a rally last year in the polling stations that were deemed illegal .	-7.2936
Violence also occurred at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting .	-4.2099
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces separate , reported Spanish media .	-4.0033
Some of the roughly 6,000 separatists , however , would have been violent in attempting to break the police chain and , among other things , canvassing officials with paint bags and eggs .	-6.7160
Six people were arrested and 24 others were easily injured , as the authorities said .	-5.0783
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum .	-1.4780
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain , the central government in Madrid forced Catalonia to be administered in the fall of 2017 .	-3.8978
The then regional president , Carles Puigdemont , fled into exile in Belgium .	-2.6445
Other politicians also resigned abroad .	-3.1226
On the other hand , several ministers from the then regional government and other separatist activists are still in U-prison .	-4.5789
In December , new elections were held in the region .	-4.5160
After the new Catalan government took office in May , the forced administration ended .	-2.9213
But the new regional president , Quim Torra , also insists on the " right to self-determination " of Catalans .	-2.6497
FC Gütersloh ( FC Gütersloh ) and RW Ahlen ( FC Gütersloh ) play in the Bundesliga .	-8.0267
Red White Ahlen continues on the spot .	-3.3736
The FC Gütersloh won only a 0 : 0 draw .	-5.4815
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidemwaldstadion , they turned out to be a general helplessness .	-7.1461
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor .	-2.8022
Those who wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst could not worry about this .	-5.9599
There was no danger of missing a goal chance , because there were virtually none .	-4.1689
First Shot after Half an Hour	-3.0488
Freightsloh Nick Flock was responsible for the first ( harmless ) goal shot of the entire game .	-4.3296
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility was the Ahlener , when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westernerling was forced into a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the prison limits .	-6.6245
The hosts were even more harmless .	-2.0759
Their most effective action was an early change .	-2.5976
Serious Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury , for him came Sinan Aygün .	-4.1751
After the change , both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom .	-3.6166
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mürtzel was aiming at just over the housing from 18 meters , and after one hour the freight sloters also appeared offensive for the first time .	-8.0548
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz it went fix .	-2.5117
Nick Flock ( 62 ) crowned the quickly performed Konter over Sinan Aygün with a soft shot into the arms of Bernd Schipmann , the RWA commissioner .	-5.9855
In addition , they played Wieckowicz ( 66th ) after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein .	-5.5205
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted , initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy ( 60 ) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mürtzel ( 70 ) .	-3.7801
It did - nothing .	-1.3911
The Ahleners did not achieve anything more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative .	-4.1450
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance , but also that did not get anything .	-7.5989
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive : " I like the fact that we played to zero " , but unfortunately the zero was in front of the .	-5.8195
" This time we were not as torhazardous as we were against wooden windings and that even though our opponent had no desire to play here " , stated RW Ahlen 's interim trainer .	-6.5722
Offensively " all of this smashed a bit " against a team that just wanted to defend .	-6.7606
In any case , I did not feel that we could get an opposite , " Daut said .	-4.7906
Unfortunately , as a spectator , one did not feel that his team could score a goal .	-5.4803
The idea was too feeble .	-3.2953
Reckenfeld Harvest Market : Luckily enough Kreimers	-2.9270
Brigitte Ransmann , Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table dispenser , for which these donations are intended .	-3.6562
The Honorary Assemblies : " These donations remain in Reckenfeld " .	-4.9251
At the opening the sky was shining blue , but the square was still a little empty , but that should change in the course of the day .	-5.8896
Because : " Here it is so nice to socialise , so we are here today , " one visitor said .	-5.7841
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holhouse welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent dose of humour .	-5.0977
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer quickly intervened for Brockmann , who was supposed to be balanced against food .	-5.1821
Verena ( daughter of Ferdi Kreimer ) became ill .	-2.2508
But there are enough chalmers .	-2.7335
And the " replacement " could not take it away to entertain the increasingly growing visitors in between musically .	-5.9550
This was so good that at a late hour some folk songs were sung .	-4.9133
" Just great " , Marcel Kreimer was happy .	-2.5965
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date in his schedule this time .	-3.3998
He is happy about the many activities with their stands , mostly clubs .	-5.0112
" Actually there should be no such thing as a table at all , " he thanked for the action of the male choir .	-4.3344
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who were in use at the booths and included the other festivals that took place in September and the " Clean up " campaign .	-5.9575
Our garden town has a colourful coat of paint - here you can do something .	-6.0190
Then the Maikraz of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was taken off with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the Winterquartier .	-4.5750
Many booths were used for bodily well-being .	-4.3922
From sweetness to heart detention was everything to have .	-4.7964
Stefan Hagemeyer , who has been living in Reckenfeld for only a year , has been creative at his decompression saw .	-5.1209
He offered veneer works , coasters with reckenfields motives and a lot more .	-6.1586
Three reckenfields of beekeepers offered a specialty : " Reckenfeld Honey " , brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka , Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschslu.	-4.6779
The latter has another speciality .	-3.0217
Honey cake in glass , of course with honey from my own production .	-2.5537
The little Elsa had to access again and again , so good the cake tasted .	-4.7562
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours , even without a stage programme that does not exist during the autumn festival .	-6.3693
Lubrications with a local-policy message : No Successful Advertising for a Skate Plant	-8.9624
In Len , unknowns have hardly promoted the construction of a skatepark .	-4.5259
In several places , according to Jürgen Kohne of the City Council at the TN ’ s request , there are appropriate lubrications .	-6.7778
In at least one case , the police have been charged with property damage .	-3.1948
The three words " Skatepark für Len ! " are written in large letters on signs at the Gempt-Halle and at the Alte Rathaus ( Old Town Hall ) .	-5.4323
Michael Rottmann , manager of the hall , reports that an appropriate inscription has already been discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro after the trade fair on 19 September .	-5.5858
Since the short message was apparently left " only " with an Edding , it was easy to remove it .	-5.6103
" A few days later , however , this was back , this time sprayed up " , says Rottmann .	-4.9527
It assumes that the appropriate advertising sign must be replaced .	-3.5226
This case is particularly marked by the fact that several large companies are also called Len on the blackboard .	-6.5592
If the skatepark is built , its realization should also be made possible by sponsors .	-4.0175
Promises already exist , explained Jörg Hesselmann of the municipal department of school , sport and culture , without naming names .	-4.7998
It is possible , however , that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies on the receiving board .	-4.8314
For years , local politics and administration have been working on the subject of skatepark .	-5.4186
After the old one had been mined at the LWL clinic , after some time the search for an alternative location began .	-4.8658
Finally , the majority of the Council was in favour of the fire parking lot .	-4.9533
However , this request has not been made - too many factors seem to have spoken out against building here .	-5.7961
A U-turn followed at the end of June .	-2.1180
The members of the General and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area .	-3.3174
As far as the state of affairs is concerned , Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning .	-4.1388
The last word then has the city council .	-3.0569
He assumes a decision this year , so that a positive vote could be built in 2019 .	-3.9704
Closing Air Traffic	-8.8947
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer , German air traffic controllers see no sign of improvement next year .	-3.0953
" This year we had wind , in 2019 we will have a strong wind and then the storm comes , " said Matthias Maas , head of the Air Navigation Union , the German Press Agency , ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October .	-6.4575
One important reason for the many delays and flight cancellations is the long-established staffing shortage of European air traffic control systems , for which there is no quick solution .	-6.7207
" Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year , but training for new pilots takes four to five years , " said the trade unionist .	-3.6721
The market for pre-trained pilots should be empty across Europe .	-3.9685
Just in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace , there were around a hundred people missing .	-4.7190
Maas again criticised the fact that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit .	-2.8468
In the Hanseatic city , representatives of the federal government , countries , air traffic control , airlines and airports meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays .	-4.4664
" If you want to talk about additional work densification and overtime , this will not be possible without us , " explained the head of the GdF , who has many members at the German Air Traffic Administration .	-6.5157
Maas again blamed EU Commission guidelines for pilotage .	-3.3928
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low .	-2.9293
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings in national air safety schemes are now taking full advantage of the operational business .	-6.7677
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer ( CSU ) to work in Brussels for regulations that ' do not cut off air traffic further ' .	-5.9161
At the moment , EU targets would be agreed by 2024 and there is a risk of further tightening .	-5.2786
The EU is under constant pressure from airlines to lobby .	-2.1113
" Michael O 'Leary , Ryanair CEO and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years , " said Maas .	-4.4617
He hopes that the high cost of delay on the part of airlines will lead to a change .	-4.4957
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if the German Air Traffic Administration ( DFS ) offers a " coherent training and future pact " , said Maas .	-3.8795
The announcement to date that 120 pilot students will be admitted every year over the next five years is sufficient to compensate for the absences due to age .	-6.3257
The necessary staff building is not yet connected .	-5.9092
ThyssenKrupp ’ s Supervisory Board Votes for Group Restoration	-7.9621
The members of the ThyssenKrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to restructure the Group .	-3.5104
According to the will of ThyssenKrupp Interim Chairman Guido Kerkhoff , who was appointed Chairman of the Board at Sunday ’ s meeting , the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is to be split into two separate companies .	-6.0278
Both companies shall be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange .	-2.7933
There should be no further reduction in staffing beyond the administrative cuts already known .	-4.5671
After two resignations , the control panel counts only eight heads on the capital side .	-3.6599
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this .	-4.2256
However , the final decision is expected to be taken at the Annual General Meeting in 2020 .	-3.2924
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include , among other things , the 50 % share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata .	-4.4049
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrias AG , the business with lifts and suppliers is to be bundled .	-4.9892
Barcelona : violence in demos of police and Catalan independence advocates .	-2.9728
Two simultaneous demonstrations in Barcelona by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence campaigners have led to violent clashes with many injured .	-4.5161
According to the city council , on Saturday around 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered , as did some 6,000 pro-independence protesters .	-6.0091
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protest movements out of each other with a big band .	-6.7245
But , according to the forces , pro-independence campaigners repeatedly tried to break the safety gap .	-4.3168
They would have attacked officials with paint and bullets .	-2.9828
According to the figures , there were also differences between the participants in the various protests .	-4.6636
According to rescue forces , 24 people were injured .	-2.1403
The police said there were six arrests .	-2.1544
Better salaries and pay for colleagues	-3.3574
With their demonstration , the police wanted to pay tribute to those colleagues who fought almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia .	-5.5995
At the same time , they demanded better salaries .	-1.9035
Members of the Spanish police and the Civil Guard find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do .	-3.7830
The demonstrators saw it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona , of all places .	-3.9208
" Why did they come here to protest ? " asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of AFP news agency .	-2.9593
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago .	-3.0118
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands , who wanted to give his name only with Daniel , dismissed the accusation .	-4.6665
" Of course we want to support our comrades who last year only did their duty : defend the law , " he said .	-2.5415
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights , and we are doing it in Barcelona , because it is a great European city and there is more echo here .	-4.8416
He and his colleagues " did not come to provoke " , the policeman asserted .	-4.3252

The Portuguese star striker " played the best match this evening together with the half hour of Valencia " , praised Jude-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3 : 1 ( 1 : 1 ) victory of the record master against the SSC Naples .	-5.9094
For the coach , the heavily bought star was the decisive man in the important match against the tracker even without his own goal .	-5.6606
" Ronaldo had much fun and makes it good , " said Allegra .	-3.4901
Although we started with tactical mistakes , Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown .	-4.1046
In the end , Juve was able to play the game with the help of Ronaldo 's three goalhands , with the of Dries Mertens ( 10 minutes ) and suspended from the .	-14.4461
Real Madrid ’ s goalkeeper , Mario Mandzukic , was a former Bundesliga pro , who took the lead with a double pack ( 26 / 49 ) .	-7.6707
And Ronaldo did the groundwork for the hit of Bonucci ( 76 ) , who had to push in just before the goal line .	-7.7424
" He gives many templates , " praised the coach .	-2.0229
But Allegri also wants to see goals of the attacker who is the record defender in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team .	-5.2525
" We need to be even better at serving him , " the coach demanded .	-3.8777
Best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account .	-3.8192
With Ronaldo ’ s purchase of more than € 100 million , Juventus ’ overpower seems to be even more overwhelming .	-5.8041
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series A. At 21 points , the master of the past seven years has already six meters ahead of Naples .	-5.5998
The second table , trained by former coach Carlo Ancelotti , was not without a chance against Turin .	-5.6679
But at the latest after the previous Mario Rui ( 58th ) refused to take place , the top team was determined .	-9.3924
The Portuguese had to get in against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square after getting in .	-6.3388
" We played well against a good Naples " , commented the Turin Coach .	-2.4824
Emre Can was able to feel talked about .	-5.5872
The German national player won Juve .	-4.7376
The professional who came from Liverpool FC was in action with all seven league games .	-5.5349
The midfield player also played in the Champions League match against Valencia , which Allegri meant with the " half hour " : Ronaldo had flown out of the place with the 2 : 0 victory of the Turin people and was closed to the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern .	-7.8597
Kanye West Changing Its Name	-1.8881
Rapper Kanye West made a special appearance at the US TV show Saturday Night Live at the weekend .	-5.5732
Among other things , his performance together with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused eyebrows and question marks to the audience .	-4.7641
In addition , the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album .	-3.1953
From then on , he can only be called " Ye " , according to the musician .	-5.0638
" The essence of what used to be known as Kanye West , " he tweeted along the lines of the late Prince , when he derived his artist name .	-6.1580
The pseudonym is not news , however .	-2.7404
Already the tenth album was released under this name .	-2.2308
In an interview with radio station KRL , the artist explained that " Ye " has a religious meaning for him .	-3.3424
" I think " Ye " is the most frequently used word in the Bible and there it means " you " , according to the rapper .	-2.7308
Football : Circular League A1 Münster : Finally !	-2.5625
Create !	-3.3846
Hoetmar ’ s trainer Average made no secret of his disappointment .	-2.0810
That was a weak game of us today .	-2.7540
The opponent was just more at hand , we almost never put him into trouble " .	-7.6296
Grade two goal chances in 90 minutes , this rarely makes games positive .	-5.6642
Football Circuit League A1 : SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sennhorst with 0 : 2 ( 0 : 1 ) photo : Heinz Schweckenberg .	-2.8789
Even the SG had only two possibilities in the first pass , the first but used Maik Krause from a pointed angle to the early guidance ( 7 ) .	-4.7220
In the 43rd minute , Steffen Uphus could have increased , but after great preparatory work he agreed to stand freely .	-6.9640
The hosts had only a double opportunity when Moritz Höne , Torsteuer Jos Schuhmacher , failed and Jan Blome , who was the last member of the broadcaster , also found his master .	-9.2965
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances .	-2.7596
But Uphus ( 49th ) , Julian Turl ( 61 , ) and Heinz Linnemann ( 69th ) all gave in . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.3212
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the doorway and saw red for it - also Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests ( 75 ) .	-5.7598
Only when Nils Berheide stoked the ball over the line was the game decided ( 81 ) .	-3.2794
" We had criticised ourselves hard before , but that was different today than in the last few weeks " , was the conclusion of Florian Kraus .	-5.6376
Sennhorst : J. Schomacher - Linnemann , Scholz , Eilmann , Mey , Kraus , Krause ( 77th Berheide ) , L. Hartleif , Uphus , Abu Dalal ( 90th Leibig ) , Turl .	-2.3556

Football : Regional League A2 Münster : Spectacle Football in Albeighth : GW Albersloh is Concordia with 3 : 4 .	-5.0514
" I don 't know what to think of it , " he prayed for words .	-4.0248
" We don 't have access to them at all , " he probably meant the wing length with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger , but also all the other green whites with a collective offensive drive .	-6.2776
He was able to laugh : " A dirty victory , " he said , " cheeky and cheeky , and attracted by danish players , on the other hand , was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points .	-9.6952
Remember , after a duel between two teams , one of which , Albahten , is playing for the championship and the other , Albersloh , is fighting for the class preservation .	-5.8127
With understandably mixed feelings , GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him .	-3.0928
" That was by far our best season performance , " he says .	-2.1591
" How we come back after the 0 : 2 , how we stand against one of the league 's top teams over the entire game time , that was really phenomenal " .	-5.8605
All the more bitter the fact that you now have to go home empty-handed .	-5.1875
Top goalier Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season event ( 24 ) .	-5.1719
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal .	-3.2276
He placed the 2 : 0 exemplary on the left side for Fabian Fröhning ( 39 . ) .	-3.9427
We knew that , but you cannot take a player out of it completely .	-5.5846
" That was madness , what he did , " Lewandowski recognized the quality of his opponent 's jealously .	-5.7946
Shortly before the side change , his own team made the difference : McGill ’ s free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia ’ s orbiter Hinkerohe through to the long Toreck ( 45th ) .	-7.5134
After the side change it was again McGill who achieved the compensation ( 59 . ) .	-4.8812
Then it went back and forth .	-3.5847
It was a fast , action-packed game .	-2.7403
In the early days of his career , Horstmann returned to England , where he worked as a consultant to the Royal Navy .	-15.9765
Albersloh was able to beat the last Concordia match ( 80th ) again .	-8.5788
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday .	-2.3319

Music Cabaret : Heart of Gender Understanding - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten	-3.7972
" Suitable for both adults and men " was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck .	-3.4321
As cabarettestin , Teubner imagined gender understanding , not only with humour and warmth of heart for the ( perceived ) woman and man and whatever else there might be , but also with music .	-6.0529
The mini-guitar set her in and also mastered her violin .	-3.8564
Ben Süskub sat at the wing .	-3.2741
On the one hand , he is the male sparring partner , who sometimes comes to words even to the end of the sentence , and on the other a true pianist : so congenially accompanied by Süschub Teubner that some may have wished for a solo .	-6.5845
This was also the case , with Beethoven and Chopin , but in a different way , in the way it fit the red thread of the evening .	-6.3723
Teubner had brought into play a paradox : the man ’ s satisfaction comes when he has a partner , but does not open the door .	-5.6050
A closed door without partner , on the other hand , does not bring any benefit .	-3.8999
The piano piano piano piano now demonstrates the same : What would have arisen from Mozart 's composing had " the Nannerl " unexpectedly opened the door ?	-4.7096
In this way , atonement glides over into improvisations , from Bach 's " O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden " to the " Lied von Tod " , and from Mozart g-Moll 's Symphony into a playful dance .	-5.6652
There were great applause and ' bravo ' from the full Chamber .	-3.7118

But he was more angry about the many missed opportunities .	-4.5002
His final focus was missed this time .	-3.9717
The ASG therefore lagged behind almost to the end , at 11 : 12 and later at 15 : 18 ( 45 ) .	-5.9185
It was only towards the end that the broader bank of hosts made a decisive impact .	-4.6508

We have occupied them well .	-2.9016
Our adversary received a high risk ticket , as well as several tickets .	-7.2923
In the second sentence the BSV already stated at 12 : 8 " Essen has changed the assumption to triple bars .	-6.4551
We were unable to keep up the pressure of publicity .	-4.0716
Eating was not easy , and we let ourselves be lulled a bit , " Münch continued .	-8.4690
At 18 : 17 the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their nose ahead for the first time .	-4.3315
Although Ostbevern still fought four batches at 19 : 24 , the fifth attempt nevertheless found its goal .	-6.6354
" The game was now a better class , " said the leader to the rising level .	-5.0144

Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the opportunity to make a joint , conciliatory appearance .	-3.2715
" Instead of underlining Muslims ' membership of Germany side by side with German leaders , Erdogan used the date for his purposes , " complained Sofuoglu .	-4.5882

At the time , however , he was called another : as " district fruit farm association Kulmbach Stadt und Land " , he was baptized by mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893 .	-6.0052
The purpose of the association was also different from today 's work - in fact it was only about fruit cultivation , no one thought about flowers and horticulture at that time .	-7.0846
" At that time , in the time of the Enlightenment , the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites , " explained district carers Günter Dippold in his lecture .	-3.6597

He guided the many visitors through the long history of the district association and reported among other things about the need for self-sufficiency after the war .	-5.7771
In the past everything came from the garden , for the winter it was dosed in .	-4.2056
At the end of the 1950s , however , the garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden .	-4.2055
" Nature has continued , it was already there before us and we have to follow it " , the expert argued for fruit and nut trees .	-6.1979
That is why the horticultural associations are encouraged not to let up in order to keep our home beautiful and worth living .	-6.1215
The President of the Bavarian Association , Wolfram Vaitl , has also welcomed the new citizens in our clubs .	-4.4097

This is , for example , the pressing air hammers level , but it is still significantly lower than the " Wacken-designed " , which " The Ignition " refers to on its website .	-9.2041
On this rock night , however , the Ahlen audience does not need to be stunned by 120 decibels in jet drive strength as is the case with the annual metal statement in the north of the republic .	-8.7411

And then we fell in love .	-1.2135

No , really .	-1.6457
And it is not only talks with Kim that would have melted his heart .	-3.4310
He wrote me beautiful letters , they were great letters .	-2.8353
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit : Trump pointed to Kim ’ s announcement that all nuclear and missile tests will stop , even though critics have seen little more than lip service .	-4.9977
The US president seemed well aware that the affection for whether his notorious “ Rocket Man ” – Trump ’ s nickname for Kim – might not be more cherished .	-5.5215
In any case , he anticipated the expected criticism of this at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling : " Donald Trump says they have fallen in love " .	-5.1937
How terrible , how terrible is that ?	-2.1041
It is so presidential .	-2.2155
But he did not care much , Trump declared , and then pointed his finger at the crowd : " I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential . "	-8.1106
But then we would not have 10 000 people out there in this crowded arena , only 200 people out there .	-4.6120

In the federal debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals , on 30 June 2017 , Kahr had caused a stir with a wave of rage .	-9.7661

The days become shorter - this is what burglars want to take advantage of .	-3.8494
The police inspectorate Gauting reported yesterday the first attempt to break in this autumn .	-5.9181
The alarm system is due to the fact that it remained on Königswieser Straße during the attempt at a one-family house .	-6.1136
It started when the perpetrators handed their hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.	-6.2447

Hertha Bust : From Reality : Bayern vs. Ajax	-7.5588
The title is unbeatable : FC Bayern will not let the defeat in Berlin down .	-5.8762
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate step for Niko Kovac ’ s term of office .	-3.7001
The first small performance of the new Coach Niko Kovac is not intended for the Munich ones to become a bigger autumn low .	-7.2531
" A week ago we had the impression that we were invincible .	-3.3070
Now the reality has caught us a bit " , Thomas Müller noted after his deserved 0 : 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam .	-6.1351
Anyone who knows us knows that we are really annoyed by this and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday .	-5.3672
For the first time in more than a year out no own goal was scored , as at the same time the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory , the table leadership in the Bundesliga was lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund .	-7.2015
The overall picture is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti in late September 2017 , but the record master must be warned .	-4.4946
The FC Augsburg at 1 : 1 with its running intensive mann-on-man tactics and the Berliner with their playful needle-stick over the outside delivered two blueprints within three days , just like the last overpowering Bavaria are to be cracked .	-9.3052
" Those who know FC Bayern know that we don 't like it and we will do everything we can to make it happen again , " said Kovac .	-5.7779
But he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native town , and his first defeat as a Munich coach merely pushed for the anew flawed management of opportunity .	-8.2215
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim answer of his term of office positive before the country break - otherwise the tone will probably get worse .	-5.6307
For example , Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second premier class appearance of this season after Benfica Lisbon .	-5.3995
After the free day on Sunday , as planned , the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax , which at the start of AEK Athens also had a sovereign defeat with 3 : 0 .	-7.1078
" Now we are caught in two matches , but we will also be making our gates again , " announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer .	-7.0867
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place Joshua Kimmich spoke Klartext .	-5.8296
The legal defender appeared as a reminder .	-4.7234
" I don 't think this is bad luck , we have to work out it again , because we don 't make the variety of opportunities and make the mistakes at the back , " the 23-year-old stressed just before leaving the Olympic Stadium .	-7.2959
On the seventh day of the previous season , the Bayern team was even behind Dortmund by five meters , which has now taken the lead again by one point .	-7.8799
And so , with a wink , Kimmich valued at least positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end .	-5.6431
" Yes , that 's good , " said the national player .	-4.0248
It is good for the league .	-2.8522
DFB Boss in the firing line : Özil-Causa : Erdogan ’ s Sharp Attack on Grindel	-3.8668

The DFB-President Grindel sees mistakes , but defends the association line .	-8.2622
Now a new post is to be created .	-2.3441
Berlin - On various stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in Mesut Özil ’ .	-4.4322
After the Turkish President violently criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne , the DFB head defended the association line .	-5.2826
On the early Sunday morning Özil personally attacked Grindel at Mainzer 's ZDF " Sportstudio " announced consequences from the Causa .	-5.3243
" In the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - we must draw very close conclusions that this is not repeated , " said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player with no migration background as another integration officer .	-7.7704
At the same time , Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB .	-2.6228
He had harshly denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan .	-3.2820
Our german born and grown Mesut Özil and our Ilkay .	-2.9970
They excluded them from this society because they were allowed to photograph with me in England , " Erdogan said in the Cathedral City on Saturday .	-3.8080
Frankly , as its President , I could not digest the fact that our two young men , who have risen to the German national team , have been excluded .	-4.6640
Grindel pointed out to Gündogan that , unlike Özil , he felt " reasonably treated by the DFB " after the World Cup affair , which began with photographs of the two with Erdogan .	-5.1476
At the same time , he announced his intention to face players in the future .	-3.7699
That someone says : If I win , I am German , if I lose , I am a migrant - that is not possible .	-3.3013
" I regret that he has such an impression , " Grindel said .	-5.3612
I have always said that we should have defended Mesut more .	-2.0248
But he does not see any basis for a return to the national team .	-4.7193
As a conclusion , an additional integration representative is to be appointed alongside the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic , who have family roots in Cameroon .	-9.7609
'If anyone without a migrant background has a clear influence on society and football and says : ' The issue is important , we have to deal with it ' , that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs , where integration has to work , ' said Grindel .	-6.8165
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup break and the Özil affair , he intends to run for the DFB again next year .	-6.9309
" I do my job and try to do it as well as I can , " said Grindel .	-3.0864

Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors	-3.9933

On higher pass roads ( Arlbergpass , Timmelsjoch , Biel Höhe , Brenner Pass , Gerlospass , Felbertauern , Grossglockner High Alpine Road ) the road conditions become winter .	-4.3614
On Monday , farmers are allowed to begin their annual Knicks	-6.7829
Schleswig-Holstein farmers are allowed to start the annual Knickpflege on Monday .	-4.8739
The " green ramparts " , unique in Germany , have shaped the landscape of the country with a low forest content for about 200 years .	-6.2859
The tree and stud shrubs , which are up to five metres wide , are " forest substitutes " and for many animals and plants the last refuge areas .	-5.8635
Knicks connect dispersed living spaces as corridors over which the exchange of organisms can still work , as the Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Association ( NABU ) in Schleswig-Holstein , Ingo Ludwichowski , said .	-5.2277
Knicks Are Living Fences	-0.9587
The Knicks were created on the basis of a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766 , who ruled Schleswig-Holstein .	-3.5889
The " living fences " were not only field limitation and cattle fence , they also supplied firewood and beams to farmers for their half-timbered houses .	-4.4261
His name " Knick " also dates from that time : through " knitting " the branches could develop the dense , interdependent boundaries .	-6.1215
Today , between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea , around 45 000 kilometres of the hedgerows extend and give the picture of a rich and varied structured landscape .	-6.4021
According to the NABU , some 7000 animal species are now using it as a replacement habitat .	-5.1992
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometer of Knick and breed up to 30 pairs of birds .	-5.0669
The Knick can only perform its ecologically important function if it is maintained in winter .	-5.1668
Otherwise , he withers into a thin series of trees which , in addition to biodiversity , also loses the wind protection effect , said Ludwichowski .	-7.2230
According to the Ministry of Agriculture , the Knickpflege can only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March .	-5.0843
After Tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia talks about on-site SItution .	-4.6663
In an interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) , the local Radica Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquake and tsunami :	-4.2706
Were you there yourself during the tsunami ?	-3.1371
No , I was at that time in Jakarta on the island of Java .	-2.4008
When the earthquakes were , my wife called me , she was in Palu .	-1.8229
When I learned about the tsunami , I immediately went back to Sulawesi .	-3.4858
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport at Palu was closed at that time .	-4.0189
What is the situation on the island now ?	-1.4814
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in .	-3.3431
When I arrived , I saw the houses on the coast , all completely destroyed .	-3.3954
Our office of " World Vision " has also been destroyed , but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people .	-5.5809
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now ?	-2.5955
Many are named on surrounding hills , where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake , and where they have no access to water and food .	-4.4491
Some are standing in front of their homes and there are still aftershocks .	-3.6766
Because many grocery stores and petrol stations are completely closed , people sometimes steal food and petrol .	-4.5167
The public service has been completely shut down and the national government is helping out .	-3.1942
A prison has also been destroyed , some of the prisoners are free and it is difficult to find them .	-4.5042
There are still many bodies around , many people have not yet been found and are missing .	-3.2894
How does communication and information flow on the island ?	-2.6996
At the moment we have mobile phone reception , but before that it did not work and we only got information from the radio .	-5.4790
Many people are still looking for their children , neighbours and other people from whom they do not know whether they live and where they are , because people were not at home during the earthquakes , but were on work , for example .	-5.5582
The tsunami warning system did not work properly .	-1.6677
Do you have any information about this ? of . . . . . . . . . . .	-4.6996
We do not know the reasons for this , but when the all-clear came , many thought ' OK , not a tsunami ' - and then it came .	-3.5792
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami , there has been misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they have hit the surrounding mountains .	-4.1751
Is an island like Sulawesi , located on the Pacific Fire Ring , not prepared for earthquakes ?	-2.9934
But , there are earthquakes every day , but that was the worst here .	-2.9292
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and train evacuations .	-6.9636
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed and the earthquake has hit a great many people .	-3.4502
VfB has decided to leave Aogo and Donis for a long time .	-7.1302
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time .	-4.1666
On Saturday Aogo got a muscle fiber break in the rear left thigh at 2 : 1 against Werder Bremen , the Bundesligist announced on Sunday .	-8.0389
In Donis , doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle rupture in the thigh .	-3.8107
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss matches after the following break .	-5.0177
VfB Stuttgart did not issue a forecast for the downtime .	-4.4148
A muscle loosening usually heals within six to eight weeks , a muscle fibre tear usually conceals a little faster .	-6.8073

It remained in the area of water surveillance station .	-3.5415
To help the animal , passers-by called the police and the fire brigade .	-2.7603
However , the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong .	-2.9852
In spite of the injury , she has been able to avoid the forces .	-5.3334

With a rescue boat , the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back to the land , where , after almost an hour , it was put into a transport chest by a fireman with a bold grip .	-6.5063
The duck injured on his chest was then taken to the LMU animal clinic to Oberschleißheim .	-4.4848

" I deliberately allowed myself time to process this , " says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden .	-3.7268
One medal was the goal , I was in top shape , but it just didn 't want to be .	-3.4017
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the precious metal that has been missing in the new season : " The goal can only be to return to a major event with the constitution , to win something .	-4.9989
At some point you have to strike .	-4.0499
The World Championship track in Östersund ( SWE ) is Eberhard : " I have already closed the track to my heart " , he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year .	-4.3927

With the season he was ranked second in Oslo ( NOR ) .	-4.7311
Brett Kavanaugh : Turbospeed FBI investigation	-2.2594
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interviews is very limited .	-3.8881
With an FBI turbo-speed investigation , Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the razor-thin majority for the disputed Judge ’ s Team Brett Kavanaugh on charges of coercion .	-7.2699
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that took place more than 30 years ago .	-4.0134
The recent turn in the drama of Kavanaugh 's appeal accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday .	-4.3866
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor , Christine Blasey Ford , during which the jurist unleashed a furious tirade against opposition Democrats , the Senate Judiciary Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the US Supreme Court archconservative judge .	-5.3316
The Republicans ’ majority seemed certain when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared , contrary to his initial announcement , that he would agree , but demanded an FBI inquiry .	-3.6249
After tumultuous scenes , his party friends agreed .	-2.8036
President Trump , who described Thursday 's severe reproaches as ' appeasement ' , initially refrained from further attacks on women and , on the contrary , spoke of ' happiness in misfortune ' .	-6.1083
In this way , last doubts could be dispelled , he said .	-3.1502
Later , in an election rally , Trump grabbed the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh : “ They are trying to block and destroy . ”	-4.4256
Trump orders FBI investigation in Kavanaugh	-3.0918
The White House has also severely limited investigators ’ powers .	-3.1306
One will investigate the well-known accusations of two women in a targeted manner , but not more , a government representative told the Wall Street Journal : ' They do not go on a fishing trip ' .	-7.1362
According to the New York Times , only four witnesses are to be heard .	-1.7296

FC Schalke 04 after winning against Mainz : The fear felt .	-3.7604
Trainer Domenico Inglesa and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz .	-3.4181
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory .	-3.5479
Nevertheless , the factor of time played a role against Mainz .	-3.0723
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches .	-3.6081
This was no different in the home match against Mainz 05 .	-2.6031
" I saw every ball in it .	-1.6883
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room , " said the Schalke 04 and Atmete Sports Board .	-3.6837
After all , the royal blue had managed to complete the 1 : 0 strike against the Rhine hessen over time and thus the first victory in the season .	-11.1989
Things could have been different .	-3.8689
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of chief coach Domenico Inglesco , Tedesco had given his assurance : " In sum , the first half was good , both playfully and by pressing , " apparently more and more of the head played a role with the increasing duration of the game .	-9.6357
Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Do. .	-9.2111
" The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me , " he said : " If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench , I can understand it " .	-4.6608
The guys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore withdrew .	-5.6174
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz .	-2.8251
To save the first three counters of the season .	-1.6031
" We all liked a huge stone from our hearts , " said Schöpf , who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit : " I am actually the worst headball player in the team . "	-7.3185
But in the end , only victory counts .	-2.2865
The relief was felt throughout the arena , including , of course , at Tedesco .	-3.7487
" We wanted to make a powerful start in the initial phase and make a fireworks display out of it , " said Schalke 's chief coach .	-5.5404
The victory was important .	-1.3061
Finally we can enjoy a few hours .	-3.1213
I am very , very happy for the team and the fans .	-1.3972
We have played intelligently , calmly and courageously , so we have to go on games for over 90 minutes .	-4.8021
Perhaps the greatest flaw of the afternoon : King ’ s blue missed it , rather than worrying for clearer circumstances .	-5.9754
The possibilities for this were finally there , for example , through the strong yevhen konpplyanka , who twice met 59 / 72 or Amine Harit 62 .	-6.1037
" Then it would not have become a victory of quotation , " said Inglese : " You have already felt the fear a bit " .	-5.7590
I am therefore pleased that we have won .	-1.8933
He was not the only shawker .	-3.4446
Fischbachau : Smoking column in the Leichtal valley visible 2 km .	-4.1169
The smoke could not be overlooked .	-2.0038
From about two kilometres away , a hiker observed a fire in the Leichtal Valley at around 1.30 p.m. on Sunday .	-6.0426
Now the police are investigating .	-1.6751
Fischbachau - The reason for this was soon discovered by the police and fire brigade : an unknown person had lit up rubbish on two square metres of the Gwendner mountain .	-6.3902
According to the police , he seemed to have been monitoring the fire for a long time , but left the glut unattended .	-4.8845
This is close to the forest .	-2.9922
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy with pulling apart and unloading .	-4.2757
The police are now investigating for arson .	-2.0125
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafalani discusses integration : A discussion on equal terms .	-3.6255
In front of them is the author , Professor Aladin El-Mafalani .	-3.5231
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild .	-3.3025
" I have made it my task to get interesting people to Greven for many years now " , explains the founder and chairman of the " Reckenfelder Treffen " - the association that cooperates with the " Cultural Policy " alliance in organizing the evening .	-6.8319
El-Mafalani rises very loosely in the reading , describes the writing process of the book , talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way .	-5.6569
With a lot of gestures , tangible figures and one or other joke , he brings the audience closer to one of the most controversial themes : migration and integration .	-5.3053
Why are conflicts emerging despite successful integration ?	-2.9423
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question .	-3.1313
German society sits at one table , the first-generation migrants at the cat ’ s table .	-7.9909
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table .	-2.3424
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany , they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate .	-3.7563
That leads to conflict .	-1.6281
The decisive factor , therefore , is not whether one is politically on the right or on the left , but rather : ' Am I for or against an open society ? ' , he emphasises .	-5.2348
At first behave rather , then the discussion round starts more and more actively .	-7.3908
And there is a need for speaking .	-2.7207
An Afghan refugee tells from his perspective , two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students .	-4.1990
El-Mafaalani is on the table , not on stage , a symbol of the debate : it is on an equal footing .	-6.0988
The sociology professor does not rule out his opinion , stresses that he speaks of average , not individual destinies .	-4.9113
He is pleased that there is interest in this issue , because ' only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions ' , says El-Mafaalani .	-4.8426
During the signing hour he also listened to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer , where prepared Kurdish specialities were discussed intensively .	-5.9797

The ambitious Bonner won at the Göttingen BG at 86 : 79 ( 49 : 47 ) .	-5.1154
Alba Berlin is the season ’ s first table-leader after the 112 : 55 Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena .	-5.1095

Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new building area Landsho-Süd on the free market .	-5.1818
The mayor , Roland Frick , informs . , , , and .	-4.7678
In addition , the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality is completed at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous single-country model .	-7.3995
More than 100 applications have been received , according to Frick .	-2.9794
" At the moment the documents are checked " , with regard to the application criteria , completeness and correctness .	-4.0362
According to the mayor of Plieningen , the aim was to have prepared the candidate ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council .	-5.9146
After that , the award could take place .	-3.6019
In total , 50 plots of land for single and double houses are being created in the south of Landshom , as well as four areas for multi-family houses with an estimated eight units each .	-6.7013
The development is now almost complete and the roads and roads are to be paved in the near future .	-5.6070
One single plot as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to one private person , the rest of the municipality Pliening .	-5.5652
It sells the majority on the free market , 20 plots in a socially acceptable model .	-3.7636
According to Frick , the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing .	-4.7298
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments funded by the State of Bavaria .	-5.0517
Place for 200 people	-1.3838
It is widely estimated that the area of the new rural south housing area is created for about 200 people .	-5.7598

Three crèches , three crèches and three crèches as well as a multipurpose room will be .	-4.9263
The opening is scheduled for September 2019 , at the start of the next kindergarten year .	-3.5435
So Schalkes ’ s Naldo “ Great Sport ” also succeeds in the Bank .	-5.9647
Not in the start elf for the third time in a row : nevertheless , Naldo thanks the shawlke trainer Domenico Ingleco .	-7.1933
After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Start11 but on the replacement bench , the understanding would have been great for many people if the nearly two meter Brazilian had really spoken the frustration of his soul .	-8.0533
But when the shawkers gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1 : 0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and thanked the chief coach Domenico Tedesco to all his professionals , the 36 year-old , who everyone , for the sake of simplicity , called Naldo , turned up and said : ' We have to thank , trainer ! '	-7.9172
" That was very emotional , it was great sport , " said Tedesco later about the reaction of his vice captain , who , despite his renewed reservation , did not have any resentment .	-6.8045
Probolich knows Naldo , who was the best shawl in the last season , that he has not really got on the sidetrack with his coach - but has a break for good reasons .	-8.1735
One reason called " load control " .	-2.3934
It was not easy to tell him that .	-2.0237
" It was not easy to tell him this , I tell you quite honestly , " Tedesco reported when he said Naldo that he was not in the start eleven .	-5.8176
He is an important player , he is an important person .	-2.0839
But it is always about the matter , it is about the association " , Tedesco founded the step .	-5.2203
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes .	-1.7263
He is 36 years old .	-0.7029
It is important that everyone is able to buy now .	-4.4983
And that we all keep in the boat , " Tedesco explained the rotation that last caught Naldo .	-4.8705
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age : by also proving to be a model team player on the bank .	-4.9486
In August , the mood in Austria ’ s industry continued to accelerate its decline relative to the eurozone .	-4.5146
The Purchasing Manager Index ( PMI ) was 46.7 points on a 37-month low .	-2.7356
Despite this , Austria has the third best atmosphere behind Ireland and the Netherlands , according to the Markit Institute on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies .	-5.8229
Unlike in Austria , the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points , but the index is still the 13th month in a row below the 50 meter mark indicating growth .	-5.5118
Only Ireland 's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points .	-3.2354
At the bottom were the Greeks ( 42.1 points ) .	-3.2218
The mood barometer fell in Germany , France , and Spain , but more slowly than in previous months .	-3.2253
In Spain , the index reached its highest level since March , at 44.0 points .	-7.9590
" The slight slowdown may mean that the worst is over , " said Markit economist Rob Dobson .	-3.7591
But industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter at least .	-9.5486
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight : exports in the eurozone fell as fast as they did in November 2011 .	-3.9804
For this reason , the companies dropped jobs for the seventh consecutive month .	-5.1716
In China , too , industrial production fell more sharply in August than was initially assumed .	-3.7820
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points .	-1.8715
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points .	-1.5922
The Purchasing Manager Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies .	-3.7625
Among other things , it highlights developments in sales , employment , camps and prices .	-4.2148
