Munich 1856: Four tickets that change your view of the city.
An irritation where young people are to meet today.
A Gruftkapelle, where the tunnel is now buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It is nervt if maps are not current.
Everyone knows this, who had to get excited about it, because the auto Navi instead of a bypass a green meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of Geoportals as Bavaria ’ s state government, are anything but topical - but very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the nineteenth century in the Munich area of crime.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork I do not recognize as such.
In the large overview map were prepared for cities and municipalities more detailed maps, so-called leaflets.
This was the result of the Bavarian survey between 1810 and 1864 and was the first survey of Bayerns.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied land and gave a topographic picture of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops, with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, were finally withdrawn: today ’ s neighbors, the idea of a Bayern-Karte nationwide.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographische Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian survey.
The Munich Urpositionsblatt dates back to 1856 and is found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek website.
Compared to early / Today, the capital of the country is the most impressive example.
The city has grown in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is subsendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, when Munich district was founded.
Today, Untersendling is located in the heart of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705. the state of. the state the state of the state.
Where the Westpark is today, there is nothing to be seen as fields - at first glance: a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwriting numbered pieces of the so-called "urine" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels are no longer farmers there, but small gardeners in the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the Oktoberfest site, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Official Journal of the Urpositionsblatt, the district of Au-Haidhausen reads not only the street name "am Gasteig" or "Anhöhe" on the lies "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt ".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with madness.
In 1858 / 59 the Munich-Kreis-Irrenanstalt was founded on the Auer Lüften.
In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended the example of the anchor of the so-called irritation.
In addition, he has prohibited personnel from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been busy with the Anstalt exhibition.
For 280 patients was first place, then 500 seats were expanded later.
At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circle nostalgia in Haar 1905.
Since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrists, has been.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Munich Salesianum.
The Orden acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities.
Westlich is the football ground of the TSV München Ost, east of the homes of the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural style, rebuilding the origins of the rise that was destroyed during World War II in bombings.
The Marienplatz was named "Haupt Platz" in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought the Second World War to the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs in December 1944 left many holes in the city centre.
A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a mine chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days work and take place on April 5, 2017 of the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn line.
With the slider, the old Munich Card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and the Loch am Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colour has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and the racist attacks of the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls for African-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to be cautious when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and here it is stated in the opinion of the group.
A recent law by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, which have disproportionately targeted minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
"You have infringements of civil rights that happen to people.
They are recruited because of their skin colour, they are beaten up or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol in the journey and was detained by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of a crime.
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the General Prosecutor's Office of Missouri, which shows that black drivers are more likely to be recruited in the state than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees what could happen in Missouri", said Chapel.
"People must be prepared to bring the deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassverbrechens-Berichtsprogramm des FBI, which classifies the state as regards the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the laws of immigration were passed, local law enforcement agencies committed to arresting people for immigrant offences, which, in the opinion of ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary.
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU members of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have given a picture on the ground.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverbands met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members.
Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his operation, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses five holiday guests.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.,,,,.,,,,,,,,,,
On the table of the holiday guests is exclusively regional.
Since he is also a BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaunprojekt as "elementar important".
I cannot be profitable in such steep areas.
The green area for a lot of work needs to be worked on with the engine sense.
"We are fighting with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not carry out a bio plant.
For mayors Thomas Schneider was clear: "The Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunprojekts and is pleased with the Leader-Förderung".
At the expense of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be extended even further.
"The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they continue to operate", stressed the mayor.
Farmers are often criticized for supporting them.
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced over the Weidezaunförderung.
The open area is 40 hectares, which must not be forged until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was promoted through Leader, a district contributed the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, farmers love EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "Your job makes a good job, without farmers and rural women it is not".
Also for Peter Weiß stood firm: "Here are best food produced".
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state promotion of female fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The precondition is the existence of a sponsorship program called by the LPR.
In addition, the area of fences must not be sustainable (0.35%) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the fisherman's bacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build just 16 kilometres of fence is under.
The area of disclosure is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now Trump ’ s White House is facing the statue of liberty.
The safest sign of a regime change is to start attacking the statues.
The Americans, like any other, therefore, appreciate the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president to reduce legal immigration with regard to freedom statue.
To remain fair, Miller did not use the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty-beekeepers would have lied if he had done so.
But he took on their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it was added as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base.
As a Miller Acosta: "I don't want to go into a complete story here, but the statue of freedom is a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem that you refer to later was added and not part of the original statue is ".
Miller is right, but, as he himself said, it is not really about history.
It is about contemporary resonance to the revealing words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your mills, your poor, / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the elusive waste of your rich coasts".
There was never a time when the "elende waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about America's importance.
Lazarus - and their friends who campaigned to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they had taken a highly political action.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic image.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: mother of exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just like Lazarus, the meaning of the statue changed, people wanted to switch back from the right wing for a long time.
The great shrine as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the statue of liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives who rebuilt the American flame into the world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.
The torch should not learn the way in the United States. '
Ziemlich ungewöhnlich ist Limbaugh hier auf etwas gestoßen.
The importance of the statue is, at all, a question of the position of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elusive but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships.
It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and will they have to listen.
And that is not, of course, the prospect that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.
Their torch should not learn the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team.
Eilidh Doyle reminds himself of a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team.
The UK ’ s performance director, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team in the World Cup of Conflict.
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that "in Scotland something special develops" and the UK's lightweight athletic needs to learn something from it.,,,,.,,,,,,
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it out," said Black.
"I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. '
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain speech was incredibly ", says Black.
"A number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that the Eilidh was of course a great one.
The Commonwealth Silver medal winners, who won their fifth World Championships at the 400-m hurdles, are saying that it is unbelievable that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, reached in 1983 and 2015.
The mediocre runner Muir is on this road and has established two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games after a great season.
Doyle recalls her first World Championships, when the only Scot in the team Lee McConnell was.
The team apitänin says that they are "immensely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also in the medals and in the finals.
"The special feature of Team-Kapitänin is that she was elected by the other members of the team so that it was so great honor anyway, but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me, it makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
As regards my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think they went well.
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a World Cup home.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be so a great atmosphere out there. "
Blocking critics about Facebook: Do not worry about a public office if you can ’ t stand in the way of electorates.
The father of our country knew something worse off press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He sent criticism, certainly.
But he has not silenced his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said: 'Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stubborn, we will be guided like sheep to slaughter'.
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union withdrew it from the beginning of this week.
The bar of the governor left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?".
"It is only Facebook", said many people.
But it is important.
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hit head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playing his haarless head to chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is officially referred to as being officially paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hated people who are swimming online.
The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserfilled, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment area of the message "The Post".
"I do not appreciate this idea, even if a number of people speak on the same subject, they are more likely to be disregarded than a so-called collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected."
What the staff of the governor called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call other "intercession".
The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in previous times if the same had been done that staff were sent to collect newspapers with critical editorials and to arrest or silence demonstrators.
But that is precisely what is happening in digital terms.
Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being squandered by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US District judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when she appointed a constituent of her facebook page.
And in Kentucky received Governor Matt Bevin (R) also a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be so difficult.
At the time Washington had the time of affordable portos having a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters suggested his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
People who used Pseudonyme like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that overwhelmed his position on the treaty of Amity, trade, and shipping with Britain, his office, according to the historical documents collected by George Washington Project Online Papers.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse form the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club Club.
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for the next three days at home, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Ireland, which took place last year on the Archerfield links to the final round before he lost Paul Eales, is connected with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the association founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.,,,.,,,,,,, and.,,,,,
"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he reached this event his fame," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great condition.
Jerry has done a great job as he established this place.
He is an eager champion of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great storefront for this course. "
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels especially at", said the player in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open because it won in the year after I had won it from the program.
Back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate. "
Gary Orr, who, after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returned to the European Senior Tour, returns to the ground.
This event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more if you play home", said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf.
I am glad about how it has gone. '
With the trio on the field, former Masters Sieger Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance belong to the six Scots in the field, the other are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer dead by passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
As a result, scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking," said Master Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer cases per year in Germany because of passive smoking.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Household connections are very complex.
The construction works in the Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are reasonably in the time", the manager of the Bauhofs Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as there is much hidden in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Transport, which is constantly hampering the construction work, is a major problem for the construction of the Stumpp company.
"The ignorance of car drivers in front of red lights and locks is already enormous", says Heinze.
The street is closed and only the bus lines are entitled to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite nice.
But fortunately we were told by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water ", Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei uses dinner cooks, she does not use Herd.
It even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife normally defines a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour the recommended node will be washed with iron, unwashed hands and disappeared.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she doesn't have furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example dresses with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
An egg in a dachless space serves as a latrine.
When the youngest of the four wives of her husband were not assigned to her fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, it can be too late to work dangerously: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around after 17 o'clock in the village," she says.
It is a rare glimpse of the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was admitted to Indonesia after a controversial referendum in 1969, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public handing over to the occupying forces.
An existing movement stemming from the independence of the Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region, excluding foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea being the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as derived as it is from the journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morgendliche 5-hour car ride with the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs, converted by rosé into various yellow brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, revered Mee Pago Papuans named Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We were not accustomed to wearing these clothes," Degei says and hints at their lively, handwoven turban, their dark shirt and their bright rock.
"Early we had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold land.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a high-land province of New Jersey, with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has cut $3.1 billion in gold and copper value.
Moreover, Papua has more than $78 billion worth of timber resources.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains its presence.
An investigation in 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport had paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $20 million, including up to $150,000 in a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gangs and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military.
Mass killings in Papuas tribal ochland in the 1970 ’ s were committed to genocide in accordance with the Asia-Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We shall establish everything" means in a report by the Erzdiözese Brisbane from 2016, in which reports on atrocities in the previous year are included, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because every week incidents happen", says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased, as Papua resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is too 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung-Kantinen sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetables served with sauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to work.
"It has the native Papua - the Mama [women] of Papua - cost their market."
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 campaign to address the inequalities and injuries in Papua during his election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel rosy.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jokowi, with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored", says You.
Indeed, Paniai suffered only two months after Jokowi inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children out there and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enarotali, as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through darkness.
The shocked children told them that they should turn their headlights on.
One of the soldiers took Anstoß back to their tone and later came back with four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk, hunted and swallowed the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then a soldier fired in the group of children.
A child who was 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission set fire and escalated things next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They roamed the Waita-Dance - in the circle and a bird song imitating - by Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm.
Some demonstrators began to inject stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldier was sent a command over an internal radio: "If the masses were more than three times resistance, they seemed dead," it says in an official document of TIME, which was not released by the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto-Viertels of Enarotali, saw the threatening threat and called for calm and the crowd to return home.
No one was listening to the mood.
"When I turned me, I suddenly was shot in my left hand hand wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, his cousin, the witness of the shooting.
"I ran to him and studied his body to be sure that he was it", said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in dire mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I bought him".
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers wanted to secure their station only "because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It is about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings came only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks ago Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swear to address the historical ills in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred long ago.
Some were in the 1990's and early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements, but there are processes that need to be carried out ', he said.
Then, Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to Jakarta on 5 June with TIME and said he did not have plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, 'everything is regulated by law', he said.
In 1999, Wiranto, accused the UN of 'crimes against humanity', which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody Independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of Paniai victims received such claims with grim disbelief.
"I was interviewed in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I am tired."
He says that he still lives in fear for years to come.
"I am afraid" he says.
"I am afraid to be arrested by the military, fear of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military sought me," he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot in Paniais neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital, a person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man who was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drunk when he died in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Regular villagers protested before the company ’ s location office.
The police said that the villagers stole stones on officers who responded by firing hot shots.
But locals say that mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the crowd and killed.
"We were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge", says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who was living near the hospital and witness how the injured were delivered quickly, so the TIME.
"I hid two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to account and withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the area.
Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many open-air pope movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested in recent years and arbitrarily detained in custody, under the pretext of 'securing national sovereignty'.
Some never appear again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as distant.
The people here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and bubble vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process the four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport have been increasing.
The few jobs that exist in the region are usually better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua seldom have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because here there are no jobs or money", says John Gobai, the chairman of the board of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on media coverage remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, even though they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Asia ’ s Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Mangelnde press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshallin Islands and the Salomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the 'various and widespread violations' in Papua, including the Paniai Foundry.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
The Speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group ’ s allegations and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited on 4 May, locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also attended the meeting, but would like to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another 2019 presidential election, but the Papua said that they will probably not vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai nuts," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from the constant threat of a predatory military, are living in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he must pay back.
"You do not need any money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the Paniai victims' families carried out a last symbolic act of consolation: the suffering of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed", says Yacobus with blessed head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the Torch'Wolkenkratzer from Dubai for the second time.
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents from 337 meters high, 79-storey buildings.
It is the second fire in only two years by the high-rise house, which is due to the torch tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We have sworn and we have stood up at the fire alarm and the horrors of the people.
We burned the staircase under, and it lasted about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor down, "told a resident who called his name as George angab, Reuters.
Dubais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 local time (00.00 clock GMT) caused the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident can be used for the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the majority of the damage suffered by the clothing, exterior clothing for decoration or isolation came.
In the United Kingdom, the police said they believe that the system of plates to isolate and garment at the London Grenfell tower in June contributed to the rapid spread of a fire, where around 80 people died.
No Davis-Cup-Reform: Continue Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, for this sport revolutionary proposal, Davis-Cup-Einzel was supported only by two winning bets, thin not by the required two-thirds majority.
Although it is often very long, it is precisely for that reason that highly esteemed five-atz-classics remain in the traditional bid.
63.54% of the member states voted in favour of the reform, the goal of the ITF president, David Haggerty, was therefore scarcely missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our membership delegations did not adopt the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, "said Haggerty.
We will continue to work to improve the evaluation.
Not until the vote was taken after many contradictions before the proposal was made to put the final on a neutral spot.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right in the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements for training places etc will be facilitated and players will have to complete the official Media ermine before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings banned items to the plane, a survey finds out.
A survey conducted by air passengers showed that more than 20% deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items were passed to US Transportation Security Administration control points, including at least 6%, the aircraft was dispatched while they accidentally hired knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1% claimed they had been late discovered that they were mistaken with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey carried out by more than 1,000 people - by a Jet-Charterservice, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that younger travelers are more abusing the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that was banned by TSA, 19.7% was compared to less than 15%, the X generation members.
The most common items that were sent to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% gave, knowingly, items worn with blades through security control, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately banned drugs..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The company said that it asked travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods would have brought airport security and how many intentionally done it.
It is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear smuggling goods - knowingly or unwittingly - by the safety of those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of what liquids they may take or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while people thought TSA could view books as smuggling ware.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order Order Order Order.
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
In doing so, he has hitherto suggested that part of the customer has withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphal figures on revenue increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has, for the first time, a different, less glance number: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just begins.
Now, Musk admits that a total of 518.000 pre-orders have been withdrawn again.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the United Kingdom £1000) "Reservation Payment" completely back.
Currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders for the problem could not be believed by the Tesla boss.
His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 - all models should be combined - 500,000, 2020 a million.
Demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today can expect to be delivered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to maximize its nagelnew, never tested production lines without any major disruption with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there is too much delay, the impossibility of making reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
For then, the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running out of the box.
EPA boss Pruitt withdraws from the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions because of the delay in executing the rules.
A day after having been squandered by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog caused air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency responds to the needs of state environmental authorities in relation to responsiveness more quickly than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been raised against his previous post in a federal court.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations before his appointment by President Donald Trump ’ s Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma.
Ever since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone to block regulation or delay the chemical industry and industry resisting fossil fuels.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn at Ozonstandards is simply a willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of new standards.
"Under previous administrations, EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," Pruitt said, which EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation by legal proceedings and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that gives us serious'.
Nevertheless, the EPA's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use its' power to delay and make all the other legally available powers' to ensure that the rules are based on a sound policy and the best available information '.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure was not put to the vote in the Senate.
The New Yorker Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that had sue EPA this week, said that the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.
"The reversal of EPA - after our complaints - is an important asset for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog in their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and District of Columbia.
Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power stations, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources respond to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups, and every year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered over Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe", said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pollute the environment and to attack their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16th, at 4.30 pm is invited to a serenade.
Whether it is an idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and supporters of Tumling their concerns.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique dörfliches Kleinod".
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch urkundlich: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen samt of the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
The wording of the document was in the church of Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, also a ruling court, which belonged to the church or the patron law and not vice versa.
So people lived there too.
As shown in the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the town image of Tumlingen, the "Berg" of the third, the predominant settlers of the village.
Old maps from the time around the year 1600 underpin these historical realities.
The patronage law arose from the early medieval own church law.
A Lord who built a church and continued to occupy a parish was able to continue to occupy this church and inherit it it.
The right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower.
The largest of the two crushed at Christmas 1673.
The newly acclaimed Glocke was then crowned for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered in 1942 in World War II.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were insulated and the bells stolen.
The roof was undicht.
In 1796, French troops relocated near the church.
They brake the chancellor and church chairs and use them as firewood.
Overrests of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
In 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing boars.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Church of Hilarius broke off.
Lediglich den Kirchturm ließ man stehen.
In the New Year ’ s Eve 1834, a storm plunged the Kirchturm and half crashed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was broken.
Only the Turmzwerg still existing today remained a witness of the 750 years old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cultivate the "Schaffigen Rentnern" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius system.
As organizer, the friends and promoters of Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.
This article is about the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and about contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Urban Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Decree is from 15.30.
The Serenade has been transformed into a graveyard.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers challenge the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and promoters of Tumling feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade-Organisator Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to check approval of windmills.
"Boisheim does not see any legal precondition for construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It is illegal.
The association argues that, at the time of the approval of the Boisheimer Nette on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved, as there is only a quarter of the city ’ s border with Schwalmtal, a wind power center zone exists.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.
Derlei zones are intended to prevent a "failure" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had approved a few days earlier by changing the area use plan a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but the district government in Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the approved certificate is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn", said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim wehrt sich".
Current state of affairs: The city council decided again before the summer recess to the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; permission of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "In this respect, the granting of permission for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been entered in the circle of four last week," explained a speaker.
The circle takes the opportunity to review the matter again.
However, it is not likely that the procedure will be stopped.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle did not want to express itself on Thursday in terms of the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim wehrt sich".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build a surface area on the Boisheimer Nette at the construction of four 200 meters high windmills.
Last year, the company involved in the city of Viersen had already entered into contract with the owner of about 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power needs of around 11 400 households can be met - this is roughly equivalent to a fifth of the power needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersens Stadtrat gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor cranes together: Ms dies in terrible accident.
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman has been fatally injured.
Two more people were easily injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police data, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich accompanied her car in the context of the accompanying journey with her 53-year-old mother as a companion, L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and Dealers plan "home shoots" -weekend weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in downtown September.
The Gewerbeverein and Stadtverwaltung want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to relax the inhabitants of the shopping mall in the city centre.
As the Chairman of the Commercial Association, Christian König, announced, the "home shoots" weekend is intended to raise customers' awareness of what offers the city has its own outside of the usual supermarket goods.
It is therefore a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre should invite you to "Mitternachts-Shoppen".
In doing so, the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region.
In preparation are advertising spots in radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the weekend action, so Christian King.
Stadtverwaltung und Gewerbeverein kooperieren dabei mit der Industrie- und Handelskammer.
In this way, the business association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "Aktiv-Tag" to the Brunnenfest samt sold soffenem Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to move to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and waiver on parking fees are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
However, many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
At the end all of this would have to contribute to the city centre - right up to landlords, businesses throughout the city and clubs.
It gelte, with a network of lethargy to overcome, which had partly spread, had said king in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Centers in Mühlhausen shared that the third "home show" day, for the first time five Thüringer cities participate.
Apart from Bad Langensalza, this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should highlight "the appreciation of local trade and its importance for the common good of our cities", so strike.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can be directly influenced by his buying behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people have been injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine others have been injured, some of them hard.
According to the fire brigade on Wednesday (local time) an injured in a critical state.
A man died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A missing person was later born.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a matter of misfortune, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday, only a few people in the Minnehaha Academy buildings were held.
Trump, after leaked transcripts of telephone calls, called Mexico under pressure for the payment of the border wall.
Transkripte of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called for a telephone call with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President accused him because he had publicly denounced the wall, according to reports he said: 'You cannot tell the press.'
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US, and gay Mexico to pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US would take over refugees who emigrated to Australia "ridiculously", "mies" and "stupid" and that the existence on the trade that was conveyed by the Obama administration would look like a "depp" after proposing a ban on resettlement to refugees in the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr Turnbull, "that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford-Massaker: Activists lead racist Lynchakt as a call for justice again.
A 1948- Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in the rural monroe, Georgia, and rumped onto the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver, the bridge could reach, a group of white men came out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the Mobs - a middle-aged man in a needle strike - took a long train on his cigar and looked after by the windshield.
Drinks float the occupants in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" brilled the man.
"Hol him out of the car!"
Schreie torn the silence when a young black man was torn apart by the front-passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, played on July 22, was only a portrait.
But if a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all in the audience will be very real sigh from.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night, in the two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - from Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
Nobody has ever been accused of murder.
"It is really incomprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are", said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in organizing the post.
"It is a jewelry on a story, but it is a burden for our souls".
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a life long civil rights activist.
It serves as a dramatic call for action, and it is an annual reminder of the monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want to end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A medical court places a beggar over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchens on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI records received by NBC News, more than 50 men were suspected of monroe and the surrounding counties in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch's actions has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom reported a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had sworn with Malcoms Mrs. Dorothy and that the baby she did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved from prison and moved closer to Moore's Ford Bridge, Lynchmob moved the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes this from a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murder, evidences and obscured the identity of witnesses."
Brooks worded it even more concise.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"You were killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, then you will happen here. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual rendering of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.
Their presentation is vivid, seizing, and is based in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It is difficult to watch, and even more difficult to watch, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We do not want to talk about the Lynchen because we will then be faced with its severity in all of us," she said.
"But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I've done".
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and loudly, as Greene had a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not so", said Marbaugh.
"But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, the Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester play their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, the hester and afflicts him, angry that he has sworn with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappearing of my property!"
Rascona awakes the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks into laughter.
Greene laughs.
"What?", asked Rascona.
It is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still kichernd.
"I simply do not think that white people at the time" --- he said. "
"But", one of the other black performers celebrated.
"You only have to hit the hard" R. ".
And that is precisely because the energy moves in the room, a feeling of comradeship replaces unease.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he strongly says it.
Nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There are horrors, shots and then silence.
A woman suffering from a sadness stands above the bodies of the actor and performs Billie Holidays mourning eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks with every second word.

I prefer a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer.
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where?
Lots: Usually in Steinfurt in the Furniture Exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have already worked in the open Ganztag at school.
How do you experience it?
Much: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late volunteer.
How does this happen?
Lots: I made Abitur.
And then a Bauingenieur study, let us say, successfully aborted.
I recognized for me that it is for me the wrong thing and I want to do something else with people.
And then I asked myself what do you do.
Mach a social year, because there is a glimpse, since you can see how it is on the ground, in the focal point perhaps, is really.
And was it so?
Lots: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the winter semester in the social.
I will study dual, probably in the youth office Herne a social worker training and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different sites during the volunteer service?
Lots: Yes, it is very variable.
It is always important where you make your FSJ.
It is possible to go from old age to youth work - in all kinds of facets of social work.
I was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me this was exactly the right thing to do.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike construction engineers?
crowd: Na clear, this is not about calculating statics.
People have always been thinking of others who have a very different history.
Whether a refugee, a youth who has been taken out of the family, must always be addressed individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no contact?
Lots: I am not the type.
It is an area where there is a great deal.
Much love, much kindness.
There are also negative moments, but so life is life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive business.
The British Educational Group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate dividend by 72%, as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company.
The job cuts, the Director-General John Fallon mostly came to an end in 2018 and early 2019, additionally to his previous restructuring, which had already lost 4,000 posts.
Pearson announced another £300 million ($394 million) in May in a third cost-cutting program to revive a business that was hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its participation in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann's partner last month, said that the outlook for the fiscal year remains unchanged, having achieved a growth of 1% to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack by Kabul: Nato Soldat killed suicide bombing.
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoi in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a soldier of Nato and violating several others, telling officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a declaration by Nato.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
In an opinion of Nato, it is said that the explosion took place on Thursday evening, when a joint patrol was attacked with the Afghan army by an improvised spokesman. '
The statement states that all injuries are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since the US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power.
Violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump weighs down the number of US troops, the military, and the police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses the delay of the smoothing rule after complaints.
The US Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay a regulation of Obama ’ s government, requiring states to contain smog emissions, a day after 15 states sue the Agency for the Progress.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to press ahead with the so-called 'ozone rules 2015' and said that it will show the Agency's commitment to work with states.
"We believe in the dialogue and that we respond to our state partners," said EPA CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the intention of the EPA to define the ozone rules - in which part of the country's emissions should be measured in order to establish where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year to October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to revive a broad range of environmental issues that former President Barack Obama has imposed as part of a broader agenda that Trump is supposed to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature groups that are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The website of the EPA says that breathing air containing ozone contains' reducing lung function and strengthening respiratory symptoms', such as asthma.
Community area
At the end, the decision was clear: in two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzel decides to set up a Community space in the future senior residence.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the property is signed, the mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
Although it will take up to now the area in the municipal council, which has so far been part of the parish, there is now no plan for the project to be stamped by a private investor.
There is a discussion on a Community area.
One of the two investors who are still on board has offered to come to the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council pretend that such a common space is not just a meeting place for the inhabitants of the seniorenfair housing, but an open community.
As an example, the word "knickcafé" made the round.
The decision to allocate funds to the current budget has already been decided last autumn by means of funding.
Construction is located in the rehabilitation area.
The creation of a Community space would be reported to the Tjaden, with 60% of 30% eligible.
The proposal for a decision to signal to the investor that, in this respect, he does not want to throw a stiff between the legs, the observation that both sattel- and what is leaning towards the environment - and Pultdach - would be reduced and the construction of economic power - would be possible.
Not only does Wilfried Sohmer think that this addition is necessary.
If 's help: unanimity will happen.
It is not as simple as the Community area.
Daniela's reputation refers to the many buildings with which we are not making such progress, for which we are now opposed to the Community area from the window, she says: 'I am struggling with it'.
Yvonne Staiger is very much in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against local participation.
It provides for a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant, but rather is a real counter-value that is marketable in the case of doubt.
Staigers ’ request to split the resolution accordingly finds three supporters.
There are two votes against in the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: 'If we take the decision, we are taking a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure'.
Collision with Auto: Radler is on the street gendudert.

In the Harz of Stern to Hike
In the Harz, the first "Star Path" should be created.
This is the association of Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "Star Path" meets the information needs of many Harzbesucher.
He combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up and inform about stars and constellations along the planned route.
In a first phase up to 2018 the association plans "well attainable installations at five to six places" in Oberharz.
Infra cheese St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the table should be supplemented by Internet.
For this reason, a good mobile phone reception plays a role in choosing the location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the USS Enterprise-D was extended by train.
"The observer learns a lot of worth of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars", explained the association.
Moreover, they learned why stars would have different colors, or why a star would have brightened more than another, even though it was far further away.
It will also mediate in which star image is a selected star and when it is best to see.
Since 2014, the association has been operating in the mountain towns of St. Andreasberg, the highest observatory in Northern Germany.
The location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are clearly visible with a mere eye.
In the Uni-Stadt there has been something similar to the planned star advertising - the Planetarium Göttingen Planetarium since 2003.
Beginning in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetenweg with its steels up to the Hainberg and the Sternwarte - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steels with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the end point - are exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth is shrinking so to a ball of 6.5 millimeters diameter, while the exact 75 meters distant Sun measures 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres.
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the world.
The march to the next fixed star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show down.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are in a collision course, should stand to stag the most exciting Boxkampf in the near future under £147, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate spaces in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, up to Garcia, the unrivalled World Boxing Council lightweight champion, the Flur went down to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federgewicht-Champion.

I wish you good luck. '
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 19 pm on ESPN.
As the pair for photos posited, Lomachenko-Manager Egis climatic noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former feather weight", reminded Garcia.
"I am up for bronze [on 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I am small for 140.
I would like to come down to light weight.
And he must move on to lightweight [135 pounds], and then we fight.
That is what fans demand.
Let us give them that. '
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight".
Climate wondered if it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-Pfund-Debüt this year to agree a date in the next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) of the interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight battles in the forum on 23 September.
"This fight could take place in pay per-view mode because all fans asked him", said Garcia and expressed himself openly later to fight from the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said that he valued Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and he may be taking part in his samba fight.
But Lomachenko thought in the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think the tri-fight champion from Riverside "is very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you want the Ko-Aus".
Garcia said that the focus was to show drunk, then boxes.
Both said that they could feel the momentum built for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on this, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I waited for the top fighters and that is Mikey.
It will be a great battle. '
Four injured after Reifenplatzer
In an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
After first information, the driver lost an Opel Zafira against 16.30 on the front of the terminal market wide probably after a tyre burner the control over his vehicle.
The passenger car dragged to the right into the evil, where he was overflowing and then lying on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial provision of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked in the direction of north for about an hour, and then the traffic could be forwarded to the accident centre on the left.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Dreierkette works better".
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2: 2 to the season start against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue points.
With the first season game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result, would not have been the two counterparts at the 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"The two counterparts were too much, and we need to fit in Aue even better," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge, the Dreierkette should be further optimized.
And a gateway to free up the Fortunes will no longer be imagined.
"For the future it will be so that none more besides Michael (Rensing) puts on the line".
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also be able to cope better with the experience in preparing the trio than the four-wheel.
"I do not know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have just built up in the three-quarters on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build the good", said Hoffmann.
"Prerequisite, but that we are still better harmonised and we are not doing so many mistakes in building up."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"Whether you can talk about a failed start, you don't know.
The performance could well be okay, "I hope.
"If we go on Sunday with four points and focus on the pool, we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season takt."
That was not what his trainer wanted to know.
"The start in the season I only judge after six to eight days of game", said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony had to be aborted early due to an accident.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that the players from Aue might even be a little more fresh, because they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorites in the bones.
"But they do not know so 100% where they are currently", says the interior defender Fortuna.
Although the guests from the Rhineland are easier than favorites on Sunday to meet at last (almost) ready-made stadium of Aue.
"That we swept them away only because we are entitled to come under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance sheet is only one defeat against Aue from nine games is positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which you have to beat from the start", explains Fortunas chief coach.
"Such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant".
And so Funkel does not want to experience his player on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Review Test published
The recent results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of those tested are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are to be more precise during the asylum procedure when the Swedish migration authority (migration tax) was criticised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minor years.
To date, migration has been reduced to 880 cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person "may be 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are fairly constant", he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases suggesting that the person investigated 18 years or older ".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet observed the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which is similar to the X-ray inspection of Weisheitszähnen and MRT recordings of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska-Instituts, whose work covers the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they used to be or later as usual by the puberty.
"I had reason to think about this and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say it, we should not pretend that we could ', he said the newspaper Metro.
Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is incorrect to judge is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is under 18, this is roughly 10%. "
Full Plan
The works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge on the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it runs super", says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Government Bureau Freiburg.
In April, work began at the same time on all three sanation-needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the building is scheduled for October and light is sure that the timetable is adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge from concrete that has a red buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure the stability and safety of transport, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built from red buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap on the northern side of the morning.
This is a fringe fastening which is also used as an operating route.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 meter wide bridge is to be used on Friday.
That is what the pedestrian route is supposed to be.
The special thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already covered with patented bridges.
Particular sensitivity has required the laying of wires through the construction work in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fiber cable connected to many companies.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by hand.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the collecting wine in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher Ortseingang, the road in the area of the bridge is locked to the height of the hotel "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden".
The cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest bei deutschem Kartoffelsalat at
It does not happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is difficult to get under a guard.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, left) represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, FWG, left) belong to a broad alliance that shows this day peacefully flag, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell, according to the poster "big campaign" invites.
And well known names at the start - as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on 24 September, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch.
But those who want to be on the spot before the event begins do not want to listen to the AfD artists, but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the Picknick town was planned under the motto "All on a table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now on the parking lot below the Rondells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that can be found here.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the authoritative organizers, is right: "Toll, as many people have come together here".
There are music and lots of food, including a "urdeutscher Kartoffelsalat, which could also eat the AfD without any problems", says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, she shows presence especially at the train station, which is only a few metres from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he tried to get such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
With a view to the Rondellvorplatz event, he says: "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
This is also happening: the Rondellvorplatz provides a band for entertainment in the city hall, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD-Chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy Chairman Beatrix of Storch to keep their speeches.
The police presence has changed, but so far officials have had a quiet evening.
A bit more than an hour takes the AfD event, which guests have a longer breath on the pitch, but also there is a short time after 21 o'clock.
The police can move away - no special incidents.

Now I look back and think: 'Girls, be proud of you!'.
Especially the public don't want to live their love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and annoy me.
And perhaps some people call me undankbar, but I do not like to have to justify myself to the whole public. '
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party.
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he will change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the democrats have removed me, "said Gouverneur Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in Jubel.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a trainer, I would say it is time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire elected in the state in 2016.
Forbes notes that he possesses coal mines in five states, and inherited from his father a carbon business.
It is worth around $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, saying: 'The change of party from Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working more than it would make our country great again'.
"With only 15 governements and the control of the least-legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is up to the bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," said the RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement CBS News.
Coe praises' honest 'Russian excuse for doping scandal
The global leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resumed in sport.
Russia ’ s athletic leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Light athletics World Championships that the ban on his country was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said it sorry for "all athletes who were torn away at competitions gold and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was today a very open answer, a very honest presentation", said IAAF-President Coe the reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also 'pleased' that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-use Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the deceased system, he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will begin on Friday in London after the tough IAAF criteria as neutral players.
The head of the IAAF-Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free to act, he said reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.
Trauerakt soldiers stormed in Mali
At a ceremony in the northern Hesse Fritzlar, around 1000 people of the two Mali helicopter deported soldiers have been commemorating.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high safety precautions.
Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unexplained crash.
She described the two pilots but as "Could her specialist".
"We deny ourselves the highest sacrifices they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from Nordhessen had died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Her sentences were passed to Germany and accompanied on Thursday by a Totenwache of the Bundeswehr in the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At midday, only the members of the church began to take part.
After that, the marriage ceremony began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them, Hessen ’ s prime minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wie.
Trauergäste laid down Rosen, who were members of Arm in Arm an den Särgen.
Before the church, Fritzlarer and many soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Secretary of State of Defense of the Leyen described the killed soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced them.
The Stabshauptmann used the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regime.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the Regiment, who belonged to the soldier, declared: "If this occupation could not have avoided the crash, then it would not have been able to" mocht ".
Doubts of the UN mission in Mali showed Minister Leyen not: the use is dangerous.
But he is also of high importance for a country that we are separated only by two states, "she said.
After the funeral, the sawmills were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide information.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife.
The man of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), wants not to be overshadowed after his death alongside his wife.
The divided the royal house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are attached to the church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already completed a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agrees with the decision of her husband, it continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik begraben will be, be unclear.
However, he did not intend to be included in his French home.
Prince Henrik never made a flour that he was not happy with his title.
After the throne's approval of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have king.
In 2016, he retired, including the title "Prince number".
As Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted, he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after the death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, be unclear.
However, he did not intend to be placed in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He may have worked for the country he has worked in the last 50 years.
The born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French aristocracy, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the subject in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, the sympathies of the people were always overflowing, Prince Henrik had a serious state of affairs in his nearly 50 years of rain with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "Few months after my arrival everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was pregnant, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, Tennis instead of Football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I saw instead of Virginia tobacco and which allowed the reputation to be the trademark of societal critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was two mistakes! '
Prime Minister Because he wants a speedy re-election
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD), after the loss of the rot-green government majority, wants to resign for a speedy re-election of the landing day, but does not.
Because on Friday the resolution of Parliament spoke out.
Previously, the surprising exit of a Green MEP from her country faction to the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) had plunged into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow approval majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten took their step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in their constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his group be included.
Thus CDU and FDP together 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Landtag, SPD and Greens 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new landing day will be elected regularily on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the rot-green government must now decide whether it could govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the day of the land should be resolved as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the country ’ s day will be deprived of the prime minister ’ s confidence and a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined in legal terms, "said Thümler.
"You will discuss all the issues in peace when they are legally reasonable."
Thümler called Twestens Schritt "doch etwas kurios".
The politician himself stressed: 'I am not a betrayal.
I feel very good. '
She described herself as an Annexes of Black Green.
The Greens called for the breakaway Members to return their country's mandate.
"We assume, of course, that they will be given their daily mandate, which they have received via the green national list, with immediate effect," the leaders of the country, Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The chairman of the Green Group, Mr Piel, said: 'We very much regret the decision by Elke Twesten'.
You have chosen not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the overthrow of the Anglo-Saxon Green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate, but also betrayal of Red Green," the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Friday on Facebook.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil's decision (SPD) to quickly re-elect the day of the country.
The exit of Twestens costs Rot-Grün in Niedersachsen the majority.
The politician, "in her injured vanity and in her frustration, criticized her personal interests for the good of the country" SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is scandalous that the CDU, in Lower Saxony, is taking advantage of this dirty intrigue game and trying to capitalize on it."
Niedersachsens CDU-Fraktionschef Björn Thümler wants to recommend his fellow MEPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, warf Twesten, with personal careers giving away the result of the 2013 country election.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, SPD, and Greens had a thin majority on the day of the country.
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the German editorial network (RND) speech and.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure.
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the affected egg chargers.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even though we now know that health risks are virtually impossible, especially as regards what we know.
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlighter is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Despite this, my House has immediately switched on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the acquaintance of Germany.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are safe and healthy.
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded, these are not traffic able.
Unpolluted eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it is not the fault of companies.
Are production companies and consumers sitting on the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production companies are not directly responsible.
Instead, they must expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there is too little control in the crop case.
Is there only a lack of staff or even a coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handover to the prosecutors in cases where offences can be identified are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide full information.
Is regular alarm really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain safe and traffickable food exclusively..
If a non-authorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
This means that manufacturers, dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the attitude of animal suppliers is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
It is important to work consistently at all levels and with high pressure.
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are resolved swiftly and fully.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymars ’ move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unfettered expenditure of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars World Record Transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Somewhat the consequences will be for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, because the leading organisation that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League Tournament.
Financial fair-play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million (262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can make money with security, so Neymar subwrites it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy rich ruler family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to control break-even point in their soccer business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs, which had relied on enormous debt in their quest for success, had effectively cheated and risked to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential bought and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.
And, while Platini fell from the presidency in 2015, UEFA ’ s successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to favor discouraging excessive spending.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, opposite The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for the settlement over the duration of its contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the redeemable for the next five years can be expelled at the end of the year from EUR 44.4 million.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by raising their revenue through companies connected with the owners of a club.
While a catarian company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring exceeds the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.
This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments of the organizing committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors, and that such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday people familiar with the situation.
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved more than EUR 10 million in sales of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year must be published.
PSG expects Neymars to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymars moving away by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily newspaper AS in relation to Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports team, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"Once a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because there are different ways or different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country. '
Swiss is looking for a new shaft supplier.
In recent years Chocolat Frey Bord-Chochocolate has been produced for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is coming to an end: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.
According to current planning, the Airline will enter into a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be tested and tested every two to three years.
"With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied", said the spokesman.
Around 17 million small red white packaged chimneys to 14 grams each year, accompanied by landing on passengers.
The Swiss did not want to make any information about the costs.
Industry insider appreciates the order volume according to "Nordwestschweiz" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros-Tochter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: for a shoe manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
Like many applicants in the new tender, Swiss does not want to betray.
But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to renew the treaty beyond spring 2018.
For sda the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate labels have been distributing Swiss flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss had signed a contract with Migros ’ daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had delivered the chocolate tablets.
The possibility to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, customers of First Class will be pampered with leaks from Confiserie Sprüngli, Business Class naschen passengers Schoggi of Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
The Swiss Schoggi circuit is also spread across Chocolat Frey, both Business and Economy Class.
Easy athletic - Discussion Olympic Champion Robert Harting reaches WM-Finale
The triumphal World Champion is fighting a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, Olympiasieger of 2016, failed in the national WM-exclusion, and could only look at the discus competition from the gallery.
Also with the first attempt qualified the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who was 65.13 meters wide, for the final fight.
Nostalgie goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the niche pocket.
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s greeting era (as the thinking David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch-Komödie "The State" for MTV turned), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook able era of permanent memories.
But as Franchise it feels like the time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a speaking dose vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By playing at the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play ghostly children who are grown - they still managed to regain the impossibility of regaining the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more after the Gießkannenprinzip, including a reef on the Stalker movies of the 90s as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand, the Cradle").
At a point stöbert a character through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and a series of other things from 1991 ".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, Katie (Marguerite Moreau) has still not forgotten.
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy malicious plot in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the courses are the best part of the franchise.
It makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillons underlip bart of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old boy.
It is the moments of random madness that this franchise could fuel like a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I think his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how they visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East versus West Ring-combat iconography.
Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created the comedy with Rhys Thomas as a director, to be a dedicated TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism.
The main roles - a hard-won Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to the reputation (the police spend the time watching chess on television, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous spokesmen - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a reagan-mask - that it often plays like a single.
In six long episodes, the comedy is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which has a smaller length of redirected, could deliver its agitprop acid better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visited the American embassy whose lobby is occupied by two thick men who squander a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything feed for a gelage.
The fictitious Romanian creators are not wrong: we are even doing it with our own younger history and with their theirs.
Beat Drug Mafia in the Land
The police have managed to strike the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, in the Black Forest district, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects were searched, such as the Public Prosecutor Konstanz on Friday.
At the age of 25, 15 defendants were arrested and arrest warrants were issued against them.
Moreover, the officials provided larger quantities of Marihuana and Kokain, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in Italy at the same time.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italians.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
Overall, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor Konstanz has been investigating the organized drug trade in southern Germany.
Between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo, there was an exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
Ins Visier of the investigations, especially Italian nationals, referred to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired early in the morning, should go to the band's account.
Thus, large gaps in the length of the register are compl.
"Data from citizens who should not appear": according to a report, the Foreign Register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government ’ s Beauftragte for the management of refugees, Frank-Jürgen Lücken, drew attention to large gaps in the register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could result in asylum procedures and deportations' leading to some serious misjudgments, in a way called in an analysis presented by the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the register, ten million people are covered by foreign nationality, including 5.7 million non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because data has not been sufficiently maintained, data quality has not been good so far.
In individual cases, data had been found in 1921, "by people who are no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register".
"Error data input can significantly slow back processes," says the report.
In statistics on people who are travelling abroad, EU citizens who do not have to travel.
However, such false regulations have led to a distorted debate on how to deal with foreigners', which is to say, the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government appears to have begun to send refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children when they have entered there.
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), which reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
In the paper, therefore, the BAMF introduces such procedures' relating to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017.
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, so the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
After the Dublin agreement, it is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they first reach it.
If a migrant can continue to travel to another EU country, this state can send it back to the country of entry.
The reason for this is that the office has now increased considerably for families with minors in Italy.
Italy has made guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), these commitments are sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
The domestic political spokesman in the Linksfraction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children are threatened because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare".
Zweitbestes Result
In total, 220 litres of blood in Oberreichenbach provided blood donation services to other people.
At least 12 citizens, who were awarded on Friday.
In the meantime, Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community praises in the meeting of the municipal council several times the willingness to donate blood.
"It is ingenious how our body is designed and we pay tribute to the donors who make their blood available to foreign people, even to the unselfish", underlined mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people", explained the circle manager of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the preserves are broken into their components.
For example, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in spring.
"In this year we reached the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK team manager.
Obviously, the change to the theatre house just a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were awarded the multiple donors and for 50 blood donations.
Half so many banished Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter ten times the 500 milliliter of their life safes.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%.
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" than it retained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increased pressure.
Policymakers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with less members rising this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for increased.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and to 1.6% in 2018, warning that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just 3% in the fall.
But they signaled that, in the coming years, interest-rate hikes would be needed to rein in inflation fueled by Brexit, saying that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic package that was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will take time for the financing plan to allocate cheaper financial resources to banks next February, although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide GBP 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with GBP 115 billion.
minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on real incomes continues to strain household consumption."
At interest rates, they repeated that 'a certain tightening of monetary policy' would require a slightly greater degree of inflation and a 'greater' than markets expect.
Markets are predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another year in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
The Bank ’ s downward adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell in the face of the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have reduced expectations of an interest-rate hike, and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter of the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easy to recover after the bank ’ s end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage erosion, as tightening becomes even worse before it becomes better.
They added that monetary policy cannot prevent income collapse in the next few years, but they added that wages will recover significantly at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to reach the prices and the economy in full.
Before the Bank ’ s final verdict on interest rates, the call for an interest-rate hike has risen, as inflation has pushed pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding a 0.5% increase in July.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% last month in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and that it will resume in the coming months.
The Bank said that exceeding the target of 2% is' totally 'to be attributed to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive, as creditors are looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who expire the existing deals and complete the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular.
NHS (The National Health Service) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV threats to 10,000 people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and.
Patients will receive preventative treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the NHS drug.
NHS England announced that a preexpositional prophylaxis (PrEP), which can now reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86%, is now estimated to be the first three-year study for 10,000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the process after last year ’ s appeal court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it.
The NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens, announced on Thursday, was welcomed as "important new intervention" while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the HIV transmission of infection risk.
PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or as long as two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a veterinary surgeon can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as used on a large scale, and implemented.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in tackling one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September to September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. '
Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV will be left behind.
Now that the PrEP-Testmedizin has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people. '
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is due after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will contribute to bringing an end to the spread of HIV in society.
The great life is life: intermediate level and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, fell in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack her bags and sold.
"Davor lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room", says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne Stauraum and add an intermediate floor to make the most of the spacious ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, much light.
That was my request, 'she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architect and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, who used 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to life for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces together so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset.
"The steel mill is quite complicated", he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were interconnected without having to fill us.
It was not just a simple platform to build, but a steel platform so that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.
A classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous residential area.
Brick gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to let him work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, divided units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a glamorous area, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Comfortable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering art went there", explains Erfan of stahlverstärkten, furnierten MDF door.
"It is obsessive that if you push the door very easily slip."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the land or how your property is estimated", says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate based on the land size."
Here they managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square metre of something standard in something quite astonishing.
In fact, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers are struggling for a $500 million real estate empire.
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of the largest real estate imperies Victorias, worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton football club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from family operations since 2014, but a sharp confrontation about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since 1973 a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, bought.
The Westco Jeans family was founded there and grew up into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold to USD 85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in town, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.
After an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the assets of the company and Paul about one-third.
A legal act states that this means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul has $176 million in value.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem point for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought to be the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first monkey avit.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, ruled out him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.
In an early monkey avit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority", he wrote.
The costs rise in the case of hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held by law firms.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s a store in Brunswick.
They used the security to buy Collingwood-Liegenschaft in Colin the first jeans shop of the family.
Colin says that he started there when he was "in my last years of High School, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis-group of companies, claiming that the company had paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars.
Both Lukas and Mark were, as Paul says, "the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter".
Colin withheld very much, although he was a former AFL member of the board and after a biography from 2015, Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say 'I really cannot say much' because the case before the courts is.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said and added that he still hopes a solution ".
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts", wrote Colin.
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media abstention.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in the hope of keeping the boss on a more equal course.
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House, which he repaired: bad information that gets into the hands of the president.
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he had received good information. "
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tell Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from places that were to convince", said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control is, according to six former campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady price of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been under control is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know what we do not know - that Trump ’ s tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions.
We will probably never hear anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If his staff managed to keep him away from him several times, their efforts were rewarded.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - dealing with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to give the President strategic reasons dubious information.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clips, especially those with embarrassing leaks, and that he is eager to find out where they come from.
This is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the president malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh accused "to be the source behind a bunch of his leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and has revoked them.
Trump read the article and began asking employees about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram that Trump receives".
How did that work?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still seek influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
The most sought after criminals receive mail from Europol
Because the address is unknown, the population's assistance is inherited and hoped.
The police throughout Europe are sending out virtual postcards to dangerous criminals this summer.
Since the addresses of the swordsman's natures are not known, there are indications from the population and inherited.
Europol reported on Friday of the action followed by the EU Most Wanted Advent Calendar of Winter.
Experience has shown that many fleets of holiday destinations hide, it has been said on the part of Europol.
You have compiled 21 postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online enuctions have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them, on the basis of references to the website.
Travellers negotiate a grave and return to the 'millionaire series'.
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travelers on war feet who have negotiated a tomb from the community to call back a field before their mansions.
Travellers have their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, called the "Millionärs-Reihe".
They have brought horses, babies, and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred from a tomb taken by the Council to prevent their accidents.
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Wütende residents have afflicted the Council of Solihull, who said that it is' useless to deal with the problem '.
An anonymous resident said: "You moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath where they cast stones on the passers-by.
The Council must indeed be forced to implement it, as it was useless when dealing with the problem.
Travellers were there in May, moved and are now back.
More came yesterday evening, probably even more. '
She added: 'The Birmingham Council knows how to circumvent it by holding long submissions to protect its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common tax if the Council cannot even stop it. '
A native who did not want to be mentioned, said: 'It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and even a horse has been seen in the parking area.
A spokesman in the Council of Solihull said: 'We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls together, and we take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case. '
From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise will be.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
After all, the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH to 13 April 2014 lost some 30 000 nights per year and also revenue by the Kurtaxe.
In the autumn of 2014, with the dramatic rise in the numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered as a gathering accommodation, which caused controversy.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the common.
But especially Freudenstadts Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke about the growing interest in the house.
It should retain the right.
The group Luisenhotels with business leader Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Birkenhof Hotel at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus-category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Birkenhof hotel has been in construction for a long time before the entrance, and when you enter the house, you will see how extensive renovation work is carried out.
The floors have been removed, ceilings have been removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It is actually a nice hotel", says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should be "beautiful to the people", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry".
Swimming pool, wellness area and meeting room are among the facilities.
You do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but you have already emphasized an upscale inner city level.
The Waldhotel Luise, with about 60 rooms, is very wide and explains Scherer.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause have already led him, so Scherer.
The city ’ s ideas are identical to those of the Hotel-Group.
"We are on the same line."
According to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define exactly.
Almost under one million euros, he expects.
The exterior panels are also mounted on the front, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russland affair: US Special Counsel sets a jury.
In US President Donald Trump ’ s Russia affair, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is supposed to have set up a so-called Grand Jury report.
The panel started work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" in appeal with the cause trusted people.
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations.
The CNN transmitter reported that there are already first invitations of the body related to a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin of deliberately intervening in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller examines whether Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow were there.
In the focus of the investigation, several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as a consultant to the Republicans.
Reports suggest that Mueller also has more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Counsel Trump personally put Trump at the center and investigated the allegation that the president may have hindered justice as a result of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether or not to charge it.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictments.
Most of them are switched on when they are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The body can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to interrogation under oath.
According to the CNN channel, charges have already been issued to turn the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to say that they were called upon to do so in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump ’ s Jr., Trump ’ s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his campaign leader, Paul Manafort, were there to talk.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the appointment of Mueller should not be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he should act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the charge.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body of the start of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia's history is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives democrats an opportunity to feel "good, because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion, he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.
However, they usually work in secret, emphasized.
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the 'fair' special intermediaries.
The former FBI boss James Comey said three times that not against the president would be determined.
One has no reason to assume that something has changed, it has been said in the statement.
Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this rush, accusations against Trump had become louder, he wanted to impede justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump asked him to stop investigating the then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agents and his staff.
That triggered speculation about whether Trump wants to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent special medium of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair, Richard Nixon resigned to the president, Mueller, who could theoretically be taxed at the insistence of the president of the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday, after which the special mediators could no longer be dismissed.
Antarctica: Gigantischer Eisberg drives Antarctica
In the West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size Berlin has been resolved by the Schelfeis.
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut für Polar- und Meeresforschung am Mittwoch mit.
More than a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of large colossus are now going to need two or three years to melt.
It has 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the last three decades.
There is no danger to people.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear after research.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs of icebergs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken Koloss has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
As a result, the sea continues to grow and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America at the tip of the antarctic peninsula.
Nördlich dieses Schelfeises war das Balance von Wachsen und Abbrechen vor einigen Jahren gestört.
A complete slap is there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edges have never gone as far as they are at present.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can fall apart if a key spot is dropped.
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea levels, as they swim on the water and sweat ice as much water as the result of melting itself.
However, the loss of the cowardly means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could perhaps increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, the British research project to monitor Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shark coat of Antarctica according to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
From the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge of the free ocean around 200 meters.
It breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the most far-reaching retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Scientists are contentious about whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow up again or, in the long term, go back and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say that it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many icebergs of the Antarctic Peninsula have declined in recent decades.
This long cid of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Ice Areas of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950 ’ s.
As a result, temperature increases have contributed.
The Antarctic Peninsula has grown by about three degrees in the last 50 years, and is thus one of the areas where the temperature is fastest.
CDU wants domestic tariff for staff.
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU is calling for the employers ’ association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Kreistag has gone through 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day.
The apprenticeships appear to be very sought-after.
Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circle of staff is still lacking in order to meet the increased requirements and tasks. and.,,,,,,,,,,,,
At the moment, Mettmann still has 50 vacancies.
Amongst other things, doctors and engineers, as well as the general administration, are invited.
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the district day and to oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
The administration is to draw up a concept for personnel acquisition and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract future-oriented applicants' scarcity.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, specific measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were previously unknown.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of a genuine 'competition of public employers'.
This involves a high number of employees who are ill or older due to the service.
So maximum time for action, so that there are no more jobs left.
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He has long since been in the Kreistag for a faustdicke surprise when he publicly questioned the personal-cost cap and hired the other parties.
Peoples want all the possibilities to be reviewed, which will allow the withdrawal from the communal employers' association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the circle administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the local communities - should seek a house tariff ', so peoples.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the collective bargaining system for the public service.
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money only if you change to a higher level that is oriented to professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up in which employees care about the provisions of the new prostitutes law.
Last but not least, by increasing numbers of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy is tightening the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turiner daily La Stampa.
Minniti ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Save', because their team effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed accusations of the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority, so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
"We can judge all the accusations that are being made at the moment only after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Youth Save', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew is carrying snake boats on board, which are delivered directly by traffickers, and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Act of Public Prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.
The occupation is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to keep to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring 'essential changes or disabilities' to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organization Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) is., and., and,,.
Minniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
Anstiege and Trials
Neun Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly Guides were available for this purpose.
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It was followed by vantage points, partly on towers from which one could look far beyond the woods and the lagpla.
There has been an ever-increasing increase in numbers for the long trials.
On the second day, after Bad Dürkheim went to Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, viewpoint is linked to viewpoint, through "flowige" trials and moderate increases.
On the last two days, many elevations were met again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shopping huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathe a holistic saline in the outdoor air.
Neustadt was also fired.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally -.
Konsole statt Rasen - Bundesliga rüstet sich für E-Sport Sport.
Are sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of blowing through the wind and weather over the stadium?
Fact is: E-Sport has long become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages including.
This is also the first Bundesliga, which is increasingly engaged in this field.
In early 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04, and last but not least the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "on this train still etliche Vereine aufsteigen".
Next weekend, FIFA World Cup organizes the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where the gamclubs of.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football must deal, in particular, with the 14 to 30 year old, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under the Treaty, one could be present online much more often on these markets than only once a year to send the federal team to Asia.
What exactly is this about?
At E-Sport, computer games like "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the football simulation are challenged at competitive level.
Lonely, as in normal sport, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And in Asienspielen 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly needed.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the Deutscher Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions, which you also find in classical sports - for example increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, and a rapid response capability.
Professional gamers should not only train to the console, but also train their bodies and respect the diet.
"The fitte player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Inspections are difficult to carry out online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.
The scientists highlight the high integrative effect of e-sport.
Players are on the international stage, as there is a large global family, because there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts that E-Sport will have rapid growth.
In 2016, in Germany, EUR 50 million was implemented, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years' time, sales will be 130 million.
There is little against the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the football league.
However, E-Sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "write the Deloitte consultant.
Many countries are already more international.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-baseballstar Alex Rodriguez is participating in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood-Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
Europe is also doing a lot.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a subject of instruction, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and in France, football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department, according to Dutt.
"In European comparison, Germany lags behind", says VfB Board Röttgermann.
Only in nostalgia to fall, and the old times too cripple, today is no longer enough.
It is a question of preserving the tradition of the association, but also of aligning the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world", says Dutt.
"It is not possible to hold on to the fact that only football remains as it was always."
Gift eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking.
From the scandal surrounding toxic eggs, almost all of the federal states are now affected.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and Germany has taken all eggs out of sale.
In the shelves, only eggs are to be taken, which are demonstrably not contained in a fipronil.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts urging Conrad Roy for suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been exposed to the currency.
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is untreated.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal.
It was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but its legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered a mental illness.
In red trousers and a creamy flower dressed, Carter was dressed with tears in the eyes, filled with old hands and down-facing eyes when she was convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"They ended his life to make their own better.
She has not assumed any responsibility, "she said.
"She has not shown any repertoire".
But Carter's lawyer said that it is a 'terrible circumstance, which she completely deplores'.
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that their "age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions".
A Public Prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is no day on which I did not regard the loss of my beloved son.
I would like him to be proud of me and how I am dealing with everything, and I try, despite all my pain that we will bear for eternity with us, to be here for his sisters', that is to say it.
Roys Schwester, Camdyn Roy, said that she was persecuted by the knowledge that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children.
"Not to have this single person with whom I have been since my birth every day, is a pain I will keep for the rest of my life always with me" she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts to call for a crime to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text releases revealed that it encouraged him to end his life.
"Häng dich auf, spring von einem Gebäude, ersteche dich selbst, ich weiß nicht, es gibt viele Wege", sagte sie in mehreren Nachrichten, die sie in den zwei Wochen vor seinem Tod geschickt hatte, während er mit seiner Familie im Urlaub war.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "You must do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from any press in the case.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to two years ago for murder in Italy because of her British fellow resident, was released in 2007.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: 'Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new Mini-Lahm of FC Bayern Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run in the Audi Cup as a captain is no coincidence.
The FC Bayern mourns the Confed-Cup winner to a big season - Extra-motivation does not harm.
Something was different from his place in the cabin that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even if the extra piece of clothing was very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, no Philipp Lahm, and no Manuel Neuer, he made the bind he shared to the arm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The trainer has not announced it", told the Confed-Cup winner, after his first bet as Bayern-Kapitän.
Well, the booth could have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of Coach was able to interpret Kimmich as well.
Not eight years old Arturo Vidal was chosen in the youth players, debutants and straight out of the holiday professional C-Elf as the leader of the game, but he.
Sugar is best distributed among those who want to mourn a great deal that you want to keep at Laune.
So if you have been asked to challenge Lahm ’ s legacy, you can use a small extra motivation only well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want to assume as a player: responsibility".
On Wednesday the 22-year-old fled as a mini-spawning over the field.
Right behind, this is his position, the white bind on the arm did its rest.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this start-up formation like the one that can best take the ruder in hand.
He gave instructions, tried to distract the invaded force.
He had a look at the whole thing, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal, who missed his lack of fitness (scarcely appte); Renato Sanches so that on devil comme raus the services of the Asia trip (also due to his); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that in her first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot did not fall negatively.
After all, that was a good thing.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy before defense, both acted sovereign.
The Napoli storm was often difficult to fill, and additionally, Süle tried to successfully build a few times in the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was not as we hoped.
But he also showed a decent performance in debut.
Moving on, Tempovich: "For this style I was also fetched".
As unusually, this Bayern-World still lives for the newcomers, one looked after the parties.
Rudy, for example, gave in the catacombs not one or two, but appointed six or seven interviews.
Kimmich passed after a few scarce statements in the back of his new player.
There he heard from Süle an interesting sentence: "What was done here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria you just have to win every game ".
After all, it must no longer bring the new one.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria ’ s best-known soccer tester has just reported on Twitter and the ÖFB ladies wish all the best.
The Bayern-Legionär is almost Klubkollege von ÖFB-Kapitänin Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our Ladys.
The Tweet of the Austrian soccer of the year and Champions-League winner should be a special motivational injection.
The famous Bayern-Dusel may well need our ladies.
Companies satisfied with the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economics praises Wissings Tempo
It often reconciled the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Kammern und Unternehmen aus der Region sprechen auf T V-Anfrage von einem Wandel in der Wirtschaftspolitik - und tadeln gleichzeitig die alte Ministerin.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
The biggest U-turn looks at NATO ’ s infrastructure policy: the bridge between Kelberg and Adenau lies in the country ’ s priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes to establish a plan procedure until 2021.
A role in the country ’ s plans also plays the West circumvention of Trier, which faces the urgent need for the Federal Traffic Path.
The goal is to start operation in December 2020, Minister Cornelia Holtmann says.
Natus sees it as a way of supporting regional, but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier is striving to increase the sales in supermarkets and to halt the trend of German wine exports for ten years.
Moreover, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Handwerkskammer sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new championship bus, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of EUR 1000 for the best championship and EUR 2500 for graduates within ten years after the championship training.
The home list for the country remains for a while.
In the planned road construction, facts are quick to create, but at the same time, the country lacked the necessary staff, Jan Glockauer, the chief executive of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to adapt Wissing to local mobility, 29 posts have been filled up so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU fraction vize Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million less in receiving national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
What is more, the current broadband expansion in the country is soaring.
In 2016, regional companies assessed the power supply in an IHK poll only with the note 3.4.
They complain about stocking Internet connections and breakdowns.
On the other hand, former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the windmills ’ supervisory board Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they had already cleared the field after four months because of inconsistencies.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash.
A day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that 'there are more intelligent options than restrictions on driving', and referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a call back.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines can be considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of car manufacturers to install systems for neutralising diesel vehicles is also too difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also being accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called end-of-life equipment, in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested, but in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were charged by Volkswagen, others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month the former head of the thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the auditors accused of having installed a system to circumvent emission regulations in Europe, and a question that was focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the study could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer transfers disproportionately to Volkswagen.
This message has the Floss on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to make the Isar visitors participate, a special message will be sent by Munich on Saturday.
On Saturday, turn again to Isar, who will see a big river between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a usual river with Isar tourists.
Special reference will be given to the building.
On the river you see a large Infotransparent.
It shows a rubbish mountain.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is..." the understanding for the Isar is to be sharpened as a protected wildlife.
Last summer, the river over the Isar and this year there were other actions and measures to achieve a ruthless and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knollennasen and laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoons drawing, the node havens of his figures are his trademark.
Also with 85 records of the Argentines and works on a film.
His message: laughter, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first few years as an artist, he proposed, among other things, as a drawing for happiness cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost", he said again.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris he succeeded in the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artists of cities inspire themselves.
Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he is still sitting on the drawing table, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plushy and watches will continue to spread worldwide.
For six years he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos favorite animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I do not know exactly what they will say it is strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he is more interested in the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without worries.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is due to the drought conditions and to the diseases of communicable insects, and for the time being, what scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions are causing major headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert in the field of agriculture research CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the last few years, which brought much less rain in spring and in autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small Zikade, a microbakterium, which carries the dwarf kaden, and in very dry weather there are very many of them.
And there is much at stake.
Lavender lures not only for holidaymakers but also for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having a very long plant ear with a large number of flowers, we have underdeveloped smaller, either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil. '
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drying.
The town of Geisa in Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary.

The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The workers of the weekly Riodoce usually meet in Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials, and ceaseless drug wars.
But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what is more secure: they are supposed to take their children into the office, which was the goal of an attack with grenades, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and building chairs are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government ’ s salary or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from violence, and, throughout the country, the bodies are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012, 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection, and there have been at least seven deaths this year in seven states.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder of the Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is felt deep, although his presence everywhere is present - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", depends on the façade of the Riodoce building, two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Iand Miri, wearing T-shi, the face with glasses or his typical panamah.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their divided themes, the trauma, their nightmares, nightmares, paranoia.
Although a special public prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inseparable and even though the terrain is now even more traitive.
Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we do not know why, we trust all."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was recruited by two men, forcing him to leave his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfters River".
The shooter drove in his car and damaged it near.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlegrounds, as rival groups are fighting to fill the vacuum.
There is nothing to make out that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for one minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), is a co-founder and director of Riodoce, blaming him for not protecting his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rival anti-trust groups in the war with Guzmans Söhnen.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected Gangmitglieder bought each copy of the issue when it was delivered to newspaper kiosk.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave his own security after the seizure of another newspaper published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold USD 50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to conduct journalism without encountering the Rauschgift-problem," said Bojorquez.
The newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising.
Reporter loves to publish tough inquiries without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it led them.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to continue living", he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You have to take over the task that you are a journalist - either you or you play the shower.
I do not want to be asked: "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team missing Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who, like a dock worker, could flood the friend who was generous with impoverishment and advice, was a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his spoils?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive.
"You don't like it if you are dealing with their women, their children, their clean shops, their homely start-up and landing tracks" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed", said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it is wrong, stay away from it.
The anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space in which Riodoce ’ s staff were trained for security, no mobile phones were suddenly allowed.
Draußen suchten zwei Polizisten Schutz vor der Hitze von 104 Grad (40 ° C) im Schatten eines Baumes.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers are among the 50% of the policemen that the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For the edition of this week Riodoce has licked on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending focused on the hometown of the governor.
And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the Public Prosecutor, a kidnapping.
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) that dominated almost the entire century all political levels.
More recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez's column considered the best informed source of abduction.
"Previously we had known what happened", said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources".
The Valdez office was dedicated to storing space for signs and stickers that protested against the murders of journalists, because the staff had become something they had never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the Public Prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder in protest by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on pay and buildings.
On this day, the director Bojorquez away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they said the truth.
Since then, she has asked for the government to be re-allocated because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, by the government officials involved and by an equal society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also by command of politicians and security forces who were steadfast with organized crime.
The Media Guard group "Articulo 19" has ordered more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouths", said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the bloggers Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.
Your body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel: "Here I am because of my reports".
A computer keyboard and headphones in addition to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a editorial on the title page with the heading "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists are fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who, together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, said that drug trafficking is frightening him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and so I was reporter," he said.
To finish midnight last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones started to summen.
A series of shooters with bandwidth valves and security forces near the Battleground Mazatlan left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of cartels in the region.
From the bordstone edge they have published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phones.
The title page had to be changed on the next day.
This year's sirens were near - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez warf a look at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were willing.
If they were afraid at all, they did not.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his traces.
"As you can also only remember to close", said Bojorquez, "if on the same day when Javier was murdered, the internship asked me to send them to the street".
Dinosaur used Tarnung to escape his enemies.
At first glance it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorns of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so good that they could even find that their gloves were of Roman brown skin - and they said they would have had something of a "troubled past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described it as "the best-preserved dinosaur he ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, living in the middle of chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well preserved state has discovered researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable".
According to reports in National Geographic, the best-preserved fossil of its kind is the plant frescoes.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was at Suncor Millenium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rocks and decided to look more closely.
The Fossil discovered by him in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2.500 pound (1.100 kg) heavy earthwise.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be filled.
"If you only blink a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientists in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to see.
"It will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
Researchers have found that this plant fresser, although it is covered with an armor and a changing tank, is likely to send meat eating dinosaurs threatened.
The dinosaur used a red and white tar to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as countercoating, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed him to mix better in his environment and to avoid his enemies, experts say what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours covering it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of drawers and armor over his body.
They discovered the shading of Konterschattierung, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the shading is customary, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur has been hunted by enough pressure by meat, dinosaur, that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use conterization - think of Rehe, Zebras, or Gürteltiere - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Starkes Raubtier-behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of chalk time must have been", said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal's evidence of his life, including his conserved intestine, to find out what it eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was driven into a river and into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed.
At this time Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much further inland than they are today.
"This Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with a conservative skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal", said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same as in the early chalk time.
You don't need much imagination to use to reconstruct it.
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur he was driven by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta has been contaminated and mummified after death in the sea.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was at Suncor Millenium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the Schnauze to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 metres) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20 tariff peaks, which raged from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that the plagued plant carnivores were swamped by Western Canada until a flood of river flooded into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The remnants of this special specimens are so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered by wood panzers along the dinosaurs. and.,, and.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in Lotto.
The more I see it, the more confusing it will.
Fixed residues of the skin still cover the holy panels that bear the skull of the animal.
His right forehead is on his side, his five fingers are spun upwards.
I can count the drawers on his sole.
In the thunderstorm: Mass karambolage on A8: Many injured people.
Heftier accident on Thursday evening at the A8: Knapp 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are many injured, kilometres of traffic jams and gaffer.
On the highway Stuttgart-München (A8), about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carambolage.
According to the first figures of the police, at 5 p.m., between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg county) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were transported elsewhere.
The exact number of injuries initially did not provide any information.
It is a light to medium serious injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely closed to Munich.
In the direction of Munich, about ten kilometres of backlog was formed.
As an AZ reporter reported, there was also a massive disability in return - due to numerous cases.
The fire brigade took note of the vehicle's signs, which now have severe penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45, an accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
It was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group testet "Comfort Check-in" in "
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever seen: nothing is on the train and sleeps.
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant idea.
And then: pufff.
If the Schaffner and wears an unsanft or rides the passenger in the midst of the workflow.
Tickets control.
But the times of interruptions are over soon.
The German Railways are currently testing the creators of free ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket.
There is currently a test run on two routes.
"Come the offer, we extend it.
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany, "said a railway precher.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the driver card depreciation without Schaffner.
In order to be able to use it, however, some conditions need to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers do.
You also have to buy it via the App of the Railway, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticketing.
Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get to the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation appears when testing customers.
The attendant will receive a message on their mobile devices that passengers X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant knows that there is a passenger with already depreciated online ticket at the Y ticket control station.
We can therefore continue to sleep, continue working, not to mention.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which is to use the passenger.
"If you want to travel with our train attendant without ticketing, check in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal ", says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are among the greatest annoyances. are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For it is often the case that you do not have all the documents you need to evaluate online tickets.
Either the credit card is missing or the identity card or any document you have to present.
The result is endless discussions between cabin crew and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the cabin or large room and delays in the control of their own tickets and ends up taking time to address other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this also applies only to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Only one day after they arrived in New York City, sat in St. Louis prayer on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on their phone.
She stumbled on a post from someone from the High School.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street," it said there.
Confuse, since no one else posted on their feed the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly on their timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis area was killed by the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He postete an image of browns live body that was broadcast on the street and would stay there four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She put her mobile phone to return to Tweets later on the evening on the Canfield-Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man who claimed to be browser father who signed a sign: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellenden dog.
In another video, she said she escaped another policeman his rifle and cried: "I will kill you... animals all."
"This is not customary," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical."
At this moment I felt joyful.
I was angry and weinte. "
You booked a return flight and went home on the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that consists of the view of the people who live in the community and who have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell, with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two promised a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state «.
"You just remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" they remembered what they said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and was not right.
I could not take them away, "said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
They must know and see it and they are raised.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and black constitution, and what we must do to free ourselves from being free.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she is personally not blatant racism, she is not different from the next black women's child.
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep them away. '
The first station, when it was in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism changed after August 9," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. '
weeks later, Ferrell met a demonstration at Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document only "what happened.
A question came from Ferrell in the sense: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism has been fed by countless cases of people, often whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently said in an interview: "We had heard people born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices were not centred and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already cooperated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death tractor occupants.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us.
"This was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, because I will be presented."
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messias leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from Whose Streets show "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell ’ s life as they fall in love and marry her wife.
"I felt like naked", said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I have understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the process of humanizing black people."
Moreover, Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, pregnant women in leadership positions have supported the movement as a whole", said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.
Black, pregnant women must bear the brunt of everything. '
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement really is held up by black women and many black women".
However, it is important that "this is not a affirmative type of action" selected at the Ferrell because of its identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who raised this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, even though it was at the forefront because of a life at these crosses as a black gay woman so much at stake.
You can feel your energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on the currency for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
However, she is clinging to a song and she feels obliged to remember it since then, three years ago in Ferguson on the street.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love each other and support.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. '
From "dream" to "scale": TV readers discuss Bit-Galerie Galerie.
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it has not been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been outdated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in proponents and opponents.
Kalt leaves the topic little.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.
While the one to the Bit Gallery say: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Do not man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Größenwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters are counting on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be blown out.
In addition, the gallery is planned on the plot on which the farm market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the building work will be finished.
The Galerie-Macher want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Rooms: "We have been buying a farm hall for many years almost weekly.
Our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the women of the land are always very welcome.
Metzgerei has also been discovered for us.
We would like to see this offer maintained during and above all after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there is also.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting.
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent.
However, the new project is unlikely to be very low.
Eva Kilic: "Wozu Einkaufspaläste in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There are already enough in our city.
You can see how many Ladengeschäfte have been here for months and years.
As there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least get the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly directly offered by the producer and is worth the price above.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
It is a pity that there are almost no more special deals and what is left of them will disappear.
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit me together.
And the gallery does not fit in to Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmer market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the Bit Gallery actually comes.
Or does it create the Gespenst Bit Gallery before selling all the shops from Bitburg? "
George Marquet: "This will simply not work.
And a shopping center that is empty also needs no one.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farm market, rather than this gallery.
But for a farmer market hall gib it is no longer a place thanks to the madness of many - as I find - pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farmers' market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. '
A matching similarity: Artist creates Portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA.
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which almost unnoticeable - the cod of the ceiling hangs.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarschnitten, who were sent by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the sections from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst had to serve a 35-year-old prison sentence after she classified classified classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming Resemblance (a suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a woman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, created by Manning, and made from the 30 portraits, as someone with this genomic data might look, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to create identity.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward, but has been open since its puberty about identification as a woman, was convicted of 20 indictments in 2013, including six breaches of espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
The prison suppressed her image so much that there was only one photograph - a basket, black and white selfie, in which Manning is obviously sitting on a driver's seat and wearing an inblonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was hit by the great success of her 2012-project Stranger Visions.
It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette mutilation and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people might look like.
This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"She conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and she wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not attend this time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse were exchanged for unequal correspondence, which in the course of two years changed several letters.
They even created a comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo "Suppressed Images", which saw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would transform it and would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, that Mannings would demand release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new tweet ways to address the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a given reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is equipped with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which is sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the advanced scientific lexikon of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hopefully will take away is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are" said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are".
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above comic novel.
She shows Manning how she appears in the hands of the disciplines of the United States like King-Kong.
"If you cut your speech, you won it," it says.
"So never stop the mouth".
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greet Philadelphia.
"I still get goose look when I talk about it".
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as was foreseen in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulacles, which merge like the hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplogrous were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to borrow like a crowd", said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to become like a mass movement that shaped itself with Chelsea, like the movement, also behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing.
A nationwide human hunt has been underway for a professor at Northwestern University and a university employee at Oxford, who are considered suspects after a man was killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with lethal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) Arrest Wars were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the Act of the District Court of Appeal of Cook County.
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau, 26, after several Stichen verstarb.
A warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead on the spot of what happened, and Detective investigated the Stiche as murder, while the police actively searched for the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president for university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem has now been assessed and ruled out by the head of the Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman of the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and are willing to help US investigators in every possible way."
The statement added that Mr Warrens was shocked and wanted him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Agency, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge suspects to confront the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional, and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building age of the Grand-Plaza building that had just received a enigmatic tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were buildings.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship", said Guglielmi.
The management team at the Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researching a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident".
"We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Vice President Mutko Mutko
The Russian Vice President Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a certain stage of fulfilment of the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test the right to collaborate with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, "explained Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented the second part of the WADA roadmap to respect the code, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and recently published on the site of the organization.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give cause for concern to Russia.
"Everything was announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future ", he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to accept publicly the reported results of the investigation carried out by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: 'We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has acknowledged a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no public programmes, and we will not admit something that does not exist. '
Mutkos ’ words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems with the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody has to accept this report unconditionally, 'added Smirnov.
RUSADA was ruled out in November 2015 in the wake of the Doping scandal of WADA from conducting doping controls in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to Moscow ’ s headquarters in July, WADA ’ s Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to be reinstated.
Aldi does not sell eggs anymore.
The shared business groups.
It was a mere precaution that no health impairment could be expected to continue.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have demonstrably been tested in a negative way on fipronilable anti-Laettel.
Aldi wanted clarity and transparency in his customers.
The start-ups that will help your company will not become the next Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employee ’ s happiness at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
It has created people from outside to help.
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is on guard to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it enables companies to carry out surveys, to address specific groups and demographics groups, to offer anonymity and advertising hotlines, and, in some cases, whistleblowern to bypass C-Suite executives and turn directly to the board.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee commitment.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a hit card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can check why.
Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must stay, so that you will not be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation, and compliance could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, helps companies to prevent bad behavior and recognize, saw an increasing interest and activity early this year amid the Uber case in disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
As Glint, Convercent company can send tailor-made "Puls-" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found which treats its employees badly or acts ethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convercent has used more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way of achieving their core business.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company ’ s headquarters, a formal complaint was filed and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice.
"I can come closer to this holistic, 360-degree view in experience with employment", said Vitrano, who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders against employment disputes."
Businesses began to take ethics, values, and employee commitment in 2002, after the Book of Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden companies with recurring charges for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that is supported by Venture Capital investors, both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February by companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitcers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing research complex which shows that today's employees expect more jobs than they have done so far.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If the people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint..

If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase the commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on the employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take measures.
In fact, if a company asks for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn ’ t come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and cultivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International, the company has seen that have left very much on collecting data.
"For if you do not follow staff will ask," Have you really heard me?
Do you care about this?
And whom do you not care about why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys, was able to take measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so Savior.
And, following the gathering of feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company by the speed of decision making and quality of communication to address the problems.
With Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long term this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry that is known for high turnover.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the break.
It goes on at 23 o'clock, when a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the new practice team on the camp.
Some have removed their tricot parts and show the back full sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team this afternoon is an afternoon break.
Players who are enrolled during the summer courses will return to their final exam after the three-hour exercise before returning to the next morning at 6: 30 pm to the water man Football Center.
"This is for the guys the next three days a real tretmill", said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the player and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
For this reason, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the break moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playing times in Western wood practicing exercises.
They are supposed to be holding exercises during August 18, 20 before the formal preparations for their launch against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he support the rule change of the NCAA, even if it adds a further point to the busy routing of the player.
"We place this enormous burden three or four days on them, and it is very challenging", said Mora.
"And they simply pushed it through, they placken on, they are great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great. '
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, given the clear lines of its fields from a adjacent parking lot and adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been guarded with footballs, which will be a safety net behind a gate cost area, will not be an easy task.
Bruins-Spieler should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to draw an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I do not worry too much about that.
We have a plan. '
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against counterfeit news.
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false news to fact-reviewed third parties and their results below the original post then, said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday, and it is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible wrinkles and send them to fact-checking agents that may show results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distributional points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being overwhelmed in the run-up to the presidential elections in May with false stories, and Germany supports a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to eliminate hasty postings, as they did before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the US, France, the Netherlands, and Germany, a test of the new fact-checking will be launched.
"In addition to the knowledge which stories are challenged by fact-reviewed third parties, people want to make more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share", said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook-News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news.
Create a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a love for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years", he says weary.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand".
"A Castle in England" stretches from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney, each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly found emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jakobiner," he says.
"This is his thumb pressure!
And letters always smell after smoke, because at that time you breed a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were itself.
Ach, I love Archive! "
For someone who has been beaten with old papers, he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overvalued") this seems all too nice to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the montages of Hyänenköpfe on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape patrons, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only received full access in 2006, when the last inheritance, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, wires on the roof ".
Tagebücher, letters from the time of English empires, maps that show who owned what: "You could think that land conflicts would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought for the two families..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Young, let everything go its way! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader basis into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to rise from 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that appeared in 1380 at the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"The farm uprising began in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start.
Perhaps the two are connected? '
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit pater, the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed from the 18th century, who performed his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery made only years later when his sardines were buried).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: 'The lords seemed to be quite a palate, always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men redeemed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I see them as a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to advertise them ".
After the end of his work in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He has made a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorial dating back to the early 20th century, which has since been called back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like: "Ach, now I have to be finished again with the damned life".
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf.
With the contraception of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau of Thursday).
Until Thursday, mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team want Nelson Artz to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, the culmination of the campaign will be a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Or 'ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think this (of course)," they write on their website yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that manches are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we, as Bad Honnefer, know the beauty and attractiveness of our city very well. ".,,,,,,,,,,,,
The action is about more than just a logo and a slogan, that is.
"It is important to formulate a pledge which gives the city an unmistakable unique".
Finally, they are competing with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef will mark its new roof and the campaign costs.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army
Each year at the beginning of August, Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council (YAS) on retirement and promotions in officer corps.
This week too.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine for Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The sitting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as was the case earlier, but in the seat of the Prime Minister.
At the meetings, the Heads of Government chaired the five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and External Affairs.
This meant that the civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government attracts the reins in the military.
Generally, Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commander of the army, the air forces and the navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the Movement of Exil-Predigers Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a draftsman of the coup attempt.
For 486 people who were directly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating since this week.
Even on the day after the coup, Erdogan described the attempted coup as "God gift" because he gave him the opportunity to clean up the armed forces. "
But has Erdogan really managed the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the heading "Unbehagen im Militär-Hauptquartier".
In general, there are concerns about an increasing 'Islamisation' of the army, which, among other things, wrote in the repeal of the head ban on solvents.
In any case, the great clean-up of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan, by decree, ordered another 7395 officers, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be the actual lords of the country.
Three-putted them under appeal to their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his 2002 election victory, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step backwards, not least in calling for the European Union's reform targets.
Former officers say that Erdogan is pushing for Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a notably non-officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt from fear of persecution abroad, warned the Turkish army in a few years' time "full of extremists and salafists".
If so, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts about the deployment of the Turkish army in the alliance after the purge.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "weakened", say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, cited by the media.
It envisages reducing the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family orientated visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and do so by changing the US way citizens are spent from other countries Green Cards."
The law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to sank for racetrack huttle.
Over the past few months, the future of the racecourse huttles has always been a matter of urgency.
Before the end of the year, the route on which the tourist railway is to be built is to be completed.
In order to ensure the future of the racing platform huttles in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, this year works on the route.
"With the decision to continue to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this particularly important link for tourism", declared Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was about EUR 2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country takes 75%.
The Treaty, on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the country, will be finalised, declared sins.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are", said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be closed for a period of eleven years.
In order to ensure that the scheduled scheduled scheduled race start on December 2017.
The racetrack shuttle is a popular rail connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
Over the past few months, a pilot has been tested in the course of a pilot operation, whether the route is used by enough people to order it again in the future.
The route is also overdue in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry.
Just as you thought that 2017 could not be more crazy, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yes, indeed.
Sex-robots are now a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years., and.,,,,,,,,,
According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University, and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot, its shape of the chest and the type of fingernails.
"People make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report.
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - deliberately human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can adjust his robot according to his convictions "and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the chest waist to the type or color of his finger nails.
But it will be even more disturbing because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a step-ford-woman progressive look.
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix-Roboter allows users, for example, to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shutter speed.
And then there is the True Companion developed Roxxxxy Gold Sex-Roboter with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of intimidation and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible", blacks the site of True Companion.
So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you like, etc.
Over the course of the day you also have their votes - just like real people!
You can be tired, fixated on conversation, or you can be "in mood"!!!,,,,,,,,,
There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the subdued female characteristics, the allusion to rape when one goes a step on Frigid (i.e. here: resisting) Farrah, disturbing one most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxxy compared with a Vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) have a Vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" says it on the site.
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toys.
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as optional addition.
Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR keeps their growing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture.
But what can be learned from the fringe zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.
There is, however, a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots are emerging at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has irradiated women to be sexually assaulted.
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images that have disappeared and the body and the outgoing eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great jump.
The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn star-proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, at the point when it comes to their 'personalities', robots are not real women.
You cannot separate yourself from your pet or simply go away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation.
In other words, you are forged slaves.
Or to express it in 2017 ’ s redefinition: service powers
Trump ’ s great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.
It has become a trump card era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Erntedankfest in the US newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s selective relatives.
We are all supposed to have our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed is Trump ’ s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousine, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.
With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the Republican relatives, who fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
To be sure, the essence is a good thing, but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the unimaginable effect of his presidency has put us all on the right.
When we talk about 'normalization' and Trump, we refer to the gruesome possibility that his powers will one day no longer be shot.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump normalizes Republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appears to be the epitome of rationality in comparison with its standards.
I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urkomic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, which accounted for 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - both in comparison to Trump, in fact, are very mild offences.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousine was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of New York's carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarce and the animals are twisted to look at their own shoulders - extremely finster and the climatic music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not entirely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - but a great circular traffic in the north of London.
The Central Park-Carousel, however, is still a strange magical experience, because here two years old, an 11-year old and two women in the 40-year period can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, I was forced in a department house this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to make an assessment with a 15% tip - to buy something about the charge.
This does not only lead to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring in a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the department house stood firm grinsend, while I tired the experience made her credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison moved to hospital.
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his hand, which he suffered from the prison authorities following a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine ’ s 2013, several times by putting a door to the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night intrusion that hid in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to South Africa at the Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his penalty will be increased for 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As a Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg.
As the last blower of schools, the Viertklässler were made redundant from Fützen and Epfenhofen during the holidays and the secondary schools.
Three of the students of the school go to Gymnasium in the future, four to the Realschule.
Schulleiterin Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of school dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken, but then becomes dismissed in freedom.
This led to the muntere Schar a musical called "The Adler in the chicken of".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it erupt from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken dress, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning his chicken out of him was that the eagle spread to a high mountain his wings and determined.
After that, the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance.
The stalls danced with the young gockles, the cylinders trugen to bet.
Adler stands for integration, said teacher Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks) but belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His provision is to be free.
She wanted every quarter-clan that he feels accepted in his new school.
It followed the words of thanks to the former head of school Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in class passports, and the parental representatives.
The chicken time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
They leave their students after two years of teaching very unjust because it was a really great time.
Finally, they can rely on the quarter-hunters.
To conclude, all students have a song of summer time and holiday time.
This was a great pleasure for children.
For the new school year, eight first-class students are already registered.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted on television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal people was arrested in Sithonia by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released, while currently an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported TV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have stepped up control of the free camps and have found anyone who will remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose, substantial fines.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software Update for diesel vehicles: What those affected must now know is what they need to know.
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emissions behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and in part EUR 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have the debris software", says Anja Smetanin.
Deren Nachrüstung has ordered the Federal Forces Office (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but they have not yet mentioned a precise date.
Daimler has communicated to anyone concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within the framework of this.
How long will the retrofitting process take?
"Sword to say" means Smetanin.
This depends on the manufacturer ’ s commitment and political pressure.
"Because we have seen voluntary action by car manufacturers on the environment so far not."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
Time consuming could be to get an appointment.
What do car drivers do not make a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE rät to wait.
Suddenly, foreign producers would follow, so Smetanin.
Is there a massive fall in prices of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
But in the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE rät, with a sale still waiting.
LL Cool J gets Kennedy Center award.
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive a prestigious Kennedy Center awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also saw Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be given at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and, together with his wife Melania, will attend the ceremony.
The prize-winner Lear announced with progressive TV series that he had already announced that he would not participate in the gala.
"The New York Times" said: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and this strains me".
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.
The Kennedy named Kennedy after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the City Life Value
Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, is going to retire next year.
The job is already advertised - suitable applicants are rar.
Since 31 years Wacker has been mayor of the city.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he communicates in the press interview.
He reports of varied but also challenging tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, it is surprising that no application has been made to date.
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the earliest possible time.
In this way, the observance of the regular termination periods should be enough time for a review.
Since Haslach acts as a subcontractor for the administrative community as a civil construction authority, the applicant must have appropriate qualifications.
For this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they could no longer fill them out, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg.
But proximity to the city, and even important to him, Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some major projects have accumulated, looking back on the Wacker with pride.
"We make the city life-value", he is safe about the construction office and its staff.
But also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatzes, for example, have been employed.
The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium rehabilitation is still a topic.
The latter alone will beat about EUR 1.5 million to book if we are 'right', estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here makes fun. "
There is plenty of room for a city builder.
With Haslach ’ s own building yard and gardening, it is possible to react flexibly to many things.
"You can move a lot", so Wacker, and the design of the green plants is mentioned by citizens and visitors often praising.
As the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to have an eye for what fits "if new buildings are approved, emphasizing the outgoing mayor of the city.
In any case, the mayor bears high responsibility.
He is a builder, "at the end everything runs here about my table".
With care and coordination he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been present for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Also that his successor stays long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified with the place and want to stay".
For continuity is important not only for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to rent Roland Wacker, you should have access to the city of Haslach as a diploma engineer or Bachelor of Architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and construction law.
The Stadtbauamt underlines high and lowland construction, construction planning, basic occupational matters, administration of urban properties, urban works farm with the building yard and municipal gardens as well as subbuilding rights authority including monument protection.
Cycling on wires: Southern railway route closed.
According to the police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had the blue bicycle from the railway track track in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for night hours.
Close to the Tatort were seen by witnesses a rosaroter scooter and a bicycle driver was observed.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich", said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch to APA.
The perpetrators or the perpetrators themselves would have been put at great risk and would also jeopardise rail transport.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and plant as well as the delays and costs of rail replacement, Pönalen could also be found on the train customers.
All in all, from a 'substantial' sum, the speaker said.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, rail transport on the South Railway route could not be carried out without disabilities.
Almost ten people were excluded from the Friday morning, two of them concerned long-distance traffic.
freight trains did not fall, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of pipelines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory intestine disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat based protein and dairy products could reduce the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The incurable state in which the US accounts for around 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes gastric shrinkage and leaves, recurring or bloody diarrhea, loss of weight and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote tolerant intestines.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immunization cells in the intestine are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory disease.
In experiments, it has been established that a kind of tolerance of stimulant cells occurs in mice, which carry a particular bacterium in its input.
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells.
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a drug-tophan rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory Darmmilieus promotes if the same system also affects people.
The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immunization that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been housed separately, had not.
She suspected that the difference with the intestinal robioms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The dams of the mice were DNA sequences and six bacteria found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them they lacked the mice.
Moravians were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a Darmmikrobiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grew in a fluid and then transferred small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed to tolerate cells.
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan metabolism known as Indol 3 milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50%, but when the Tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans like mice, but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells breed inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high Tryptophanwerte can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic.
In Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genius", Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last season game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marschierten.
However, Matic was excluded from the preparation Asia-Tournee of the Blues and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admits that he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium, as Mourinho his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho had three other new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job", three of his four priority new commitments.
"Three of four to get, thank the association," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four of them for me, but they have taken great trouble."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliners in the sky.
The pilot flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington, which began drawing but moved to Marquette in the U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliners over the US, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens the form of a Dreamliner was to be.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier.
Thus the number "787" and the signature logo was painted in the sky.
Neuer Tiefschlag für Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem.
As the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, social democratic prime ministers looked forward to elections with some concern to Berlin.
Bloss is not a disorder from the party ’ s central, merely a headwind from the federal – so loudly the most important desire of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz, the party has changed radically.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus are observing the events in the SPD governed state capitals.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with headwinds.
It was deep strikes.
And one after another.
The Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the rot-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once more: Rot-Grün can simply not reliably govern", said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber the German editorial network (RND).
The surprising group outbreak of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country ’ s election, his red green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The CDU overcomes a clear falsification of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must return her mandate immediately, "said the Federal Managing Director and Election Director of the Green RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
"This must not be true," he is fighting for a SPD campaign, when the new Hiobsbotschaft reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the supremacy of the green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD provinces.
And no one knows what comes next.
The plight began with the unexpected defeat at the March Saarland election.
A blue eye, no more reassured the comrades at the time.
After the country elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It was then - and everything was much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln, the Dusseldorf Pleite haute the party smooth.
Carefully, the comrades in the weeks after that were coming back.
Then when they had just had the new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg came.
And with him came the next deep strike.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus at that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie, while his city burned.
And because he was so wrong in crisis communication about everything that could be wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW-Abgasaffäre and its role in the supervisory board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been criticising for a long time.
Miese surveyed were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely precisely because in the last few weeks, more and more attempts to accentuate the covenant.
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden in the context of Martin Schulz.
They left him because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because of the fact that the Anglo-Saxon Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance is in fact not guilty of internal stri.
And Schulz is not at all.
Sometimes the comrades try to keep their own rows closed.
Your anger is directed at the Greens, and here especially at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democratic, as Mrs Twesten puts her own careers over the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Bundestagsfraktion, the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the national list of the Lower Saxon Green Members.
The logical consequence would be that it gives its mandate back.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestagsfraktion, laments a "undemocratic maneuver".
"The popular will four years ago was clear: people have made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the lower Saxon SPD as a top candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now, the personal career memory of a future CDU member falsifies the election result," said Oppermann.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or more commitments from the CDU.
Grants for Places III
Anyone who wants to renovate his house in the years may soon receive support from the country.
In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung were informed on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again presented a retrospective of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I took over from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the total funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
For Schindler, the existing remediations are a "success project" - it is important to promote internal development, not only to open up new building areas.
On 4 April, you received the information from the government Bureau Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area.
The amount of support amounted to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 were received by the country, the rest of the municipality.
How will a rehabilitation area be created?
We will continue to investigate Schindler, where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial borders could be deferred again.
The STEG contracted at the Mittwochabend Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder-Programm "Soziale Stadt", in which the rehabilitation would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be object-related, that is, per plot.
Finally, the rehabilitation area would be defined as a statute.
The authorization period for funding has expired since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory will only be carried out once again, in the context of which the participants in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire on filling out..
In November or December, the decision on saturation is to be made as soon as possible, so that it can begin with the remedies next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that every commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing and deciding on the extent to which urban planning will be restructured.
It will then be registered in the basic book for the property.
Pietzschmann will come back to Empfingen and get a picture of the situation, promised it.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be able to be filled out by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arch", where it is concerned, among other things, the construction state and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the 'budgetary and housing bows', information on size, distribution and residents of a living room can be made.
The blue "operating bogs" is only to be filled when operating in the premises.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.
Moreover, rebuilding measures are not eligible.
Schindler pointed out that the distribution of the funding according to the 'greyhound principle' works - who comes first, first exhorts.
You cannot reserve any funding for later ".
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make the attendant a rehabilitation "tasty".
British inventors are themselves using a microchip to get to a mobile movement in house and car.
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a mobile movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between Daumen and Zeigefinger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by its company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant to the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cats and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks to houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now grown both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands of thousands of thousands of euros.
The decision of the White House to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers according to the military data that were left to TIME magazine until US $24,000.
The green white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
In addition to a yacht from Maine, the helicopter was issued in Connecticut, a fire-fighting car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility", wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superiors, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn on 17 July at 7 a.m. for the event at 15 p.m., and so long remained until the grid between 18: 00 and 21: 00 was cleared this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight.
The original crew was on the ground during the helicopter event, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers using state property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Klingt, as if you were locked," said the deputy commander.
The "Made in America" event was referred to by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave an impetus to the reform of health reform that was under way in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But their use only for a photo OP is unusual.
Trump conducted a study in February, when his first campaign rally took place in Melbourne, Florida, Taxidienste, and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors.
"The White House is thrilled by the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states, produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Secretary of the press of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX 1 crews often carry training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to set the US President in White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 in the White House led 58 exercises.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted on the training needs of the crew for the month, said a civil servant.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on this day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayer did not present the burden for any of the other requirements presented at the event.
A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in issuing helicopters on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 has no budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to US Department of Defense ’ s hourly tariffs for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour.
The flight time of the aircraft is recorded as 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
"The cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the initial rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion.
At this time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present these week things that are made in America", said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people, depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this. '
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he viewed his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he set himself up in the driver ’ s seat of a firefighter.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and cheered with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss in front of kniffing task
Top runners of the Second Tennis League are joining the third search team at SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third search village SV.
Despite five particles, the top runner of the second tennis league still has a sense of reality.
Teamchef Marius Zay certainly has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formations.
It is precisely on the back positions that I find the team very good. ".
For class and stability in the search dorfer SV, especially imports from the high north.
"Deren Danes and Finns can even refer to kits in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the double ", says Zay with view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"This will always be difficult for us.
You also need a good portion of luck here.
The newer team for the trip in the high north is practically in use.
His debut for Blue White could give Maxime Janvier.
At the moment, the Italian Biella Tournament will not be the Bundesliga-Partie, which will be used in the Czech Liberec Tournament (Czech Republic) during the first season.
The hitherto unwon Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the White Russian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel am Ball.
He should be in Kiel as well as his Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could once again join the team.
It was not enough for the 18-year-olds Hungarians, who in January 2016 were the number one in the junior world ranking, to fill someone from the trainer at Marius Zay the Kader.
How America of OMV can harm
Really happy, Donald Trump did not act as Mittwochabend his signature under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his hate to enact the law," Congress has wrapped a few "unconstitutional rules", he estimated.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of US push.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines in the EU.
Accordingly, since then, investors of the domestic OMV, which together with other European companies, are co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea ice Nord Stream 2.
Drohkulisse is violent..
Nevertheless, it is too early to assess the consequences, the official statement of the oil company.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would have to revive the sanctions by executive order.
Twelve weapons are in the process of choosing them..
"The press" has looked at what the Group could defend itself and what it could really hurt.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar the Cali Cartel in the Hitreihe of Netflix will be placed at the center of the game.
Despite the second season of Narcos, the Pablo Escobars Killer is revealed, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The stage three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest floors of the show.
With the third season, DEA has focused its attention on the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali-Kartell.
Guided by four powerful patrons, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) command the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city has 46 kitchen aids.
The city organizes the Kita Lunch again.
With fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban day-care centre.
On September 1, Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban nursery facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Director in the Department of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We have all been very pleased".
Gekocht will continue to stay out of house: A caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 nursery days in the Krefeld area, 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the last kitajahr there are 2800 children at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week are explained in the Kita to lunch", explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour fee if children stay until 14 pm".
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service from 1 September: you will be warming up the dishes delivered, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, and you will be able to put the meal in your own room, wash and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are assigned a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven group groups - decides on the hourly range.
"The kitchens now belong to the Kita-Team", says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for Kitaleitung to implement pedagogical concepts".
It is also a question of healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help to prepare food".
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Also for children.
"You have a known force in the kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also highlighted the charm of the kitchen performance, which is compared to the cost of self-governing and external procurement for the city as the most economical, i.e. from the press office.
And, while 46 part-time workers are being reset.
"But these hours are not so strong in the field of education," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN.
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, President-in-Office of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will stand in the provinces in the Council elections, and three women will stand for the role of Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, the elections for the first time will pass power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to eradicate 13-year-old girls.
Two young men at the age of 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to deprive a 13-year-old girl.
According to information from the police, the men told the 13-year-olds who met with friends at the Kolpingstraße, at 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to telephone with the mobile phone of the girl.
The 13-year-old rejected the request, but went on with her friends.
After that, one of the dancers tried to attack the cellular phone and the neck of the girl, which for some time failed.
Without prey, the Duo fled.
The two young men could be arrested later by the police.
The investigations are under way.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to reassure Managern of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production in her factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company had sworn over the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the plant, which, besides other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be the first to know if their activities were changed.
In a letter to the subsidiary manager of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie's called for 'concerns to be expressed that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being promoted'.
GMB seniors organizer Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we do not need clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force is focusing heavily on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie.
A spokesman in Pladis said: "The Filialleiter at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our operations - and this applies to all our business areas and sites - to remain competitive.
In addition, in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site and if our operations change at the site, employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this.
Has the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago about Neymar?
The site of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not be able to follow Neymar ’ s persecution after making an offer of £189 million to resolve his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago against the World Record?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, because Ligue 1-Klub is ready to break the world record more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to the last season for £89 million to Manchester United.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 a week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan Executive Board is insisting that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president against this prospect?
When Manchester City declared interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign up to one of our players, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish Association at the beginning of this summer expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.

Interview: "Domspatzen-Report entlastet Papst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of papal brother Georg Ratzinger.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are church", explained after publication to the German press agency, he expects the former Regensburger Bischof and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerite Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.
It would serve the image of the Catholic Church very if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their misjudgments at the time.
The Vatican chancellor "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the fact that, when reporting on violence in the domain, "double standards" were applied.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubt that it is' shameful and shameful deeds' that should be punished and prevented in the future; conspicuously, however, the 'degree of media manipulation', the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal", writes Scaraffia.
Also Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis meinte im Interview mit dem Bayerische Rundfunk: "Man geht gerne auf die Kirche los und das ist ein gefundenes Fressen".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth 'hockey was a very normal pedagogical means' to deal with french children, as I was one. '
It would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuse cases, Pope George Ratzinger often appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote "My brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger, is completely wrong.
"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him", he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment Attorney Ulrich Weber?
In total, 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were exploited between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 domains of sexual abuse.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg, states: "To sum up, it is clear that in many cases cases cases of physical and mental violence have been applied.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe.
Despite this, unlike many other defendants, many victims are appalled by the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him, despite violence.
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger took his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the 'incidents of violence in Schutzbefohlenen near the Regensburger Domspatzen' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students raise his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist, who has become more familiar when a dome musically did not deliver top performance.
How do you consider his biograph to be this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger comes at all.
He has just been devoted to eight pages, and he is clearly spoken of every suspicion of complicity or co-existence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the pre-school also took place outside its sphere of action.
It is possible to accuse him of being too late or of not taking the first suggestions seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he acted, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes him as a "warm hearty", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understandable", as an extremely good teacher who regularly contaminated young people with cakes, biscuits and bons, and "always killed by grapes of children".
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to anger once again.
The fact that he did not only deal with stools and threw the key bund on the ground, but also gave Ohrfeigen distributed and all too french guys to the hair or ears, he himself has already admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologises for this.
In his honor rescue, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960 ’ s, and 1970 ’ s, among parents as well as teachers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do you know about such ignition methods?
Of course, I think everyone of us born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
Compared to what this report is actually about, that is, the appalling sexual abuse and the violence at the pre-school school, these are, of course, bagatells.
As one wonders whether it is not related to his popularity and role as brother of Benedikt XVI. that many media crashed on him.
On the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him still work diligently.
The truth is, however, that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a lot has been reported on the subject of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen report.
Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report include any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: No.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have trusted the master of the domain.
Not even the parents were greeted.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said a rugged deputy for the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me".
The real problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse has been, and yet most of the victims remain silent.
If they did not even trust parents and siblings, they certainly did not appoint a choir, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do I assess the role of Domspatzen students in terms of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student put it as follows: "As far as sexual abuse is concerned... I do not see a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had early insights and could have stopped the respective perpetrators.
I also think it is absurd to assume that it is more urgent or clearer, or rather opened up, than to their parents, boarding teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
Thus the report comes to the very clear conclusion: 'The fact that the student concerned and / or their environment were able to be confirmed within the framework of the investigation'.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is, therefore, entitled to be released by everyone.
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented or notified him.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these crimes in foreign affairs, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media much was read by "Gewaltexzessen" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Georg Ratzinger's former master of the Domkapellmeister will look at the "Wegschauen" report.
Do he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything is missing in the coverage and has become a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is precisely what is in turn an abuse of the report.
After all, it is kept clean: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Cathedral Treasures, between sexual abuse and the violence of texzessen and, let us say, other allegations.
Moreover, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a chorus leader of the Cathedral Treasury.
The whole terrible caning education, the cases in which Knaben of sadistic teachers were quite harassed and maligned, including horrific, occurred all along at the preschool school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous states have to have ruled.
But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with, for he got the boy to face only when they were already on the cathedral treasure barrier.
On that, as most witnesses stress, the theme "Preview" was taboo.
They were only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradietic" conditions.
What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: While there was discipline, there was no sadistic violence.
And that is also true of Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that 'many victims share the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, positive memories of him'.
At most, the charge remains to be reproached.
But, despite all the efforts, the report could only define two timescales in which it was reported by the states on the pillar.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was not responsible for the events at a school where he was not really responsible (so the witness), wanted to hear nothing, and then only back in 1993.
Would Georg Ratzinger be consistent with the circumstances?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which even reproduced the report.
In this report, he points out that the practice of caning continues to be practised.
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when caning was also banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as everyone knows.
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permitted limit had been exceeded.
But you cannot say that he would always have looked away.
That is simply not true.
In 1980, caning was officially abolished at schools in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards at the time.
How do you see this?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "pitfalls of anachronism", i.e. the danger of judging past moral standards.
The princess is right here.
But that does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was in the pre-school school of warmth and violence against innocent children, which has already gone far beyond what was then common practice.
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked up.
At the same time, however, I must take Georg Ratzinger's protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, earcowardly, and hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, it was strictly adhered to.
What image of his Regensburger Zeit has Georg Ratzinger given in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?
Kam the subject of caning also serves the language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the insistence of unconditional discipline, it would not have been possible for him to form a world class institution, a true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition, which was twice the same in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With Keksen and Bonbons alone, you don ’ t even make big singers and before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming.
What kind of people have you experienced as Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep believers and heartfelt people who cannot imagine that he could only do something to fly.
I get regular contact with how many former treasures still today, 23 years after his Emeritization, keep in contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
Those who do not grant him until today that he was too strict to them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the domains are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music closer to them.
And that he may always be a good, fathery teacher - a strict father, certainly, but he was also a loving man of respect, who is still standing up to them today, and who actually honour them.
And I would ask you once again to make it quite clear that everything you are accustomed to is educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.
That is the evil intention behind it, all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves it.
Now, the decency area, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits, and perhaps not yet familiar with the Bavarian and perhaps even Germany, would not be able to let anyone know the Regensburger Domspatzen.
