Losses in the Bundeswehr : Machine guns disappear without trace .	-3.1988
Friday , 27 September 2019	-0.9440
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared .	-1.8864
In recent years , the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shot munitions , including three machine guns , most of which are unclear , and the opposition speaks of a ' ' scale .	-5.9917
The German Federal Armed Forces are constantly disappearing from weapons and ammunition - many of which have been without trace so far - and since early 2014 , the force has been recording the loss of 39 weapons , 39 arms parts and almost 20,000 guns , from a conspiracy listing of the Federal Defense Ministry , which the German editorial network reports .	-10.6749
According to the paper from the Office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU , two weapons , a gun and 3474 gun munitions have been recovered .	-6.7328
The amount of loss of weapons and ammunition in the German Armed Forces was " frightening " , said Martina Renner , a member of the Linken-Bundestag , all the more so because , in the course of investigations , little was found again .	-9.0985
Oil tanker " Stena Impero " left Iranian port .	-1.8798
More than two months after his appointment by the Iranian authorities , the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas this Friday .	-4.1685
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian Government on Monday , but it remained in Iranian waters initially , and the shipping company said that it wanted to wait for an official certificate from Tehran .	-5.8701
On 19 July , the " Stena Impero " was raised by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Hormuz Sea Road under the charge of violating security rules , but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary arrest of an Iranian oil tanker before the British Gibraltar .	-7.0304

Musk aspires to extradition records	-2.9676
Tesla ’ s quarter may hold record levels , but despite the extradition boom , there have been recent losses in the electric car company .	-6.6430
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk gave a strong boost to his electric car company with the prospect of new record numbers . " We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries , " Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek " .	-6.4135
The demand was strong , so Tesla could buy 110000 orders , and Musk ’ s circular letter continued . The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the clientele , with Tesla having to provide as many resources as possible to the quarterly .	-9.2251
In the second quarter , Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars , reaching its previous peak .	-6.5434
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals , with a total of 360000 to 400000 cars delivered in 2019 , with six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter , and the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand , but the profit margins are low , and despite the boom , losses .	-9.5252
To solve puzzles : that is why we cannot cheat ourselves .	-5.8698
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from kitting themselves , as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments at rats , as they announced on Thursday evening , and progress has been made on why children are so fiercely opposed to the kite , only to demand more .	-9.6357
After all , it has also been shown why the sewing of a kitting hand solves laughing even before touching , lying on a deep layer in the larch , which already solves the laughter while waiting for the kitten .	-9.7609
According to previous research , rats with " laughter " in the ultrasound area react when they are cooked by humans , and this " lau" is mediated by the part of that serves the processing .	-11.1372
Laughter is suppressed during self-contact .	-2.2586
It has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and contact by others - that is , people cannot cheat themselves , but the researchers of Berlin found out in the experiments at the rats that laughter , as well as the activity of the area in question , is suppressed during a self-touch , even if living creatures clean themselves .	-10.9551
However , if the self touch and the touch of others are suppressed at the same time , the laughter is also suppressed , suggesting that the brain of the rats cannot distinguish between self-touch and touch by others .	-14.8126
In addition , the rats have been trained to cheat themselves , thus sometimes prematurely abandoning this initiation in the experiment , showing escape behaviour or shrinking .	-10.1798

Iran Free British Tankers	-1.3735
The UN General Debate did not resolve the conflict in Iran , but now there is a problem less , and the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " , which is being held in Iran , could be a puzzle in the Iranian President ’ s peace plan .	-7.6572
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " , held in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July , is back in international waters .	-4.7501
The " Stena Impero " left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now travelling to Dubai for medical examinations , explained Reedereichef Erik Hånell .	-6.2912
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the establishment of the ship as illegal . ' This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas , and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law , ' said a communication on Friday .	-6.5055
On 19 July , the Iranian Revolutionary Guards set the tanker under the charge of flouting the provisions of the Persian Gulf Law , and seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September , and the remaining 16 crew members were doing the right thing , as Hånell said , in the face of the difficult and exciting situation in the last ten weeks , working to bring them back together with their families as quickly as possible .	-10.2440
The British Government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar following the establishment of the ' Stena Impero ' , where a supertanker with oil from Iran , intended for Syria , had been put on the chain at the beginning of July , and the authorities said that they were against EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria and that the British had received the reference to the ship from the United States .	-10.2486
Iran spoke of ' piracy ' and threatened with consequences ; in mid-August , the ' Adrian Darya-1 ' was finally released , with suspicions that it was a bargaining deal to get to the ' ' Stena Impero ' , London refused .	-6.9550
The road from Hormus is one of the world ’ s most important maritime routes , linking the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean , and much of the world ’ s exports of oil are shipped by the straits ; tensions in the region have worsened enormously in recent months , with trade shipping being dragged into conflict between the US and Iran , with several incidents involving tankers and drones .	-8.1005
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries , with Americans accusing Iran of building nuclear weapons , and Iran rejecting it ; the US unilaterally abandoned the international nuclear agreement in 2018 , which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb , while ending its political and economic isolation ; and , since then , the US government has put pressure on the Tehran government to impose a tougher and broader deal on other areas .	-10.1830
Because of the dispute over the " Stena Impero " and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia , the US is working on a coalition for military protection of trade vessels in the region .	-4.1183
At the UN General Assembly in New York , Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus , with the initiative ' Coalition of Hope ' for the Persian Gulf , Iran , along with the Arab Gulf states , and without foreign protective powers , ensuring the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf .	-6.5108
India , with its protectionist economic policies , is building a better future .	-2.5592
India would be predestined for the " war profiteer " ; given America 's punitive tariffs imposed on Chinese producers by US President Donald Trump , foreign producers in the People 's Republic are forced to reschedule Asian firms that are considering moving their production from China to another country , India is calling itself one of the preferred alternatives in a survey by the UBS , which , however , has nothing to do with the vagaries of the Sino-American trade war .	-9.3478
But now India itself has come under Trump ’ s focus ; from the White House ’ s “ Kingdom of Tariffs , ” in early June , America removed trade preferences for 2000 products from the emerging market . The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods , mobile phones , spirits , motorcycles , and .	-8.2237
On the world map of trade wars , however , the frictions with India are merely a sideshow , and America also views the world ’ s largest democracy through the security spectacle , with Delhi and Washington uniting concerns about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean , with a Salve of American punitive tariffs on India unlikely . India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who has just assumed a second five-year term , is likely to be safe .	-9.2594
The problem , however , lies elsewhere : the empirical assertion that open markets are accelerating economic development has a grave state in the Socialist Republic of India , even under Modi ’ s reform zeal is aimed mainly at the bureaucratic madness that has stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long . Companies are now receiving faster building permits for construction ; they benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure ; and a more grip insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for bankruptcy to liquidate firms with false debts .	-14.7366
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings , and India ’ s economic optics have won much for the better in the first five modes years , but trade policy does not have that in place to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers , even erected new barriers to the National Conservative government .	-9.0120
In the West , Modi of the Nimbus of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country economically , owing not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like . At the heart , however , the “ India First ” Advocate never depends on protectionist economic policies , which prevents Indian firms from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition , thanks to the deportation of their industries , including tribal electors of Modi Bharata and Janata Party .	-9.5291

" I just wanted to help him ; everyone in this situation would have done the same , " said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone , when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists .	-5.9706
He did so at the end of the evening - and much more intensively than he would have thought - because this heroism will be remembered , and , with Dabo , his competitor , Busby , even allowed him to go ahead and voluntarily took the last place - well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega , who won this race , it had nothing to do with it at the end , because the coach , which was only made with much help , was disqualified by the World Equality Association at the end of the day .	-15.3949
Dabo , who lives in Portugal and is studying in Lisbon , was present at the World Cup in Doha to set a personal record time , which , according to official data , was 18 : 10.87 minutes , but he himself was disappointed : " I wanted to run 17 : 55 minutes .	-13.0393
Millionenmasch : Egyptians are preparing for a wild day of protest .	-3.6346
In Egypt , security measures have been reinforced in the run-up to possible anti-government protests , with a reinforced police presence in the center of Cairo on Friday , with several underground stations closed , streets closed to central Tahrir Square .	-7.2231
In the past few days , the police had strengthened their street controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians were partially searched for news and photos related to the protests , and hundreds were arrested according to two non-governmental organisations .	-7.6054
Opponents of Al-Sisi	-1.2514
Last weekend , in Cairo , Alexandria , Suez , and Mansura , hundreds of participants were protesting against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ’ s government , which criticized corruption and mismanagement , an open protest against political leaders in Egypt for years .	-6.5744
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms ( ECRF ) has recorded more than 1,570 arrests by Friday , and the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights ( ECESR ) and Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) have said that more than 2,000 arrests have not been confirmed .	-5.8936

Online retailers : Mailers should be able to donate returns easier .	-5.1247
For online retailers , many returned packages have been lost , and around 20 million returns have been dumped , but there is an alternative .	-7.3910
The Treasury has shown online traders like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them .	-3.2725
While companies could not be exempted from VAT on contributions , the ministry explained on a matter of the Green German Parliament , about which the newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday , the traders could set the market value of unsold returns so low that they would not have to pay a turnover tax or little .	-10.9709
Researchers at the University of Bamberg found that , when ordering on the Internet , German citizens sent back each sixth package , and around four per cent of the goods - some 20 million products - then landed in the rubbish and , according to the current legal situation , they would cost additional money , because the financial authorities assess contributions such as sales , which would then incur VAT .	-11.5433

The work was first exhibited in the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of Britain , where Banksy lives , and this year the artist had re-exhibited the painting - simultaneously with the original Brexit date on March 29 .	-6.5042
The image could change the owner for one million days .	-3.4320
Finally , at the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday , following a forced break by the Supreme Court by Johnson , Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard swap with the opposition , and Johnson wants to make the Brexit that had already been postponed twice on October 31 , if necessary without an agreement with the EU .	-9.3955
It is not the first time that Banksy , whose identity is still unknown , interferes in the Brexit debate ; in Dover in the south-east of England , he painted an image that is a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a mosquito , with thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom every day .	-6.8189
Brexit debate is like a " walk in the park "	-2.3033
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson 's violent attacks on Brexiteers in Parliament do not , according to his top adviser , contribute to a climate of hatred ; compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum , the current controversy was a " walk in the park , " said Dominic Cummings on Friday when he made a booking . " We will enjoy it , we will be out of the EU and " .	-11.7298
Johnson had attacked Brexiteers hard in Parliament in recent days , and accused them , among other things , of " betrayal " on the people , alleging that he could endanger MEPs because they could be targeted at death threats , he did so as a " humbug . "	-9.1573
Cummings said that the only way to get calm again is for MEPs to finally respect the British decision to leave the EU , and it is not surprising that people were told that Britain was still not out of the EU three years after the referendum .	-6.0037

Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister , Khan , is calling for undo intervention in Kashmir	-2.4992
With an emotional appeal , Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the United Nations General Assembly .	-4.3962
Otherwise , a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely , Khan said on Friday during the Uno General debate in New York . " If that is going badly , one hopes for the best , but is prepared for the worst " .	-18.4417
Since independence from British colonial rule in 1947 , India and Pakistan have waged three wars , two of them to separate the divided Kashmir region , and both nuclear powers each have a share of Kashmir , another part of which is China . In early August , India had removed the autonomous status of the Kashmir region , thereby dramatically increasing tensions relative to Pakistan .	-7.3754
Not even a bottle of water	-0.7256
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi .	-2.2358
The government is reacting with tough hands to the current protests in Egypt , firing ammunition on the population , and more than 2,000 detainees are joining the 60,000 political prisoners that are already there . Protesting in Egypt has never been safe , but since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013 , the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario like the times of the Arab Spring .	-7.8310
But one of the triggers of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation . Poverty , lack of prospects , and the feeling of being stifled by their own government are driving millions into the streets , and that is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control , no matter how tough it is against adversaries , and the situation has even deterior.	-7.5874
Since 2016 , the currency has lost more than half of its value , the inflation rate is 10 % ; anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide whom to finance : Nestlé , Coca-Cola , or the military , because the latter is not only responsible for oppression , but also the largest economic actor ; the military builds roads , houses , soccer stadiums , produces food , and much more ; it has been .

Tüv checks at the terminal : BER-Chef : No " showstopper " more for the main airport .	-5.4427
Two months have been tested to see if the complex system mesh works together with the BER-Brandschutz system .	-8.4635
After large-scale Tüv inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport , operators confirmed the planned opening in October of next year , which I am sure was said by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , Rainer Bretschneider , after a meeting of the Supervisory Board .	-6.5101
airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed audit , but also said that there are still flaws in the terminal . " We have many detailed topics , but we do not have a real showstopper " .	-17.8665
There are , however , indications that the temporary reserve is no longer likely to be too large , and the construction production display is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020 , which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning .	-8.1135
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables still need to be remedied , and the Tüv will look into them by February . ' In order to create the conditions for the commencement of the operation of the aircraft , intensive work must continue to be done to deal with the shortcomings ' , a written communication stated .	-10.0090
Lütke Daldrup said that , in many cases , there is a lack of evidence , not so much about new cables , but there is still no exemption for all the nozzles on which the cables hang , and the head of the airport expects this to be available by the end of the year .	-7.7413
In addition , fire protection at the transition to the train station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily , and the problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago , this time involving smoke killers , who are driving down a fire like a canvas , so that the smoke does not spread too far , and 36 engines have to be replaced , so there will be new attempts at hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year .	-11.6198
The airport 's opening in 2011 was expected to be delayed by problems with fire protection and other construction barriers and planning flaws .	-20.4067
Since passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then , those responsible are planning to expand the airport , which is why they are due to attend a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October , as announced by Chairman Bretschneider .	-5.8172
The airport company is now looking for two new managers : Finance Director Heike Fölster will change to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year , Human Resources Manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year , as Bretschneider said .	-18.5119

It is also the case that there is a significant risk factor in cardiovascular diseases , such as obesity , smoking and unhealthy nutrition , and that the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known .	-12.1760
At the moment , more than 4,000 of the roughly 20,000 relevant human genes are known to be possible pathogenic changes in DNA – so-called mutations – that would come from the clinic .	-7.6536
According to the initiators , the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention , detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders , heart weakness and heart attacks .	-5.3048
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation , Klaus-Michael Kühne ( 82 ) , also stressed that there was a firm desire to use the data for research into other diseases as well . , , the Clinof the Foundation in Davos , a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine , , the expert , into bioinformatics the expert .	-18.7712

According to UKE , the inheritance of a human being can be decrypted within 24 hours , and the real cost of this would be EUR 1300 ; the first gene sequencing worldwide , the results of which were published in 2001 , cost hundreds of millions of euros ; the study is due to start on 1 October ; all 9000 samples are to be analysed by the end of 2020 ; the first results are expected to be published in 2001 .	-9.3369
Nigerian police are freeing hundreds of abused boys .	-2.9768
In Nigeria , the police freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a coral attack , and after evidence from residents , the school in the North Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims , some of whom were minors , as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said . " The victims were abused , some of whom said they had been raped by their teachers .	-9.7242
The boys were detained on the pretext of being taught and " improved " in the Qur 'an ; indeed , the protégés were detained by their teachers under " most degrading and inhumane conditions " , Sabo said .	-7.4050
According to the figures , the Koran school has been in existence for some ten years , and the authorities have drawn attention to repeated irregularities in the institution , and the parents have been shocked to learn about the conditions in the Koran School , Sabo said that they had not been punished by the suffering of their children , and that the operator and six staff were arrested according to the police .	-10.8674

Football ' Signature not valid '	-2.4352
Jürgen Klopp , Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded the award .	-2.8985
With a gala in Milan , the Fifa World Football Association is the best player , the best player and the best coach of the year .	-5.2619
After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he had never voted for the World Cup election , other countries were accused of the Fifa . Egypt was not even judged – with a curious justification .	-6.7853
Much of the Fifa ’ s past years have proven to be anemic : the World Cup awards , dubious plans by its president , Gianni Infantino , the general behavior of various corrupt officials . But the Fifa World Cup election has not so far been suspected of running neatly - if one disregards the fact that the voting national trainers and national team capitals of member federations are often more likely to vote for sympathy than objectively .	-10.5678
But , after Nicaragua ’ s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all , further inconsistencies are emerging : Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account ; indeed , they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview .	-5.7273
The Fifa apologises to the effect that ' the signatures on the electoral forms have been issued in capital letters and have therefore not been valid ' , and that the Egyptian Association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer .	-7.7264
Sudans Trainer also amazes .	-3.6480
Although the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable , the Sudanese Association admits that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally judged : with Lionel Messi on place one , Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three .	-6.4294
Nicaragua 's captain Juan Barrera also had allegations : " Have not voted for the # TheBest2019 Awards , all the information on my voice is wrong , thank you " , he wrote , , , , , .	-10.4453
On Friday , the Association announced that it was right to vote , but of course it was not intended to do so .	-9.4663
The other cases have now been investigated by the Fifa , but it is emphasised that the electoral process has been supervised externally by the PriceWaterhouseCoopers consulting firm , and Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Cup election - and Jürgen Klopp World Champion of the Year .	-7.7448
Ukraine ’ s Affair : Ranghohe Republicans are in favor of official investigation .	-4.1396
Two senior Republicans have openly advocated an official investigation against US President and party friend Donald Trump . " I think the investigation is important , " the Republican governor of the US state , Vermont , Phil Scott , said . " Where this leads from here , the facts are determined , " he wants to know more about whistleblowers before taking action .	-21.9869
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine .	-8.4472
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the whistleblower-affair , few have shown unease , and Scott ’ s remarks are now a first sign in Trump ’ s party , with the moderate governor of Virginia repeatedly opposing Trump ’ s policies , such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules .	-7.7856
As another senior Republican , Charlie Baker , Governor of Massachusetts , also spoke in favour of the investigation . " It is a deeply disturbing situation , " Baker said . " The right course of action and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get it to the bottom . "	-6.6675
Scott and Baker , as governor of US states , formally did not have a say in the proceedings against Trump , which is decided in Congress , so their pronouncements are symbolically important , but the Republicans ’ first senators have also been critical of the situation . Mitt Romney , for example , who represents the state of Utah in the second parliamentary chamber , said that the case was " extremely disturbing , deeply disturbing " .	-11.9840
The affair could result in the launch of an impeachment proceedings against Trump , the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into it , alleging abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit .	-5.8342
There is no precise timetable for impeachment ; with the majority in the House of Representatives , the Democrats could push for so-called impeachment ; but the decision to effectively impeachment would be in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority ; so far , no US president has been dismissed by an impeachment procedure .	-13.2456
Was Folterer an Board of Racketes " Sea Watch " ?	-2.0043
Three men have been arrested in Sicily , they have been raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps .	-2.6540
The German captain Carola Rackete ( 31 ) was arrested in June after having illegally fired the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 Libyan refugees .	-4.7943
Now , new serious accusations are being made against rackets : three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps with the ' Sea-Watch 3 ' arrived in Italy ; the suspects have been caught in a detention centre in Messina ( Sicily ) after migrants had rediscovered their embarrassment in Italy . ' We cannot rule out that , , but we have no information on it , , ' Sea Watch ' , said Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency .	-9.6660
In mid-September , the police said that the suspects in the North African country were raped , tortured , and even murdered ; they were Muhammad C. ( 27 ) of Guinea , and the two Egyptians Hameda A. ( 26 ) and Mahmoud A ( 24 ) . " The migrants were systematically harassed and atrocities exposed - through repeated and constant physical violence , " said the communication .	-7.0584
NGO and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships . " We cannot scan who the people are , who come without passports , " said a newcomer , and torture is one of the main reasons why the people of Libya are fleeing , so it is quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships . " It is therefore very important that this is followed up " .	-8.6368
Italy ’ s right-wing former Minister of the Interior , Matteo Salvini , was immediately apologizing for the revenge against which Italy is still being investigated for aiding illegal immigration .	-6.1393
Musk aspires to extradition records at Tesla	-4.0868
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given a strong boost to his electric car company with the prospect of new record numbers .	-4.7059
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries " , Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek " .	-4.1221
The demand was strong , so that Tesla could buy 110,000 orders , and Musk ’ s circular letter continued . The challenge is to bring cars quickly to the clientele , with Tesla having to provide as many resources as possible to the quarterly .	-9.1635
In the second quarter , Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars , reaching its previous peak .	-6.2508
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals , with a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars delivered in 2019 , with six-figure figures in the current and next quarter-year , and the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand , but the profit margins are low , .	-9.2232
US budget dispute : Once again , only bridge-financing	-6.7970
The new financial year will start in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget , and the Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and adopted transitional financing until 21 November .	-5.0139
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to raise spending ceilings for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 , the United States will once again have no spending plans ahead of the new fiscal year starting on October 1 . The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and adopted a transitional financing ( Continuing Resolution , CR ) by November 21 , without which it would have come to a shutdown on Monday , a partial shutdown by the federal .	-7.6733
Shutdown	-1.7768
For the time being , the federal government is being funded at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019 , which ends on Monday , because Congress cannot agree on the 12 spending laws that allocate funds to the various departments and authorities , so the federal government cannot benefit from the $ 1.4 Bio for the new financial year .	-8.4855
The Democrats , in the House of Representatives , where they have the majority , have made ten of the twelve laws , but the spending laws reflect Democrats ’ priorities , which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate . Conversely , the Senate also has ten of the 12 spending plans more or less ready , which are barely multi-majority .	-7.4389
In the Senate , Republicans seem to be trying to impose $ 12 billion on the Wall , one of the major priorities of President Trump , and Democrats are bothering about the Wall plans and their financing , which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects .	-8.7604
At Mauerbau , the spirits divorce .	-3.6198
At the moment , it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue , and it is more likely that agreement on all twelve spending laws will be extended beyond 21 November in the next seven weeks , and a shutdown is not ruled out either .	-7.7971
In view of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the 12 spending laws in good time , and the associated risk of a shutdown , ideas are gaining in popularity to automate the process . Temporary p . 1877 to avoid Shutdowns , federal government financing would automatically continue at the same level as the previous year , discourage parliamentarians ’ travel , and withhold their wages , until the new annual spending plans .	-11.6984
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles	-5.4936
In France , artificial fertilization will continue to be open to all women and lesbians : the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that would allow all women to benefit from in-vitro fertilization , which is likely to increase demand for anonymous sperm pends .	-7.3066
In the three-day emotional debate , critics on the right had warned that in the future many " children without father " could grow up .	-5.8112
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that defended health minister Agnès Buzyn as an " opportunity " for society , and it is the modern family in which children with only one parent or homosexual parents are given the cost of artificial insemination for all women .	-8.0698
Breeding with sperm of dead husband further prohibited	-4.8055
By a narrow majority , the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would allow widows for artificial insemination access to the sperm of their dead man . In Belgium , Spain , and the United Kingdom , artificial insemination is " post-mortem " .	-6.5415
Many members of the governing La République en Marche ( The Republic on the Move , LREM ) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition opposed the artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner .	-23.6898
The initiators of the amendment , which has now failed , find it unfair that a widow can be fertilised in the future with the sperm of an unknown , but not with that of their own partner .	-6.5391
So far , artificial fertilization in France is permitted only to heterosexual couples who cannot testify to children , who must be married or live together for at least two years , and Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain banned .	-6.1106
In Germany , artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples , however , it is often difficult .	-3.5123
Climate compensation : calls for flights to Unis will become louder .	-5.9071
There is a lot of work going on in universities , and that is why the country wants to have a climate levy imposed on it in the future , and the rectors say that they have no money for it , but now they are under internal pressure .	-9.9054
The universities should also limit themselves to flying : photo : dpa / Julian Stratenschulte .	-5.5568
The debate on a climate levy on university and university flights postponed before the summer recess is getting off the ground again , and now the plans are being supported by the universities in a conference by the green black coalition .	-43.5948
Russia Recalls North Korean fishermen	-3.0137
According to the secret service FSB , the detainees were illegally caught in Russian waters and , ten days earlier , 161 fishermen were already detained from North Korea , when there was a shield between the border guards and the boat crew , with three Russians and a North Korean being injured , and the fisherman subsequently suffered serious injuries , but there were no injured this time .	-9.8743
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages , and North Korean fishermen have therefore travelled in Russian territorial waters , where Russia ’ s coastguard , according to its own data , is patrolling its marine biological resources .	-6.5029
30,000 octopus fish seized .	-3.4426
In the case of renewed controls , 30,000 octopus were discovered and confiscated on boats , and three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok .	-7.4158
Russia ’ s fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans this year , even after complaints by local entrepreneurs , with thousands of North Korean fishermen being temporarily arrested there this year .	-6.9645
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far East region of Primorje , Georgi Martynow , recently complained about high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen , who fished in Russia ’ s banned narrow-meshed synthetic nets , which would also take small creatures out of the sea , and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea , where they needed 200 years to be destroyed .	-12.9987
In future , only 18.000 : the US will lower the asylum ceiling .	-4.0709
The ' most generous nation in history ' : Donald Trump , here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House .	-2.6977
The richest country in the world is closing itself off against defenders : as the State Department in Washington has confirmed , the ceiling on the legal granting of refugees will be lowered further , and , in future , mainly threatened creditors and Iraqis will be granted asylum .	-9.4150
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees once again , and , in the economic year 2020 , which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020 , a maximum of 18,000 people are expected to be left in the country , as the US State Department has said .	-7.9206
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has drastically reduced the readiness for protection seekers from around the world in recent years , with far higher revenue limits being applied under Barack Obama ’ s predecessor government .	-6.7879
The target of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US Refugee Program was launched in 1980 , but the Department of Foreign Affairs described the US as " the most impoverished and generous nation in history , " a phrase that is strongly reminiscent of the incumbent US president 's language .	-7.8507
A " responsible handling " of refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild , Trump explained , but there is also massive criticism of his hard line in migration policy .	-6.6651
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to seal off , and to finance the construction of a border wall , Trump had imposed the national emergency ; whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear . Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially imminent impeachment . , , , , , , is . , , , , , ,	-11.7664
The US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future , according to the Foreign Office : people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country , thereby endangering it , as stated in the State Department statement .	-9.2410
The US wants people from this ' northern triangle ' of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries in particular , and it is against this background that the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico .	-6.4260

An Orange Utan female was transferred to the United States at the request of the Argentine justice system from the former Buenos Aires zoo , and the Sandra Zoo , born in Rostock in 1986 , granted the rights of a " non-human person " , so her release was mandatory .	-9.8522
As the 53 kilograms of heavy human activity are unable to adapt to life in the wilderness , they will live in the Center for Great Apes in Florida , where 21 other orang-utans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed , including " Bubbles " , formerly the pet of Popstar Michael Jackson , but in in Florida Sand, a quarantine in Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita , Canada .	-8.6005

Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy	-2.1775
For reasons of racist comments about football profile Juan Jesus of AS Rome , the association of the Italian capital imposed a life-long stadium ban on a fan .	-6.8534
The club reacted late on Thursday , noting the fan 's account at Instagram and the police , and never again allowing Roma supporters to visit a game of the club , the club wrote on Twitter .	-5.9189
Racism is a problem in Italian football , with Italian fans regularly scoring racist insults against black players of rival teams . ' We cannot have racism in society or in sport ; in Italy , the situation has not improved , and that is very serious .	-7.7166
However , there were also discussions among the supporters of Juventus Turin , and the Italian authorities have now banned 38 stranded supporters of record champions Juventus Turin from the stadium , and four of them are unlikely to enter the stadium for a ten-year period , and the police have informed them that bans will apply from four to seven years .	-10.7599

The Kakerlake : inspired by Kafka : Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel .	-2.3006
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit mess ? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable .	-3.5788
Inspired by Franz Kafka 's famous narrative , " The Relation " , the British author Ian McEwan ( 71 ) wrote a book on Brexit chaos in Britain .	-4.1340
The novel " The Kakerlake " ( Original : " The Cockroach " ) will be published in German on November 27 , informed Diogenes Verlag ( Zurich ) about the transformation of a man named " Jim Sams " , who was ignored or hated in his previous life , but is now the most powerful man in Britain .	-6.1281
McEwan was quoted as saying : ' If Parliament is closed , so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment , when ministers are shamelessly lying like the Soviet leaders when Brexiteers , in high positions , come up with the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do ; there is only one answer : ' .	-8.9039
In 1915 , Kafka 's first published narrative was written by Gregor Samsa , who wakes up one morning and sees himself " transformed into an enormous untargeted " , is gradually excluded from the family and society , and finally , " Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands in its head " , it was written by Diogenes Verlag .	-10.3050

Stocking Brexit negotiations : The danger of a no-deal remains acute .	-3.4096
In fact , Premier Boris Johnson had clearly set out : he will not give a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations , but what statements are perpetual in the polarizing British ; the recent ruling by the Supreme Court in Britain is like a sword of Damocles over the Blondschopf ; his suspension of Parliament to be able to hold his Brexit course down to the expiry date was annulled earlier this week ; and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to do so in the event of failed negotiations with the EU until 31 October , which had led to a prolongation of bilateral talks with Johnson , which had always been categorically ruled out .	-12.2875
Boris Johnson still considers Deal possible .	-2.2885
But the pressure does not seem to be noticeably over Johnson , who , when visiting a hospital , suggested that he would support an extension of the negotiations in the event of a non-agreement by the end of October :	-7.7418
Know , we will abide by the law .	-2.8121
At the same time , however , we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October .	-2.0468
And best with a deal , I am cautiously optimistic that this .	-3.6044
And the time is beginning to run out of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels , with the EU and British negotiators having time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without agreements for about six weeks , but the recent talks have not yet reached a breakthrough , and an agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine . If the British Prime Minister fails to do so , a new postponement of the exit date will come into force , but the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister ’ s words , fearing that Johnson could somehow a no-deal in the case of Brexit .	-11.7841

A call in Ukraine , and everything is broken , US President Donald Trump could actually face an impeachment procedure following the turbulent revelations of the past few days that Democrats want to examine it in the House as soon as possible , from weeks to a decision .	-6.9172
At the beginning of the scandal , the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj appears , and the accusation of whistleblowers , which has brought to the public the conversation out of concern for national security and democracy in the United States with his complaint , is monstrous : the President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize another country ’ s government ’ s influence on the 2020 election , using Ukraine ’ s dependence to blackmail , thereby forcing it to take action against a political opponent .	-11.1071
The core of this project is also to be found in the interview with Selenskyj , which has now been published , although it does not reflect the full text , but the telephone on 25 July is just an episode of a much larger story , in whose center , alongside Trump , stands above all his personal lawyer : Rudy Giuliani .	-8.7699
History starts in May 2019 , when the New York Times reports of Rudy Giuliani 's travel plans to Ukraine ; he wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj , and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate . ' We do not interfere in an election , we interfere in an investigation into what we have the right to do ' , he says , the newspaper .	-18.5365
The attorney and former New York mayor seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that were fixed on Trump ’ s 2016 counter-candidate : Hillary Clinton has conjured up with actors in Ukraine , critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia ’ s investigations in the US , but this charge was never taken seriously .	-7.9792
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will be so prominent on the phone with Selenskyj in July , with the version of Giulianis and the president : the former vice-president and currently promising Democratic presidential candidate , Joe Biden , pushed the former Obama administration ’ s Obama administration to dismiss the then Ukrainian general prosecutor , Viktor Schokin , to stop the gas-company investigation that he was responsible for .	-9.0401
In fact , when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Prosecutor should go , investigations against the gas company had already been completed , Hunter Biden had never been directly affected , and Schokin was also deeply accused of corrupt behavior , with the US government far from being the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal .	-8.7224

Will the UK government circumvent Brexit law ? Johnson retire ?	-4.6005
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is seeking ways to circumvent the recent law passed by Parliament against unregulated Brexit , and he simply told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by current law .	-7.0714
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the death penalty if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October , which Johnson criticizes as the " capitulation law " that aggravates negotiations with the EU .	-6.6535
On Thursday , former British Prime Minister John Major commented that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law . Johnson could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU left .	-6.2068
Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union . ' We are confident that the EU will leave on 31 October , and the best way is by agreement ' .	-4.7492
Iran seems to be driving up uranium enrichment .	-3.2950
Iran ’ s President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on Europe ’ s contracting partners in the battle to save the historic nuclear deal . " Unfortunately , Europe ’ s states show incapacity or unwillingness to take concrete action , " said Rohani at a press conference on Thursday at the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York .	-7.3277
The conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb , which , in return , contained the promise to normalize economic relations with Tehran , began in 2018 alone from the agreement to force Iran to change course as an aggressive Middle East policy . President Donald Trump ’ s government wants to negotiate a new deal with tougher constraints , and is now back on tough sanctions against Tehran .	-8.8551

Rouhani continues to deny Iran ’ s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia	-1.6266
But , following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September , Germany , France , and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack . Originally , the Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen had become aware of the attack , which the US regarded as a false commitment . " We have nothing to do with it , " Rohani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday .	-13.1574
" Those who make such accusations must produce evidence of this , " said Rohani , but they would not have skillfully summoned the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN general debate ; instead , they would have invoked the rebels in Yemen not to carry out an attack like this .	-7.9829
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump , the US administration ’ s far-reaching sanctions would have to be lifted , calling on Rouhani ’ s government in Washington to pursue a policy of “ dialogue and reason . ”	-5.9937
Comet of another star crosses the solar system .	-3.7216
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe , which was first achieved , and the comet allows conclusions to be made about other solar systems .	-8.1955
What was initially only a presumption is now confirmed : an interstellar guest crossed by our solar system .	-5.6055
On August 30 , the most extensive comet was discovered by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres diameter .	-5.2363
2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be seen at a flight of our solar system after 1I / ' Oumuamua of 2017 .	-5.0173
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get a close insight into a strange solar system before it disappears on Nimmerwiedersehen .	-6.6450
According to the analysis , the comet travels on a so-called Hyperbelbahn , which takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin , as the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) indicated , also responsible for designating and categorizing celestial bodies .	-26.4460
Astronomers are lucky : in contrast to 1I / ' Oumuamua , 2I / Borisov was already sighted in the beginning , so researchers stay for many months for investigations . ' The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be visible by April 2020 with medium sized telescopes ' , Farnocchia explained .	-22.3425
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor , such as a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii , which had already led the characterization of 1I / ' Oumuamua , in a first study showing the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometers .	-5.9057
Researchers from the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries ( IAC ) have already won a first so-called spectrum of interstellar welders offering a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition . " The spectrum of this object is similar to those of our solar system comets , and this points out that its composition must be similar " , reported IAC researcher Julia de León .	-5.9911
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests , according to the IAU , that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems .	-11.9097
By 2028 , the agency intends to set up the three-part space-sond " Comet Interceptor " ( in German , cometen-descending hunters ) on a waiting position of 1.5 million kilometres from the Earth , which , according to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger , is to be either on an untouched , fresh comet from our own solar system , or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I / 'Oumuamua .	-10.2451

Disorder in Washington : Trump wants to find anonymous tippers in Ukraine ’ s affair .	-4.7980
In Ukraine ’ s affair of possible US President Donald Trump ’ s abuse of power , he wants to see possible undue posts in the White House .	-5.5809
" I want to know who gave the whistleblowers the information , " Trump said on Thursday to US envoy staff at the United Nations in New York .	-5.2743
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tippers , but the event was not public , and several US media broadened audio recordings on Friday from the address , with Democrats responding outrageously to the president ’ s statement .	-9.7370
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced on Tuesday preparations for an impeachment proceedings against Trump , with their allegations based primarily on the written complaint by an anonymous intelligence officer who makes serious accusations against Trump and his head of government .	-6.8389
As part of his work , the whistleblower wants to receive information from several government officials that the US president " uses the power of his office " to ensure that another country meddles in its favor in the US election in 2020 .	-6.3107
At the heart of the allegations is a contentious telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July , in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden , dealing with former deals by Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his castles from Ukraine ’ s judiciary . Biden is in the race for the Democratic presidential election in 2020 .	-6.8625
The whistleblowers accused the White House , with a view to the Ukraine-Telefonat , of the cover-up : senior government officials would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the blanket , as usual an electronic word-read protocol , but this was removed from a database normally provided for in the White House , and was instead stored in a particularly protected system .	-11.2537
The New York Times reported that it was supposed to be a member of the CIA ’ s foreign intelligence service .	-5.6538
On Friday , Trump re-questioned the credibility of the source ; in a series of tweets on the issue , the president wrote , among other things , that the " whistleblower " had disseminated second-hand information that would have proved to be incorrect , so there may be no tippers or spies at all .	-7.0298
As Trump said in New York about the whistleblowers , but outrage arose , with US House Chairman Nancy Pelosi reacting alarmingly and lamenting Trump ’ s statement underscoring the government ’ s integrity .	-6.8742
The House of Representatives has been conducting various investigations against Trump and his environment for months in various committees , and , with Ukraine ’ s accusations , the Democrats are now launching investigations with new anguish to launch a possible impeachment procedure against Trump .	-8.1882
" The whistleblowers gave us a roadmap for our investigation , " said the head of the House of Representatives ’ Intelligence Committee , Adam Schiff .	-15.8252
More than 300 former US officials from the security and foreign-policy spheres , mostly democratic , but also Republican presidents , took part in a statement released on Friday behind the Democrats ’ enquiry for a possible impeachment process . If the allegations were true , it would be Trump ’ s “ unscrupulous abuse of power . ”	-8.1332
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure , with the majority in the House of Representatives , the Democrats may be pushing for a so-called impeachment procedure , but the decision on a real impeachment would be in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority , so the prospects for such a process ’ s success are small .	-15.2320
VW Works Council : Jobs are " creeping down " .	-4.2769
The VW brand ’ s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe , which is driving the auto industry ’ s works council to cut its annual factory costs from € 10 billion to € 2 billion by 2023 , saving € 500 million this year .	-8.2788
The " Future Pact " negotiated between companies and works councils between 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020 .	-8.5747
As our newspaper has now learned from working councils , however , jobs in production , which are not actually at a disposition , are being cut over a different path - that is , the official course - so that vacant regular posts are often not re-filled .	-9.7986
In these cases , the works council does not have the option of forcing the re-occupation ; meanwhile , there is a lack of staff to take work condensation , which would increase concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants , and also fears that vehicle production could gradually be deducted from Germany and Europe , because it is cheaper in other parts of the world , : , , , , , , , the , , , , , the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-20.0208

Climate protests <unk> Who are Thunbergs Hintermänner ?	-3.0812
It is all the more surprising that in a world full of war and smoke factories , a 16-year-old girl is keeping the mirror in the nose , but what is behind it ?	-8.6758
On the one hand , Greta Thunberg sets the masses on the move and brings young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world ; historically , it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has created a collection of children and young people . In 1212 , a child named Nikolaus Cologne felt to work for a more just world , when , , Gre, he has a young man to win for himself and cross the sea to get to the country , just as Th, recently made a trip to America sailing .	-12.1640

A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment .	-2.8985
The astronomers ' assumptions have been confirmed : a strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind .	-5.2298

2I / Borisov : Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea .	-2.0029
This body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow in Crimea , who looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observation confirmed his first suspicion .	-6.2426
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain a close insight into a strange solar system .	-7.0065
Comet was already sighted before arrival - and can be observed several months .	-5.0641
But before it is so far , astronomers can observe it in detail , because , unlike his predecessor , 2I / Borisov has already been spotted in his instinct , which means that he can be investigated for many months from Earth . " The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and be visible by April 2020 with medium sized telescopes " , says Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa .	-8.7500
The predecessor of the new visitor : 1I / 2017 U1 " Oumuamua " .	-1.9058
Initial findings on Comet 2I / Borisov raise scientific hopes .	-3.8005
According to the first findings , the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter , and at the same time the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because , as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it , the spectrum of silence is similar to ours .	-6.5562

Boris Johnson , a younger brother , is going to leave the cabinet , and now his sister , in clear terms , is going to leave the Prime 's belligerent language as ' tasteless ' , not the brother she knows .	-10.2604
" Capitalisation " , " Fraud " , " Treaty " : Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is continuing to equip himself - at least verbally - at Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday , this aroused massive opposition outrage , and more critics have now spoken : dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson .	-7.9397
The famous journalist and author said to Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation , as if the opponents of an EU exit were hanging , dragged , tormented , tormented , and tormented . They consider this to be highly reprehensible , and they do not see the version of their brother again , said Rachel Johnsons , who was in the EU elections for the anti-Brexit party Change UK .	-10.9305
In particular , she stated that her brother , Jo Cox , had ordered an EU-friendly underhouse deputy murdered by a neo-Nazi just a few days before the 2016 exit referendum , who could best be honoured by pulling through Brexit , Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons . ' It is very tasteless to refer to a Member murdered by someone who called ' Britain first ' , now criticized Johnson 's sister , who was apparently from the far right camp , ' reinforced by this kind of language ' , which she feels very distrusted to taste .	-11.8102
He also criticized the Prime Minister 's widow , " It makes me ill when Jo 's name is used in this way , " he twittered . " The best way to honor them is to be and resolutely committed to what one believes to , but never to " demonize " the other , complaining that an atmosphere was created in which attacks were more likely .	-9.5583
Just a few weeks ago , Boris Johnson younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory MP . " I have been torn apart between loyalty to the family and the national interest in recent months - it is an intractable tension , " explained Jo Johnson .	-6.0797

Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer .	-4.2941
The announcement of mid-term passengers is eagerly awaited every time in the US , and many this year view the choice as a political gesture , not least through President Donald Trump ’ s immigration policy .	-6.5409
The Super Bowl is the largest US sporting event and also a gigantic advertising spectacle .	-5.8347
Last year , political controversy arose in the run-up to the quarterback of Colin Kaepernick , who , in protest against police violence against black people , refused to stand up when the national anthem was played , and for which , among other things , US President Donald Trump had strongly approached it .	-9.6811
An actor and Youtuber places Egypt ’ s ruler : For the time being , however , Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad .	-5.0544
The two men who have an influence on whether blood is again flowing on the streets of Egypt , both spent last week abroad , one of them floated back at Cairo airport on Friday , and President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly .	-11.4549
Mohamed Ali remained abroad , of course , where he escaped the security forces that would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil .	-7.0685
He goes directly to the head of state and in a very rustic language . While the people are hungry , the president is hovering in luxury and can build sumptuous new palaces , the army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule is blaming Ali for corruption and enrichment .	-8.8294
Last week , after Sisi ’ s grip on power demonstrated thousands against his rule , and nearly 2000 citizens , including prominent figures from civil society , human rights lawyers , and opposition politicians , were arrested , Ali called for a “ million-march ” for this Friday , with so many people really daring to go to the streets , but there were some minor protests , for example in Giseh near Cairo , and in Kina near Luxor , videos in social media showing protests that Al Sisi was accused of corruption and his demise .	-11.4472
In the city of Mansura in the Nildelta , where demonstrators shot banners with the President 's portrait , massive police presence was reported on Friday , security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the exit roads , several underground stations in the city center were closed for " maintenance work " , most roads around Tahrirplatz , the heart of the 2011 revolution , were blocked , and in the Rabaa Square , where supporters of the ousted Mursi protested until the army took fire and killed 800 people , and another one was to prevent Sisis from meeting here : one of Sisi 's great parties wanted to hold a meeting for the President of the future .	-13.7079
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics : " Our goal must not be the Tahrirplatz , " said Ali in Barcelona , in his video camera . " Let us with police " , , : " Egypt is .	-10.1070
If the provider promises too much performance	-2.6476
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than the provider advertises , there are different testing possibilities .	-5.1858
If you sign up to an Internet contract , you don 't need to blindly trust the vendor ’ s speed data ; customers can check for how much of it is actually achieved when it comes to performance .	-9.9259
After all , the previously promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved , explains the Consumer Centre Bavaria .	-4.6127
If the connection is always much slower than the provider advertises , there are different testing possibilities , so the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency ( BNetzA ) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract .	-6.0421
" However , the tests carried out by the providers are carried out according to bidder specific specifications and are therefore not calculated in a uniform and objective manner " , states the Consumer Centres Bavaria on their side .	-11.4811
If the connection is much slower than announced , customers can usually set a reasonable period of 14 days to produce the promised service , and the best thing they can do is to write to the provider in writing .	-9.6406
If this does not work after several requests , customers can cancel and claim damages under certain circumstances .	-7.6018

Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukraine ’ s President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine , because Trump has been watching “ for years . ”	-4.8502
Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the whistleblower-affair ; few have shown unease about it ; Scott ’ s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party .

One thing : Herzogin Meghan did not return to the final for a final farewell pit as Rachel Zane , at least not for new scenes ; instead , some glimpses again showed the most memorable scenes with today ’ s duke , such as the moments of the failed and the happy wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his retired prison sentence .	-8.8272

The increased numbers have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016 , suggesting that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come illegally from Turkey to the Greek islands , in exchange for the EU ’ s intention to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every displaced Syrian .	-7.6925
However , the processing of asylum applications is only progressing with difficulty due to a lack of personnel on the Greek side , and Lesbos , Chios , Samos , Leros and Kos , according to the Ministry of Civil Protection , have nearly 29 400 people , the worst of which is the situation in Lesbos : 5200 migrants are currently housed in a capacity camp for 650 people .	-9.2722

Influencerin wants free upgrade : Lifelong flight ban at Cathay	-3.0010
Jaqueline Ng was promised an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific , but when she asked for it at check-in she was not allowed to fly on board - and she was never allowed to fly again with Cathay .	-6.5879
There is also an upgrade for Business Class - many of them dream of passengers , and sometimes they are lucky , and the check-in staff offer a change from Economy Class for free .	-9.2214

However , as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail , the case remains clear : Cathay has committed the influenza virus fraud , it remains closed for future flights , and the airline ’ s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay the new flight .	-10.0906
Oil prices according to the report on the ceasefire in Yemen	-2.7938
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the Friday lunchtime , with a barrel ( 159 liters ) of the North Sea resorts of Brent 61.83 US dollars – roughly 1.4 % less than the previous day . The price of a barrel of American West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) fell by 1.3 % to $ 55.77 .	-7.7641
A Wall Street Journals report on a ceasefire in Yemen triggered the price slide , with Saudi Arabia agreeing to a ceasefire in four areas .	-5.3495
A drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil installations in mid-September brought down five per cent of global oil production , with Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war of Yemen clashing for themselves . Saudi Arabia , like the US government , blames Iran , for defusing political tension in the region .	-7.9044
If agreement is reached , growth and demand can be concentrated , Ole Hansen , head of Saxo Bank ’ s Commodity Strategy department at the news agency Bloomberg , said .	-5.1508
The price of oil is thus continuing its downward movement of the past few days , with a barrel of WTI oil still costing almost $ 59 a week , Brent nearly $ 65 .	-5.4802
Last but not least , after the attack in mid-September , Bloomberg reported to Insider that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia proceeded faster than expected , with output reaching a volume of eight million bara per day , , , , .	-10.9071
Last but not least , there have been several press releases calling for insiders to report on the rapid progress of Saudi Aramco , the Saudi oil company , in repairs , but commodity experts point out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock exchange and is trying to avoid negative headlines .	-8.0696

North Korea ’ s third summit with Trump and Kim is questionable .	-3.5021
North Korea has raised doubts that there will soon be a third summit of leaders , Kim Jong-un , and US President Donald Trump . The sense and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first Singapore summit , says top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday , according to the agency KCNA .	-6.9419
The US would not have done anything to implement the summit ’ s decisions last year , said North Korean State Department adviser , who also criticized intensified US sanctions and joint US and South Korean military exercises , but he hopes for a “ wise ” and “ bold ” Trump ’ s decision to return to rapprochement .	-6.8032
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit should bring with him before he agreed to do so ; the negotiations on disarmament of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February ; and in June , they met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states , agreeing to relaunch the talks , but without great success . .	-12.9340

British Pound under Pressure	-1.7889
In the face of an early cut in interest rates , the pound loses value against the euro .	-6.5214
Frankfurt speculated on a swift interest rate cut from the Bank of England ( BoE ) to the pound Sterling , and the British currency blended by up to 0.4 % on Friday to $ 1.2269 .	-5.8720
The result of the sales was statements by central banker Michael Saunders , who called for an interest-rate cut , even if chaotic Brexit could be averted , because uncertainty will affect the British economy in the foreseeable future . This statement is surprising , because Saunders , as a defender of a restrictive monetary policy , told Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of Brokerhaus ActivTrades .	-8.2888
Last week , the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy caused by the Brexit hickhack , without directly signaling a cut in interest rates . Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to leave the EU without a divorce agreement , if necessary .	-6.7158

Doping : Further Russian Manipulations	-1.5017
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman , the one-time director of the World Antidoping Agency ( Wada ) and today 's head of the World athletics Association .	-5.5850
In January 2019 , the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency ( Wada ) , and it turned out that they were falsified .	-5.9205
In December 2014 , the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( Rusada ) had been banned for three years , during which time Russian athletes were not entirely banned from the world stage .	-12.9224
There are no positive findings .	-2.5723
In the following September , the Wada raised the Rusada Bann again , but called for access to the laboratory and the samples in question , and the data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases , helping athletes and athletes to .	-12.6393
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission ( AIU ) of the World Light athletics Association ( IAAF ) has now confirmed that doping data from the Moscow Analyst Laboratory have been manipulated . " Yes , we received the data nine months ago , we should check whether the task task force has received the right data , " said David Howman in the interview of the " Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung " of Friday .	-6.9495
The World Cup	-2.6629
This confirms the IAAF ’ s position : The athletic association is the only organisation to hold its bans on Russia , with 30 Russian athletes flying neutral flags at Doha , demonstrating that they are training and testing outside the Russian system .	-8.7839
At the beginning of this week , the Wada had already put manipulation in the room and asked Russia to respond within three weeks to the allegations , and Russia is now threatening to ban Rusada again and , in the worst case , to ban the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo .	-7.8376
