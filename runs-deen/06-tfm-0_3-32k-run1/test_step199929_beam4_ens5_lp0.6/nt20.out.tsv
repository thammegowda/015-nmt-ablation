After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he never voted in the World Football election , other countries alleging the Fifa . Egypt was not traded with a curious explanation .	-8.7979
Much of the Fifa has proven to be a beating in recent years : the WM-Vergaben , dubious plans of its president , Gianni Infantino , the general behavior of diverser corrupt officials , but the Fifa World Football election has so far not been suspected of running unclean - if one agrees that the eligible national trainers and national capitals of the member federations are often more likely to vote according to the objective assessment .	-11.7310
But , after Nicaragua ’ s captain had complained , he did not vote at all , yet another inconsistency emerged : Egypt complains that the voices of National trainers Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account ; indeed , they appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview .	-6.4021
The Fifa apologises to the fact that " the signatures on the electoral forms were issued in large letters and therefore not valid " , the Egyptian association has several times in order to the situation .	-11.4609

Ukraine-Affars : Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation .	-3.3044
Two ranghohe Republicans have openly advocated an official investigation against US President and party friend Donald Trump , " I think the investigation is important , " said the Republican governor of the US federal state Vermont , Phil Scott . " Where that is going to be carried out here , the facts stated " He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action .	-8.6576
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine .	-4.9611
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower-afflicted affair , but few have been uneasy , so Scotts ’ statements are now a first sign of Trump ’ s party , with Trump ’ s moderate governor of Virginia ’ s policies on several occasions , such as the loosening of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations .	-9.8893
As another senior Republican , Charlie Baker , Governor of Massachusetts , also spoke for the investigation , " It is a deeply disturbing situation , " Baker said . " The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the bottom " .	-7.6050
Scott and Baker have formally decided not to participate in the proceedings against Trump , which is why your statements are particularly symbolic , but the first senators of the Republicans have been critical of the situation , including Mitt Rom, the state of in , , , , , , , , , and . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-15.3023
The affair could result in the introduction of an impeachment procedure against Trump , who Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into the use of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit .	-6.8961
For the inauguration process , there is no precise timetable ; with its majority in the House of Representatives , the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment ; the decision on a real impeachment , but in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans have a majority ; the prospects for such a process have thus been low ; so far , no US president has been exposed by an impeachment process of office .	-9.4081

Three men have been arrested in Sicily , they have been raped and ordained in Libyan refugee camps .	-2.8711
The German captain Carola Rackete ( 31 ) was arrested in June , after being fired with the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 lybischen refugees on board the port of Lampedusa , and after fierce protests and international criticism - including by Austria 's President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was cancelled a few days from an Italian judge .	-7.0068
Now , new serious allegations against rackets could be blamed for three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps , with the " Sea-Watch 3 " arrived in Italy .	-7.7556
From the police , it was in mid-September that the suspects were raped in the North African country , tortured and even ordained ; it was Mohammed C.

" The migrants were systematically harassed and atrocities exposed - by repeated and permanent physical violence , " it was stated in the communication .	-6.3448
NGO and aid organisations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who ships arrive , ' We cannot scan who the people are , without passports ' , said new-built torture is one of the main reasons why the people flee Libya , and it is therefore likely that the perpetrators are on the ships ' ; ' It is therefore very important that we should follow up ' .	-10.4860

US budget dispute : Renewed only a bridge financing	-3.9767
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget , and the Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has adopted a transitional financing by 21 November .	-5.7281
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed on an increase in spending ceilings for the fiscal year 2020 and 2021 , the United States faced a new fiscal year starting on October 1 , even more without spending plans , with the Senate followed on Thursday the House of Representatives , and adopted a transitional financing ( Continuing Resolution , CR ) by November 21 , without such a decision , it would have come into force on Monday , midnight on a Shutdown , including the federal administration .	-9.4525
Shutdown wasted	-2.2691
For the time being , the federal administration will now be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 , because Congress has not agreed on the 12 spending laws that can allocate the various departments and authorities the funds , and the federal administration cannot , therefore , benefit from the new financial year of 1.3 Bio .	-9.7031
The Democrats in the House of Representatives , where they have made the majority , ten of the twelve laws , but the spending laws reflect the Democrats ’ priorities , which have barely been missed by the Republicans , while the Senate also has ten of the 12 spending plans , or less willing to do so .	-9.5227
The clergy , especially on the issue of resource allocation for domestic security and border security , seems to be trying to force the Republicans to inherit $ 12 billion for the Wall , one of the major priorities of President Trump , the Democrats are disrupting the foot-and-mouth plans and their financing , which is actually intended for other military construction and projects , and the dispute over the toll inherited in December 2018 has already escalated and has led to a 35-day Shutdown .	-11.3287
At Mauerbau , the ghosts of . .	-6.9204
At the moment , it is unclear how the parties are going to come closer to this issue , and probably as an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November , and a shutdown is not possible .	-8.9048
Against the backdrop of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on twelve spending laws in time , and the associated risk of a Shutdown winning ideas to automate the process of popularity , with the submission of p . 1877 to avoid Shutdowns , the financing of federal administration would automatically continue to lead to the level of the previous year , the travel activity of parliamentarians , and their wages will be withheld until the new annual spending plans are submitted .	-11.8793
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles	-5.1468
In France , artificial fertilization will continue to be the only women and lesbians living in the future : the Parisian National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill that would allow all women to claim in vitro fertilization , and that would increase demand for anonymous sampling .	-12.9487
In the three-day emotional debate , critics in the right-wing camp warned that in the future many " children without father " could grow up .	-6.5854
The new regulation is the most important part of a bioethics law , which the Minister for Health Agnès Buzyn defended as an ' opportunity ' for society , and it is the modern family that only one parent or with homosexual parents , who , after their idea , are to pay the costs of artificial fertilisation for all women of social security .	-10.6608
Requirements with sperm of dead husband further prohibited	-5.8009
By a narrow majority , the National Assembly rejected an amendment allowing widows for artificial insemination of access to the sperm of its dead man , whereas in Belgium , Spain and the United Kingdom , the artificial insemination of " post-mortem " was allowed .	-8.9472
Many members of the governing party La République en Marche ( The Republic of the Movement , LREM ) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition opposed the artificial insemination with the blocking of the late partner .	-5.6473
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow may be allowed to be infertile in the future with the sperm of an unknown , but not with its own partner .	-7.6173
So far , artificial fertilization in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples , which cannot be children , and they must be married or have lived together for at least two years , in .	-7.6542
In Germany , artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples , but it is often difficult .	-4.3536

President Donald Trump ’ s administration has drastically reduced the world ’ s readiness for refuge from all over the past few years , with the Obama administration ’ s predecessor , far higher reception limits .	-7.5435
The peilte ceiling of 18,000 refugees has been the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980 , while the US State Department called the " impoverishment " and the most generous nation in history , a phrase that is strongly reminiscent of the current US president ’ s language .	-9.8635
A " responsible handling " of refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild , Trump declared , for his hard course in migration policy , he receives much support from followers , but there is also massive criticism .	-8.4241
A major dispute is the border with Mexico , which Trump wants to seal , and to finance the construction of a border wall , Trump had imposed the National Emergency Board , whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the US capital , is unclear ; Trump is currently under threat of the Selenskyj-affair and possibly impeding impeachment .	-8.8722
The US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future , which are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger of emerging from the declaration of the State Department , but Honduras , Guatemala and El Salvador are expected to receive a maximum of 1500 refugees .	-9.2064

Stocking Brexit negotiations : The danger of a no-deal remains acute .	-1.9437
In fact , Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly stated : he will give him a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations , but what statements have already been made by the polarizing Britons of eternal duration , and the recent ruling by the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom , as a sword of Damocles over the Blondschopf ; his suspension of Parliament to be able to carry out its Brexit course until the departure date has been cancelled earlier this week , and a deal passed by Parliament has obliged Johnson to do so in the case of failed negotiations with the EU until 31 October , but the bilateral talks have brought about that Johnson has always .	-21.3538
Boris Johnson keeps Deal even possible	-5.9839
But the pressure does not seem to be noticeably over Johnson , and in the meantime he made a visit to a hospital , suggesting that in the event of a non-agreement by the end of October , he support an extension of negotiations :	-8.4343
Know , we shall abide by the law .	-3.3293
At the same time , however , we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October .	-1.9802

And the time has come for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels , and about six weeks now the EU and British negotiators have come to prevent Britain ’ s withdrawal from the European Union without any agreement , but the recent talks have not yet achieved a breakthrough ; an agreement until the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine ; the British Prime Minister is not the law ; a new postponement of the exit date will come into force ; the opposition is suspicious of the Prime Minister ’ s words , but do not fear that Johnson might prevail in the case of no-deal than Brexit .	-15.3224

A call in Ukraine , and everything is broken ? US President Donald Trump could be confronted with the turbulent revelations of the past few days with an impeachment procedure that Democrats want to examine with their inquiry in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is coming from weeks to a decision .	-7.3189
At the beginning of the scandal , it is alleged that the telephone call with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj , accused of whistleblowers who are concerned about national security and about the democracy of the United States , will ultimately be brought to the public , monstrous : the President has abused the power of his office to instruct the government of another country to exert influence on the 2020 election .	-16.7967
The nucleus of this project is also in the meantime published co-writing of the interview with Selenskyj , although it does not reflect the full text , but the phone of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story in whose center next to Trump is above all his personal lawyer : Rudy Giuliani .	-8.7504
The story takes place from the public ’ s point of view in May 2019 , when the New York Times reported by Rudy Giuliani ’ s travel plans in Ukraine ; he wants to meet in Kiev with the very elected President Selenskyj , and the lawyer knows very well that his intentions are delicate . ' We are not in an election , we are interfering in an investigation that we have the right ' , he says that the newspaper can think it is inappropriate , but ' it is not illegal ' .	-10.1690
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that are fixated on Trump ’ s counter-candidate at the 2016 election : Hillary Clinton had colluded with actors in Ukraine , then critics said that to construct an occasion for Russia ’ s investigations in the US , but this charge was never serious .	-8.7905
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk about in July on the phone with Selenskyj so prominent , the version Giulianis and the president is : the former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy , Joe Biden , as Ukraine-Beauftragter of the Obama administration to dismiss the then-Ukrainian general prosecutor Viktor Schokin , in order to stop the investigation of the gas company that his son Hunter Biden was financially responsible for .	-10.8185
Indeed , unlike Joe Biden , the Ukrainian Public Prosecutor ’ s General needed to investigate gas companies , Hunter Biden has never been directly affected by it , and has been accused of even deeply corrupt donors who were not the only Western partner who pushed his dismissal , and , incidentally , the Obama administration .	-10.0014

Will British government circumvent Brexit law ? Johnson restrained .	-4.5865
The British Prime Minister , Boris Johnson , is concerned about whether he is seeking ways to bypass the law recently adopted by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit , and a question he said on Friday was merely to keep his government alive .	-8.6025
The law stipulates that the government should request a postponement of the exit stermins , until mid-October , no agreement with the EU was reached , except Johnson criticises this as ' capitulation law ' , which created negotiations with the EU .	-6.7741

Iran appears to be highly enriching uranium	-3.1030

In the light of the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb , which included the promise of Tehran to normalize economic relations , the US stepped in 2018 in the single-handedly agreement to impose " maximum pressure " on Iran to change its course as an aggressive Middle East policy .	-9.8873

Rouhani continues to engage Iran in attacks in Saudi Arabia	-2.6394
However , following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September , the Gemengelage changed : Germany , France , and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US estimate that Tehran had a responsibility for the assault on Iran , while the rebels supported Huthi rebels in Yemen were aware of what the United States saw as a false commitment to trade union . " We have nothing to do with this , " Rouhani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday .	-9.7388
" Those who make such accusations must provide evidence , " said Rohani , who led the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN general debate , but not skillfully ; instead , they would only have called for the rebels to launch an assault in Yemen , as they could not have done in recent days with Chancellor Angela Merkel , France ’ s President Emmanuel Macron , and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson .	-9.6595

Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the world , and this has only been achieved .	-8.7140
What was initially only a suspicion has now been confirmed : an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system .	-5.5715
The most extensive comet was discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomers Gennadi Borissow on the Margo Observatory on the Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres of diameter .	-11.6080

According to the Komet analysis , on a so-called hyperbelbahn , which leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin , as the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) announced , it is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies .	-6.8619
In contrast to 1I / ' Oumuamua , 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in the beginning , so the researchers stay for many months for research . " The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will be seen until April 2020 with medium telescopes " , explained Farnocchia , " after until October 2020 , only with larger telescopes .	-9.7841
A number of observatories have already targeted the visitor , and a certain team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii , who had already redirected the characterization of 1I / ' Oumuamua , in a first survey of the diameters of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometers .	-8.2366

Uproar in Washington : Trump wants anonymous tippers in Ukraine-Affars .	-5.4919
In Ukraine ’ s affair of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump , Trump wants to undo possible positions in the White House .	-5.4311
" I want to know who gave the whistleblowers the information , " Trump said on Thursday before US envoy staff at the United Nations in New York .	-4.5348
This was seen as a intimidation against Tippers , but the event was not actually public , but several US media broadened on Friday ’ s audio recordings of the speech by Democrats responded to the President ’ s statement .	-9.4949
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced Tuesday preparations for an impeachment procedure against Trump , and their accusations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who collects serious accusations against Trump and his government ’ s central , with major public pressure shields from Thursday ’ s signatories .	-10.6653
In his work , Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government officials that the US president uses " the power of his office " to ensure that another country interferes in the US 2020 election .	-5.8892
In the center of accusations is a contentious telephone call between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July , in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate his political rival , Joe Biden , who is talking about earlier deals by Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his palaces from Ukraine ’ s judiciary .	-7.1067
The whistleblowers accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine-Telefonat also the cover-up : leading government officials would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling , as usual , an electronic word-prone protocol has been produced , which , according to the conversation , was usually removed from the White House from a normally planned database and instead stored in a specially protected system .	-11.4938
The identity of the publisher is not publicly known , " The New York Times " reported that it should be a member of the CIA ’ s foreign intelligence staff .	-7.1767
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source in a series of tweets on the subject , the president wrote , among other things , that " whistleblowers " have spread information from second hand , which might have turned out to be inaccurate , so there may be no tippers or spies .	-9.0839
As Trump said in New York about those who are supposed to have lived up to the whistleblowers , but indignation was triggered by the US House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , reacted with concern and complained that Trump ’ s statement once again undermined the government ’ s integrity .	-8.2857
In the House of Representatives , several investigations have been underway for months in various committees against Trump and his environment , with Ukraine-accusations now driving democrats forward with new anger to launch a possible impeachment process against Trump .	-8.2627
" The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation , " said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives , Adam Schiff . Trump crashed and the wrong presentation of things and called for the resignation of the chairman of the committee .	-8.3955

VW Works Council : Jobs are dismantled " creeping " .	-3.4813
The VW brand ’ s plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe .	-7.7919
A key to this is the recruitment costs , which are negotiated between companies and works council in 2016 " Zukunftspakt " , which already provides for the dismantling of 14.000 jobs in Germany alone .	-8.5558
However , as our newspaper has said , jobs in production , which are not really at the disposition , are being dismantled ' creeping ' over another way - that is to say , the official course is over , so regulars are .	-12.1714
In these cases , the works council has no opportunity to force the reoccupation , and in many places now there is a lack of staff who are suspected of taking care of a gradual phasing out of the vehicles , and the fear that the vehicle production could be withdrawn from Germany and Europe , because it is cheaper in other parts of the world , from VW there was only one adjustment of the employment volume , as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve .	-14.5422
The VW brand wants to standardise production worldwide and centrally manage new projects , thereby reducing costs and accelerating decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness .	-8.1862

Rental suddenly ceases : WeWork leaves real estate markets trembling	-3.8948
In New York , WeWork is the largest office tenant .	-3.8995
Within a few years , WeWork is rising from the small start-up to the most expensive real estate markets in the world , but now the company is in crisis .	-5.8755
The crisis of the office leaser WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world ’ s largest real estate markets , and the company had postponed the planned stock market downturn a few days ago , with the sale of subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for executives to gain financial room for the coming weeks and months , and also reported , among other things , the British Financial Times , WeWork , the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect .	-13.2585
In the short term , WeWork rents large office areas and rents them to small units , and individual freelancers , small startups , or entire departments of large corporations , can be burnt with this business at a staggering rate , with a loss of $ 1.6 billion last year , with sales of $ 1.8 billion , and in this year alone the rental of new large areas estimated at $ 2.5 billion .	-12.8364

According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert von der Cornell Law School in New York , WeWork rented in Manhattan , one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world , in the last 24 months , almost 300,000 square meters of office space , and WeWorks Neuverträge alone ensured that demand for offices in New York was greater than that in this period , the newly acquired land was rebuilt without WeWorks Expansion , the office space in the US metropolis increased in this time , as Alpert wrote in the Business Insider .	-17.4642

Many landlords have rebuilt their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investment , so that his business model would soon have to make profitable , the property owners would have to write off a portion of the expected billionaire income , access to the already scarce reserves of WeWork , despite the long-term tenancy contracts , because renting the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by specially established subsidiaries , so-called Special Purpose Vehicles , for which the parent company is liable only in narrow limits .	-11.4938
