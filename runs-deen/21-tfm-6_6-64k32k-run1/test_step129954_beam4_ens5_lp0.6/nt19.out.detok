DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil ’ s Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil ’ s return to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on the fact that you talk to him, that you also talk to him about why he obviously felt one thing or another as it is written in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasanmower" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite months of debate over Özil ’ s photographs with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of Özil, a 92-fold national player.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed, at some point, that this would be the case, "said Grindel.
In July, the 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team and justified this on the grounds that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared to talk to federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up any pressure, but he knows from football that if you leave a team or change an association, you talk to your trainer and I think it is a pity that this conversation has not yet come about.
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned.
At 2.13 p.m. the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angerrhofweg.
Because a high-voltage pipeline leads directly through the allotment settlement, risk was in arrears.
The fire brigade went out and found the cabin at the reception in full fire.
The roof had to be removed practically as a whole and fire debris removed to the extent that was absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had inserted a battery for lunch.
That may be the cause of the fire.
In any case the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity according to the fire department.
The damage caused by the fire must be determined, as must the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry Mother Fights Back: Lindsay Lohan Attacks on the Road of Refugees
What has led Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to take the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has himself streamed live as she seems to want to take children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial cut of the stream.
Here you see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan.
In the clip you can see how Lohan leaves a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to identify as a Syrian refugee family.
When the family fled the actress, Lohan pursued the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of trafficking in children.
For all this she does not provide any proof in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this," Lohan says in the video how she follows the family along the road.
She appears to be trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she is turning around and Lohan is giving a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress prays how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid.

She is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that she can suck material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The Lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Travellers abroad: The number of deaths on Sulawesi is rising to more than 400.
At least 420 people have been killed following the severe 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The number of victims could increase still further.
The rescue teams have not yet reached the devastated and isolated areas.
Elon Musk resigned as Tesla Chairman of the Supervisory Board
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla boss Elon Musk worried equity markets in early August, when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and Tesla ’ s chairman withdraws from the board, but he may remain the chairman of the board.
British Conservative Party Congress
Stringent Guards - The Tory Congress
Birmingham will be the stage of a power struggle.
The Party Congress is supposed to address foreign policy, trade issues, and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the quarrel between Prime Minister Theresa May and the hardline Brexiteers, led by former foreign minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a New State
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed.
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about this name duplication for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia should in future be called North Macedonia and the people will vote on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Der nicht") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil ’ s presidential election, the mood is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate, leading the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Workers ’ Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" reworking takes longer than planned.
"The Diesel Task Force still exists," said Development Board Peter Mertens to the "Automobilwoche" industry magazine.
Rupert Stadler, the imprisoned and begotten Audi CEO, announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations are expected to be tested," he said.
Mertens now said: 'At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was created in September 2015, following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Volkswagen, Audi ’ s mother.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal could never happen again.
On Friday, the Volkswagen Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler ’ s future and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with wrong exhaust values after the exhaust gas fraudsters became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schop is Head of Sales and Chief Executive Officer of the Commission.
Due to the conversion to the new exhaust and fuel test standard WLTP, production losses at Audi, said Scho of the "Heilbronner Voice".
In general, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
He is relying on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi-Elektroauto, 15,000 reservations have already been made.
Grindel is seeking re-election - Lahm is expected to join the DFB Bureau.
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to stand for DFB President again next year despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as guest at ZDF's "Aktuelle Sportstudio" on early Sunday morning.
There is always a need to seek re-election, and I shall do so.
And then you have to check if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if, after winning the European Football Championship in 2024, he did not "want to work on the future project".
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who was ousted by the summer fairy tales affair.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be at the DFB Bundestag on September 27, 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM-Chief Organiser Philipp Lahm is to work on the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau were to agree that he would continue to discuss this role in the Bureau and that he would of course be warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
Lahm was not interested in joining in speculation as to whether he might be his successor as DF.
As a consequence of the case concerning the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player with no migrant background should become DFB integration ambassador.
Currently this office is held by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If anyone without an immigrant background has a clear influence on society and football and says that 'the issue is important, we have to deal with it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration has to work ', said Grindel.

I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scales that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the Würscht.
He says nothing about whether I have replaced fat with muscles.

Erdoğan Opening Mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with, among others, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite adherents of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
The city center of Cologne was partially closed for the opening of the Ditib Mosque.
Several thousand police officers were in action, including snipers.
Ditib, the Association of Islam, is critical because it is regarded as an extension of the Turkish Government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Secrets
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have campaigned in a joint concert in New York ’ s Central Park for more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease.
"Committed to you wherever you can," said Mendes in front of some 60,000,000 spectators at the festival on Sunday night.
Thank you for coming here, it is a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringe and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations, also took part in this multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a shock second when many spectators saw the sound of a crumbling metal barrier as shots, were afraid and tried to flee.
In short, panic arose, people ran into confusion.
Seven viewers were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people off the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and distribute on the Internet texts, photos, and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was cheer and applause from the audience - Buhrufe for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake, in the US Senate Judiciary Committee, declared himself in favour of appointing Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court Judge, offending many women.
At least three women have made accusations of abuse, including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the charges, after two women, according to their own data, faced him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.
"You can also meet me at any time in an elevator," said Flake at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends the journalist ’ s Rauhurf
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert defended the ouster of a journalist from the press conference held by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a question of disrupting the proceedings of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has caused a great deal of unrest, which is unacceptable.
That is why he has led people who protect people to get the man out.
Seibert said that it is not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely irrespective of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or of supporting or membership of banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
Turkey ’ s leaders blame the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the journalists accused face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are not sure of the Turkish authorities either: it was only at the beginning of September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and good-natured as Florian David Fitz.
We have to look at this twice: yes, that really is Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is known for lively conversations at the bar of the Hamburger Hafenknecipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets her guests with some beer, some wine or even more important drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities are also encouraging compulsory vocal interventions.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, actor Florian David Fitz is known for films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Best Day".
The trip to the far north was not good for the Munich.
On Saturday he postulated a Selfie - his face is completely broken on it, the eyes are only two small slits.
The Bed Selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he put forward some of the insights he has now gained: "Rule one: NIE goes to Ines night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And syringe.
And the egg liqueur, which ina packs about half three, also leaves out.
Alcohol consumption is truly in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted some tips to combat the aftershocks.
They ranged from instant broth, fish broth, or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply amused the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
As Ina Müller has survived the nocturnal sizzling, it is not known yet.
The 53-year-old seems to have been much more successful in his career as she has already moderated the TV match on the counter since 2007...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa Fights Vandalism and Unrat
The entry to the 36-kilometer railway path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Broken, cigarette dumps, rubbish and waste, scrapped dustbins and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance with a group of seats on the bicycle path on the hill of Haasse in Treysa has been presented for some time.
For the showcase railway path in the Rotkäppchenland a more than inglorious sight.
The topic has occupied members of the ADFC-Ortsgruppe Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the Radverkehrsbeauftragter der Stadt Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The issue has already been raised in the Committee on Cycling.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals range from moving the seat group to regularly emptying waste tanks and cleaning the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - irrespective of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also introduced the topic to the local council.
Not only the garbage is killing cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebrations on weekends.
Not only is there a lot of noise going on, but also a lot of damage is being done on the gells: piles are being taken out of the ground, dustbin is being demolished, signs are being turned around, seating is being covered.
Volunteers have already cleared up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klipert.
But the actions are just the proverbial drop in the ocean.
You are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for the Saufgelage.
"Along the entire cycle path there is a clear focus on the Haaße Hill", says the cyclist's representative, who is now also concerned about the new Radetäte in Ziegenhin, which is being opened today.
"If she learns the same fate, it becomes quite expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this raises the threshold of becoming a common good.
This would, however, require a police strike to pass by shortly.
In general Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the Haasse hill.
It must be made more attractive.
After all, you can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The marketing of tourism is still in a position to develop.
Our bicycle path is very high in comparison with others in Germany, "says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klipert considers the situation in Ascherfeder Straße in Treysa to be extremely.
There is no bending on the hill of Haaße.
In the case of regular traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between two-way traffic flow, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake.
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
To offer "D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the city district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Musikcontest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the likeable Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family get-together with coffee and cakes from the honorary authorities of the Cultural Railway Station.
Seven formations took place, from the one man band to the great ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albachter living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper star colours", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland Kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwinges.
This contest, according to district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen that in other parts of the city.
What did the authors see associated with?
Hiltruper See and the market allee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue in his strikingly like song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Time and again it was about living together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the artists or hints about their work.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry but now also taught guitar.
Franke knew from sound engineer Stefan Schemelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper's gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury ’ s favorites – so that others can listen to their songs as well.
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schmmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer, who impressed Franke particularly with his musicality, and the "Lummerland Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two guitar and Cajon teachers, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children went to the finals again - and even without electronic support sounded "really good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the originality, reference to Hiltrup, ease of melody and recognition value.
The jury was composed of Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The city district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a full success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the very near cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test.
The players form two teams that face each other.
For each page there is a visual screen, in which there are four cards with keywords that you - the old trick with the red foil - can decipher only once you have inserted them.
This ensures that the other side can read nothing by mistake.
On the maps, for example, read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3. Dice.
4. Fest '.
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
It is not the concepts that should be guessed here, but the codes.
Replacing one player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card with possibly "3.4.2".
"Decrypto" should not be the words behind the secret foil, but its encryption codes.
His task in this case: to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice", "feast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible does not; for that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The cipher thus notes and reads loudly: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as opposed to festival; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prague" because he has taken care of in school and knows the window collapse there.
This is round by round, team by team.
You do not know the terms of the other side, but you can make it more consistent with any indication given by the cipher.
If it's mysterious, but not too twisted, you might want to make it harder for your team.
The crypt of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time before they can finally play.
The explanatory video on decrypto.info in the net makes it easier.
But once you start, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
But overall "Decrypto" is not as conclusive as predecessors and Genre-Primus "codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game with fewer words but much better to play in small groups.
And if you are just talking about rates and not about victory points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: man shows police Hitlergruß and harass guests in the pub.
A 48-year-old employed the police inspection at Kulmbach twice on the night of Saturday on Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler's grudge in the Upper City of a passing police strike, then later he also fell in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he had to spend the night at the police station Kulmbach in the prison cell, he had to spend the night.
In a sober state he must also be criminally responsible for the use of registration plates of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was home to the Schucklok factory
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers popped at buffers, it was heard in the press," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
No one noticed that.
The brakes were squashed and the wagons were cracked.
It was pure railways.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel ’ s home town of Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railways.
Here was the starting point of the steep ridge to the north, which after a rise of about 220 m altitude has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, drawers and drawers were previously needed, which had their home in Pres.
In 1901, the Bavarian Land Day approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotives, apprenticeships, carriageway and railway master.
"The heart was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railroad.
The Pressig Railway Works (BW), which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettu, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalb.
On 15 July 1950 the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steams- and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimised the need for traction and thrust locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991 at least 10 000 weighing was ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were abandoned, and in 1991 the rest were abandoned.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that one did not envisage a better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg railway station celebrated a pompous festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
Soon afterwards, the end of the war.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig railway station was history.
"The rangers and shotgun shotguns did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mishandling would have had fatal consequences.
Why the railway station Prestig-Rothenkirchen has led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two towns and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with Kick Success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing, just like Julia Görges before.
Kerber siegtebei the China Open 6: 2, 6: 2 against the French woman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegeemund led 6: 3, 4: 2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian player placed at number 13 gave up.
The sponges are now dealing with Anett Konteveit from Estonia.
In the course of the series "Art and Pleasure" a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelehenbach.
It was with great relief that registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open area of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelheerbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the Tourist Association "Around Walberla" in the "Art and Pleasure" series.
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great acclaim demonstrated the fascination of the exhibition.
21 specimens of 20 artists are now to be seen in Mittelhonerbach.
Owner Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the opening of the opening of the opening of the exhibition.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
The same goes for Volker Hahn, who made himself a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
But, somewhat surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his job in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
In the past, both played an active part in the selection of artists and created flyers.
This year again, a 70-cent special stamp, designed by art & pleasure, is available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austenungen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high reception of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler could be won for the musical performance from Nuremberg.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "windplay performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" of the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightly coloured, playfully equipped with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object seems fairytale relaxed and invites to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Washneck, who dedicates himself preferably to the event in three dimensional letters 15 years K & G.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
In the middle of the race, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windplay Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be viewed until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday.
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
At the time, the Albachteners also made their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should no longer be a life in the district.
In the meantime it has become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they gave birth to MGV 68 Albachte.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It's going to be full today", Chairman Jürgen Holnachten guessed, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachter singers.
They had revived the Foundation Festival for their own anniversary.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
The traditional festival was back on time for the 50th anniversary.
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothing before.
The guests did not sit as usual in the "Haus der Begegnung" in rows of seats, but rather comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was required: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottlin drew the knobs and asked for the dance floor.
It was a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten made their voice heard.
The occasion was accompanied by cheerful songs.

The ladies' choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
Finally, there was poetry.

The ascendant marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring finds itself quite right in league three.
No trace of shui or breaks of fracture, the independents do their job.
And that is good for 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city rival BW Aasee.
"This was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied '; on the contrary.
In the evening at a later birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the atmosphere was good, the game hacked.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third sentence the guests had a football set.
"When they get to the finish line, a game like this can turn off", Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its skilled forces and brought the full yield to the target.
"We all know who is on the other side in such a Derby.
This is not a problem for us.
I saw good volleyball at times, "Annacker didn't complain with the 0: 3 and went straight to the agenda.
After just three days of the match, it does not seem to be possible to see where the journey for the independents goes.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball, "they don't want to look down into the fourth league any more.
If the West is not tainted in the next few weeks, they must look up.
However, an initial assessment can only be made after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband.
Heide Keller became a star on the "dream ship".
Now she speaks openly that the series may have had a share of the blame for her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Heide Keller (76) made her famous role as Chief Hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Traumschiff", but on January 1, 2018 she dropped out forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many colleagues that I admired saw me on eye level, "Keller tells in conversation with the" picture on Sunday ".
At first she was always only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
For now, the journalists have been calling only to Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much".
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans shunned talks about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be the only "right" for Hans von Borsody and he wanted to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in plain English: I have lost myself "as she continues to explain.
She always felt "not to be good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which in reality I never was, even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever ".
After a failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong again".
On the day before the civil wedding I sat in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never went with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I have approached love far too naively '.
The night hawker, who regularly explores the city ’ s nightlife at NZZ resort Zurich, ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our Falter is not a moth, but a bit light-shy.
And the glare, in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-pillar square, fades it too much.
But it's all about the film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the headlights.
So on this late Thursday evening he torches over the square to make a short break in the "Aquaclean-WC oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet facility, which is sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the needs-centre in the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to provide a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, the men's oasis stinks to the sky for some reason.
So out here, over the other street side: geladen guests who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the festival start as every year with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as you know, the works shown are from all over the world.
What do you not need to think of in an article about this festival in order not to become bogged down in surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies? the.,, and.,,, and..,,, and.
The Falter binds itself to a little brooch around the antennas, which has a good fairy for him, and two bully doorstewards actually wave him in generously.
Drinks are packed, they dance far after midnight to live music or can be set by DJ rhythms to which they beat each other and rinse with Cüpli exquisite appetizers.
In the souterrain delicatessen, oysters await slip mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut up, a chocolate fountain is bubbling.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves of fully exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without any big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The Falter studies the sign at the escalator: "wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has missed the dress code.
But it is more of a conditioning construction, and it has certainly saved lives already.
In the housekeeping department on the upper floor the poultry kicks a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not necessarily determined by the mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting this brand for years, is not here this evening either.
However, between local prominence, cash desk and kitchen articles, a face passes by, which the observer is familiar with: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor is probably not far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, soon sixty almost like a chorister, walks through the crowd retroactively.
It is not being quashed, it is not being nurtured, and at most it is being stealt.
International stars of this film festival love this reticence, often misunderstood as being tangled.
Maradona celebrates Mexico ’ s Victory with Cumbia Tänzchen
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina's soccer legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home country Mexico.
After a 2: 0 victory by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as shown in a video already released on Saturday.

After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my guys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: League of Associations 1: ASV Sending after last minute bankruptcy "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, Coach of the handball association ASV Senden, couldn't believe it: "Such a bitter defeat".
As in Steinhagen, like against Hülhorst, they did not play badly over long periods, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we were completely sleepy", annoyed the ASV trainer.
The owners quickly managed with 8: 1, even the early time-out that Bieletzki had taken did not at first bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a rucksack went through the team", Bieletzki summarized the second quarter of an hour.
For the break, the backlog was only two goals.
In particular, Sennn ’ s Beast, Marius Hintze, met each time in the phase.
After the change it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst started the 15: 15, then the Staffelchanger ran almost completely.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Invite the non-partisan to the action.
Bieletzki is usually wary of blaming others.
But: The 120-second penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and met four times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys fought great, stood well at the back against seven men and threw them back to the empty goal.
But they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damned victory has to be made", says the fully operated Bieletzki.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Frau has been missing for 30 years - Police are digging in shreds.
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (district of Hof), the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday, armed forces took a street with Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the street floor and several layers were removed, as the police and the public prosecutor shared.
New evidence suggests that the missing may have been buried not far from where they lived.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
At the time, the investigators did not rule out a crime.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working intensively with the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monuments Protection Agency, the investigators encountered a delinquency under the road with Marxgr by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, officials limited the job to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking in the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, even if it doesn't hurt to provide antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent recall as head of the billionaire company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) extrajudicially filed a lawsuit against misleading Twitter news, in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk gives the chair for three years, a position comparable to that of the German board chairman.
He may remain CEO.
In the comparison, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla committed wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world ’ s famous manager for fraud in Manhattan.
Musk, also headed by SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electro-car pioneer, now valued on the stock exchange at more than $50 billion.
Musk Knows No Debt
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share that the funding was secured.
That would have put Tesla at a total of $72 billion.
Later, Musk reversed: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an outside chairman, appoint two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk ’ s communication.

Shortly before the end Sturridge reds the Reds with a Schlenzer to the angle.
Manchester United, a record player, has slipped deeper and deeper into the crisis after the worst season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United with 1: 3 (0: 2) and remains only in the table middle field with ten points after seven days.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League match on Tuesday against FC Valencia.
The former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League match after a violation of Petr Cech.
Before the 1899 Hoffenheim Champions League match on Tuesday, Manchester City won by goals of Raheem Sterling (29) and Sergio Agüero (65) 2: 0 against Brighton & Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1: 0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used by the new leader.

Polls: 46% don ’ t want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
After the squabbles of the past few weeks, GroKo receives several poll wins.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey – Merkel is critical.
Berlin - Die AfD hat die SPD im Emnid-Sonntagsztrend für die Bild am Sonntag nationwide erstmalig überprüft.
In the weekly poll conducted by the Opinion Research Institute, the AfD stands at 17%, the SPD scores a point compared to the previous week and ends at 16%.
The CDU and the CSU also lose a counter and only get 27%.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15%, the left 11% and the FDP 10%.
If the federal election on Sunday were to be held, the ruling parties SPD, CDU, and CSU together would receive only 43% of the vote, according to Emnid.
As a result, the grand coalition has now lost the majority in all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach, on Sunday.
The governing parties receive a total of 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
Together, they received 53.4% of the federal election in 2017.
The other parties also have a broad spectrum: the AfD, the second-strongest party in several polls, comes to 15-18%.
The Greens have a voting share of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left averages 10%, and the FDP is 9%.
For statistical reasons, depending on the proportion of votes, such surveys have an uncertainty of between 2 and 3% upwards and downwards.
But popular support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen significantly since the federal election in 2017.
At the moment, only 48% of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the chancellor ’ s office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of BamS revealed.
Only one in two (50%) currently wants the grand coalition to hold in three years until the next regular federal election, 41% for a new election.
Another poll published on Saturday showed a significant drop in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans are also partly assessing whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
According to this, 64% of the candidates for membership of the Union wish to stand for election, 35% do not.
Aldi's Lookout: Reduced in Love
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic getting-to-know stories - should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co. the supermarket as an acquaintance place for great love almost radiates an anachronistic romanticism.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer bargains at the table or the favorite pudding is, in doubt, still a better story for the future grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The App Tinder is reputed to be a slippery stock exchange rather than a contact stock.
We dared the test: How do women react, not to talk about the bush in the first news?
Here is the amazing result.
Normal Hollywood Lovestory-Potential occurs when a plot precedes the happiness of love.
If the guy then sends his name to Bio-putenmein @ gmx.de, it sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and his associates - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this advertisement in an Aldi branch that we are not familiar with is very much to be hoped that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
For her belief in the magic of analogue acquaintance she certainly deserves her happy end à la Hollywood.

"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen, "Fetsch praised his guys and searched each individual for the match, simply to say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca came to Rehberg for him - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had significantly more shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his departure (17), the incoming Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38) missed the lead.
The SCA almost took revenge when, in minute 41, the SCA went up twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker caste - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, VfL took full control.
This was the first time in the history of the island.
Also Schroer came late after 58 minutes at a Thewes-Herinung.
With the intervention of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect kiss for the placemakers 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The Founder himself joined and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhues "Thing with the right slag struck down left from the point of view of the shooter - 1: 0 (71).
20 minutes still that should be damn long.
And then that: VfL-Captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty room at the 80th minute unfortunate.
referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive in the closing phase before Geske had the victory on the push in the 87th minute from twelve metres.
Perhaps it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes.

Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on corporate boards.
As a result, only 8% of the board members were women on the cut-off date of 1 September, as indicated in the report entitled "The Power of Monoculture", which was officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was previously available to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to establish themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them by," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Anchsen.
In the US, the United Kingdom, or Sweden, purely male leadership teams – with few exceptions – are far from conceivable.
In comparison, the backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking.
It is a different business culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses among the companies in the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8% of boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
The proportion of women in the 30 Dax companies - which has been at the forefront in recent years - has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women in the coming year - in their own interest," said Anchorsen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the proportion of "zero percent" to date.
Another picture is the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Recruiting just as many women each year for the boards would have reached 40% in 2023," says the report.
Some even make a corse: luxury carcasses: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves best.
The Italians enter 280,000 euros with every Ferrari sold and profit 69,000 euros.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble suppliers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers get per car they sell?
This question has been addressed by "Autotap" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöfer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made 69,000 Euro operating profit with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only gets around 800 Euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are at an average price of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros earnings before interest and taxes EBIT well in the race.

On Saturday afternoon, the 46-year-old driver of the notary ’ s hospital had crossed a red traffic light with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then met a taxi crossing near the green.
After the collision, the car hurled against an ampel mast and a tree.
In the same year, he took over the Passantin, which still died at the site of the accident.
Notary and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62 year old taxi driver and the emergency car driver were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from duty forces.
The doctor, who was also seriously injured 29 years ago, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another summoned notary tried this - but without success.
The three serious injuries were brought to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor, are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we ’ re Unlucky
After the humiliating defeat in the Liacup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1: 3. The manner of defeat is likely to give further talk.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute when the newly recovered Marko Arnautovic shot 3: 1 for West Ham, only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly brought the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an offside in Mark Nobel ’ s pass, all Manchester defensive players remained standing, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously largely inadequate performance.
The mood at United ’ s city congress Manchester City is very different at the moment.
The citizens, trained by Mourinho ’ s major competitor Pep Guardiola, came to an approximate 2: 0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke down the outsider ’ s defensive belt for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer Table Leaders
Three days after the 1: 2 defeat in the League, Xherdan Shaqiri fought 1: 1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the Cup Out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old hit in the 25th minute remained the only match in the game until the end.
Shaqiri, who hit the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After Reds started the week with a flawless balance sheet, Chelsea was out for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp ’ s team in the Cup, with Remis in the League toppling the blues Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, London ’ s two city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2: 0 victories.
Gunners' fans, for whom Granit Xhaka played, had to wait for the surprise team from County Hertfordshire until the 81st minute for a success story.
Nine minutes before the end, the Watford defender Craig Cathcart debuted an entry by Alex Iwobi unhappy into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
Arsenal passed Watford with the fifth consecutive victory and is now immediately behind the great rival Tottenham in fifth place.
The Wolves remained in the league at 2: 0 against Southampton for the fifth time in a row and ranked 8th.
Volkswagen ’ s core brand is missing: the Paris Motor Show in the Fuel Debate
The Paris Automobile Salon takes place every two years with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject, yet ubiquitous: the diesel scandal and the fight for bans and upgrades should not leave German car manufacturers at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their new products from next week together with competitors from all over the world in the French capital.
Diesel does not play a major role in this.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, will nevertheless be an important topic, at least behind the shining scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the Volkswagen brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and among other things have their first pure electric models: the e-tron of Ingolstadt is due to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But both have already been officially presented.
The iNext from BMW should not start until 2021.
The new 3er is at the centre of Paris.
More than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car manufacturers, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The exhibition, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died in the severe earthquakes and the subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
Two earthquakes struck the island on Friday.
The first earthquake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport links have been damaged and enormous material damage has been caused.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu hundreds had gathered on the beach for a celebration.
There is a fear that the number of victims will continue to rise significantly.
The numbers so far only come from Palu.
Many other communities - along Sulawesi's west coast - are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl.
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the engine pastor within the Westphalian Evangelical Church and is therefore responsible for the pastoral care of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September the traditional MoGo service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of the month at the house Nordbright.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season at the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, around 150 bikers met on Sunday to celebrate anything but normal service.
Already at 10 o'clock the Bolids were placed in front of the entrance of the church.
At first, the biker ’ s early floats were on the agenda and it could be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a hearty currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, there were also the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was held during the Biker service priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical support.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic-quiet," says the pastor Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday.
Beachtarfer Heimatverein celebrates a big festival: after the apple comes the milk.
Borisch was also active at the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his bag and gradually demonstrated to his astonished audience the process from the ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle power the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how to turn this into a tasty drink.
However, they were also able to take a look at this important step forward this late Friday afternoon.
packed in shapes and wrapped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little bit like a Häckgelgood-looking apple piece layer on top of each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the Füchtor farmer also had already completed specialities.
He opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather white to older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchdorf" was correspondingly great.
In a cosy atmosphere the parents met together, while the children could not only follow the process of pressing the apple, but also discovered the built bouncer for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorfer Cameraljaft former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games.
In the coming year, the Heimatverein will also offer a day of action.
But then, as Gregor Krüttzkamp pointed out, the home house in the heart of the Savings Bank will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the issue: after all, the milk will be around.
1: 4 versus Frankfurt: Hannover, with its fourth season bust: "Cause situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter met his disappointed pros of Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, there were many positive things not seen before at 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It is a cunning situation, but you have to come out as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and shot down: "That is, of course, disappointing, because you always think a lot".
The further winners of Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslim (86) met, stand at the bottom with two meters and are in their current constitution a relegation candidate.
Led by the towering Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated its first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) won the goals for the DFB Cup winner before 46,300 spectators, who scored seven points in the middle of the table after the successful general test for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome.
Croatia ’ s Vice-World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive by the Hessen and never got under control of Hanover ’ s defence.
The striker, long after the World Cup, showed with his speed and perseverance why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, hired by Liverpool FC, was the first time in the opening formation of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which began with enthusiasm.
A headball intercepted on the Tornet by Lucas Torró (17) was the first to pose a threat.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position, was stopped at the last moment by the 96-defense against the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-lived Kevin Wimmer (back).
Leaders were almost inevitable and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty room after a broken corner, Haller extended per head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga squad for the French second league player AJ Auxerre, who came in the summer.
And Frankfurt followed before the break.
This time Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully refueled his way through and 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser didn ’ t get a chance.
In the half-time Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his team and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although Lower Saxony now played a little bolder forward, pioneering ideas remained until just before the end, when the final meeting was still successful.
Hessen were much more efficient.
After less than an hour Rebic started a solo and then placed right across De Guzmán, who had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only a show run for the Frankfurt people against overcharged guests, Jovic also met one minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square Goes to Party Mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
Dieter Reiter, the mayor of Munich, managed to attract millions at the opening of the 185.
Munich's Wies'n last week with two hits.
Geisinger: Geisinger Christen feieren Heiligen-Kreuz-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Heiligen-Kreuz-Fest on September 14 or Sunday thereafter.
The festive service takes place in the town church, then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the dead Christ, who came from the 30-year war and who according to legend was shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood then flowed out of the sore wound.,,,, and., and.
This led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the altar is standing, the missing Langhaus is hinted by the trees.
In his sermon pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, of comfort and of life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Despite the importance of the Geisinger Parish, the service was poorly attended.
After the divine service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the Holy Cross ended.
For many years the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting to the secular part of the festival to the Catholic Parish House.
The members of the choir provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish community, informed visitors about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the construction work that is to be done, which will continue to be carried out until next year.
Since the scaffolding has been around for some time, it has been possible to establish the damage more precisely and to prepare the individual tenders more specifically.
What is certain is that renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has increased, but more has been discovered, which was only made possible by using scaffolding.
The socle protection work is finished, the natural stone work is to be started before the winter, and it is hoped that we will be able to complete half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New Home in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in Münsterblickstraße now a very special house will be handed over to its purpose - there were all those present at the time of the inauguration.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residential home of the life aid Donau-Iller for some time already depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account the concept of wide corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was put to the test for the inhabitants of Handycap: "The house had come into the years and had become outdated in its equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the diggers advanced to demolish the house.
The new building should be as bright and friendly as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller Eröffnung neuer Wohnheim
About EUR 4.6 million was invested in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The gap between a barrier-free and fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and artisans had set up a home with the many guidelines that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, the head of the Swabian Social Administration, said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile".
As Kreutmayer said, the housing and functionality were well combined.
And again: "The property in this position is a real stroke of luck because it is no longer available in the present situation".
Altogether, the new residential home in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square metres, divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Sweeping laments differences between East and West
Berlin - On the eve of the Day of Unity, the Deputy Federal Chairman of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all countrymen not to settle for discrimination against East Germans.
There are differences that, after nearly 30 years, hurt unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania at the" Tagesspiegel am Sonntag ".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germany worked longer, on average, than West Germany ’ s people, but received 15% less.
"I cannot explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this clean dog stop the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan hunting dog should smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae a present in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday, the two dogs about a year old reached their destination on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food in order to make it easier for the animals to "weave".
The dogs with the thick white coat, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced its commitment to friendship at this year ’ s third summit between Moon and North Korea ’ s leader, Kim Jong-un, in mid-September in Pyongyang.
Both countries also agreed to compete in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and jointly apply for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the process, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines.,,, and the,.
Austria ’ s Warming History in Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
To mark the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for nearly ten months now, numerous new books have been published, mostly in retrospect to the last hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, does it differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New Week, New Chance for the Government
Back to the work of the substance - that is the unofficial motto of the Great Coalition's working week, which is beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, the SPD and also from the CSU did not, in the last instance, summon the "return to the work of Sakharov" in a mantra.
This may have led some artisans, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in that country to the legitimate question of what actually is the difference between work and work, but so be it.
When the Federal Government is ready to return to its task of governing, it should not be stopped by discussing terms now.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do anything together after the provocations and bubbles of recent weeks may be demonstrated by Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties come together to the coalition committee.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflict early, a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, the issue of diesel upgrades and the law on the transfer of skilled labour is once again on the list. of,,,,,,, and.
The CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car manufacturers to get off scot-free with conversion premiums, and the SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as being obliged to retrofit older diesel.
While a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the EU and the SPD are still far apart in the planned trade immigration law.
The SPD calls for a permanent perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strongly opposed to the 'change of track' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be disputes between the coalition partners - and how else should it be?
It is not the same thing that the GroKo has joined forces, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society drawn from such diverse and sometimes conflicting interests will not progress.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be broken up again for party political reasons on the question of being or not.
It is still about politics, not about theater.
The Union and the SPD are supposed to fight - but always keep in mind the reality of life.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both diesel and track change issues can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
That is what the parties must fight for now.
Pilz Checks Working Time for Hartinger
Minister in Target
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, violate the law of service?
Daniela Holzinger will take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" would have their legislatures worked on social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
Daniela Holzinger's Liste-Pilz-Mandatorin is surprised by the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question.
They assume that 'the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and in no way to announce violations of the current law of service in front of cameras'.
Nevertheless, she now has questions to "free Har ­ tinger from any suspicion".
Police are tearing up a street in search of women ’ s bodies.
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
There is now confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The track is closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday.
It was preceded by the investigators who had previously used a archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, was able to limit the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomalie has been discovered in the area of the street in question, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority.
For more than a year now, the Public Prosecutor and the Criminal Police Court have been working on the case of missing persons.
Again and again a cycle path has been closed to Marxgr and studied with sonars, because investigators suspect that Heike ’ s body could have been buried here as the state road was rebuilt 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Riyves in Barcelona before Catalonia ’ s anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But there are ties before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalonia ’ s security forces were attacked by pro-independence campaigners, including color powder, in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and Civil Guard.
Some 3000 police officers of the National Police and the Civil Guard wanted to honour their colleagues in a rally last year in the polling stations that were deemed illegal.
Violence also occurred at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the roughly 6,000 separatists, however, would have been violent in attempting to break the police chain and, among other things, canvassing officials with paint bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were easily injured, as the authorities said.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid forced Catalonia to be administered in the fall of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also resigned abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers from the then regional government and other separatist activists are still in U-prison.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration ended.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
FC Gütersloh (FC Gütersloh) and RW Ahlen (FC Gütersloh) play in the Bundesliga.
Red White Ahlen continues on the spot.
The FC Gütersloh won only a 0: 0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidemwaldstadion, they turned out to be a general helplessness.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst could not worry about this.
There was no danger of missing a goal chance, because there were virtually none.
First Shot after Half an Hour
Freightsloh Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility was the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westernerling was forced into a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the prison limits.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Serious Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mürtzel was aiming at just over the housing from 18 meters, and after one hour the freight sloters also appeared offensive for the first time.
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz it went fix.
Nick Flock (62) crowned the quickly performed Konter over Sinan Aygün with a soft shot into the arms of Bernd Schipmann, the RWA commissioner.
In addition, they played Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mürtzel (70).
It did - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve anything more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but also that did not get anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero was in front of the.
"This time we were not as torhazardous as we were against wooden windings and that even though our opponent had no desire to play here", stated RW Ahlen's interim trainer.
Offensively "all of this smashed a bit" against a team that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not feel that we could get an opposite, "Daut said.
Unfortunately, as a spectator, one did not feel that his team could score a goal.
The idea was too feeble.
Reckenfeld Harvest Market: Luckily enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table dispenser, for which these donations are intended.
The Honorary Assemblies: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky was shining blue, but the square was still a little empty, but that should change in the course of the day.
Because: "Here it is so nice to socialise, so we are here today," one visitor said.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holhouse welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent dose of humour.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer quickly intervened for Brockmann, who was supposed to be balanced against food.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) became ill.
But there are enough chalmers.
And the "replacement" could not take it away to entertain the increasingly growing visitors in between musically.
This was so good that at a late hour some folk songs were sung.
"Just great", Marcel Kreimer was happy.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is happy about the many activities with their stands, mostly clubs.
"Actually there should be no such thing as a table at all," he thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who were in use at the booths and included the other festivals that took place in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden town has a colourful coat of paint - here you can do something.
Then the Maikraz of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was taken off with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the Winterquartier.
Many booths were used for bodily well-being.
From sweetness to heart detention was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has been living in Reckenfeld for only a year, has been creative at his decompression saw.
He offered veneer works, coasters with reckenfields motives and a lot more.
Three reckenfields of beekeepers offered a specialty: "Reckenfeld Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschslu.
The latter has another speciality.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, so good the cake tasted.
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage programme that does not exist during the autumn festival.
Lubrications with a local-policy message: No Successful Advertising for a Skate Plant
In Len, unknowns have hardly promoted the construction of a skatepark.
In several places, according to Jürgen Kohne of the City Council at the TN ’ s request, there are appropriate lubrications.
In at least one case, the police have been charged with property damage.
The three words "Skatepark für Len!" are written in large letters on signs at the Gempt-Halle and at the Alte Rathaus (Old Town Hall).
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that an appropriate inscription has already been discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro after the trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an Edding, it was easy to remove it.
"A few days later, however, this was back, this time sprayed up", says Rottmann.
It assumes that the appropriate advertising sign must be replaced.
This case is particularly marked by the fact that several large companies are also called Len on the blackboard.
If the skatepark is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
Promises already exist, explained Jörg Hesselmann of the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies on the receiving board.
For years, local politics and administration have been working on the subject of skatepark.
After the old one had been mined at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the majority of the Council was in favour of the fire parking lot.
However, this request has not been made - too many factors seem to have spoken out against building here.
A U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the General and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
As far as the state of affairs is concerned, Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then has the city council.
He assumes a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Closing Air Traffic
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no sign of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have a strong wind and then the storm comes," said Matthias Maas, head of the Air Navigation Union, the German Press Agency, ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
One important reason for the many delays and flight cancellations is the long-established staffing shortage of European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but training for new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
The market for pre-trained pilots should be empty across Europe.
Just in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace, there were around a hundred people missing.
Maas again criticised the fact that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal government, countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work densification and overtime, this will not be possible without us," explained the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German Air Traffic Administration.
Maas again blamed EU Commission guidelines for pilotage.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings in national air safety schemes are now taking full advantage of the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that 'do not cut off air traffic further'.
At the moment, EU targets would be agreed by 2024 and there is a risk of further tightening.
The EU is under constant pressure from airlines to lobby.
"Michael O'Leary, Ryanair CEO and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high cost of delay on the part of airlines will lead to a change.
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if the German Air Traffic Administration (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
The announcement to date that 120 pilot students will be admitted every year over the next five years is sufficient to compensate for the absences due to age.
The necessary staff building is not yet connected.
ThyssenKrupp ’ s Supervisory Board Votes for Group Restoration
The members of the ThyssenKrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of ThyssenKrupp Interim Chairman Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at Sunday ’ s meeting, the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is to be split into two separate companies.
Both companies shall be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no further reduction in staffing beyond the administrative cuts already known.
After two resignations, the control panel counts only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken at the Annual General Meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50% share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrias AG, the business with lifts and suppliers is to be bundled.
Barcelona: violence in demos of police and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations in Barcelona by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence campaigners have led to violent clashes with many injured.
According to the city council, on Saturday around 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered, as did some 6,000 pro-independence protesters.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protest movements out of each other with a big band.
But, according to the forces, pro-independence campaigners repeatedly tried to break the safety gap.
They would have attacked officials with paint and bullets.
According to the figures, there were also differences between the participants in the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and pay for colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to those colleagues who fought almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Civil Guard find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators saw it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona, of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to give his name only with Daniel, dismissed the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year only did their duty: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights, and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues "did not come to provoke", the policeman asserted.
Panne allowed access to British ministers ’ personal data

Football: Juve Trainer Praises for Top Game: Ronaldo ’ s Best Game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best match this evening together with the half hour of Valencia", praised Jude-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3: 1 (1: 1) victory of the record master against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the heavily bought star was the decisive man in the important match against the tracker even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had much fun and makes it good," said Allegra.
Although we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
In the end, Juve was able to play the game with the help of Ronaldo's three goalhands, with the of Dries Mertens (10 minutes) and suspended from the.
Real Madrid ’ s goalkeeper, Mario Mandzukic, was a former Bundesliga pro, who took the lead with a double pack (26 / 49).
And Ronaldo did the groundwork for the hit of Bonucci (76), who had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals of the attacker who is the record defender in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With Ronaldo ’ s purchase of more than €100 million, Juventus ’ overpower seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series A. At 21 points, the master of the past seven years has already six meters ahead of Naples.
The second table, trained by former coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the previous Mario Rui (58th) refused to take place, the top team was determined.
The Portuguese had to get in against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square after getting in.
"We played well against a good Naples", commented the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was able to feel talked about.
The German national player won Juve.
The professional who came from Liverpool FC was in action with all seven league games.
The midfield player also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown out of the place with the 2: 0 victory of the Turin people and was closed to the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West Changing Its Name
Rapper Kanye West made a special appearance at the US TV show Saturday Night Live at the weekend.
Among other things, his performance together with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused eyebrows and question marks to the audience.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From then on, he can only be called "Ye", according to the musician.
"The essence of what used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted along the lines of the late Prince, when he derived his artist name.
The pseudonym is not news, however.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with radio station KRL, the artist explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most frequently used word in the Bible and there it means" you ", according to the rapper.
Football: Circular League A1 Münster: Finally!
Create!
Hoetmar ’ s trainer Average made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was just more at hand, we almost never put him into trouble ".
Grade two goal chances in 90 minutes, this rarely makes games positive.
Football Circuit League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sennhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) photo: Heinz Schweckenberg.
Even the SG had only two possibilities in the first pass, the first but used Maik Krause from a pointed angle to the early guidance (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preparatory work he agreed to stand freely.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when Moritz Höne, Torsteuer Jos Schuhmacher, failed and Jan Blome, who was the last member of the broadcaster, also found his master.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all gave in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the doorway and saw red for it - also Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75).
Only when Nils Berheide stoked the ball over the line was the game decided (81).
"We had criticised ourselves hard before, but that was different today than in the last few weeks", was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sennhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Gates: 0: 1 Krause (7), 0: 2 Berheide (81).
Red card: Kortenjann (75 / Hoetmar).
Football: Regional League A2 Münster: Spectacle Football in Albeighth: GW Albersloh is Concordia with 3: 4.
"I don't know what to think of it," he prayed for words.
"We don't have access to them at all," he probably meant the wing length with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites with a collective offensive drive.
He was able to laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, "cheeky and cheeky, and attracted by danish players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Remember, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albahten, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for the class preservation.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0: 2, how we stand against one of the league's top teams over the entire game time, that was really phenomenal".
All the more bitter the fact that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goalier Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season event (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He placed the 2: 0 exemplary on the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you cannot take a player out of it completely.
"That was madness, what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of his opponent's jealously.
Shortly before the side change, his own team made the difference: McGill ’ s free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia ’ s orbiter Hinkerohe through to the long Toreck (45th).
After the side change it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a fast, action-packed game.
In the early days of his career, Horstmann returned to England, where he worked as a consultant to the Royal Navy.
Albersloh was able to beat the last Concordia match (80th) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against cheating, that's what we must win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangeberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Gates: 1: 0 Zymner (24), 2: 0 Fröhning (39), 2: 1 McGill (45.), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 Nübel (64.), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow Red: Atalan (74th / Albachten).

Tutzing Gospel Academy: Prominent Guests and New Offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he will personally collect the price of tolerance in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term was too short: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was there.
This is how the academic director Udo Hahn calculated him when he proudly said: "All Federal presidents and chancellors were already with us".
At the end of October Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective. On September 29, the writer Frido Mann will attend a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to receive the "tolerance prize" he received from the Academy personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives TV presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The 80 or so sessions by mid-2019 are in themselves.

Music Cabaret: Heart of Gender Understanding - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As cabarettestin, Teubner imagined gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (perceived) woman and man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
The mini-guitar set her in and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süskub sat at the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to words even to the end of the sentence, and on the other a true pianist: so congenially accompanied by Süschub Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
This was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, in the way it fit the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought into play a paradox: the man ’ s satisfaction comes when he has a partner, but does not open the door.
A closed door without partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano piano piano piano now demonstrates the same: What would have arisen from Mozart's composing had "the Nannerl" unexpectedly opened the door?
In this way, atonement glides over into improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" to the "Lied von Tod", and from Mozart g-Moll's Symphony into a playful dance.
There were great applause and 'bravo' from the full Chamber.
Flowers were handed over to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
But Heidemarie Markenbeck, Chairman of the Board, did not accept any additional thanks.
She had the idea to treat the duo to Wolbeck alongside appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Women's League: Ahlener SG keeps the white slate against TV Wattenscheid.
They had problems with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"Actually I was happy with the defense, only one player did too many goals.
We did not get them under control ', says ASG Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry about the many missed opportunities.
His final focus was missed this time.
The ASG therefore lagged behind almost to the end, at 11: 12 and later at 15: 18 (45).
It was only towards the end that the broader bank of hosts made a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu placed Merle Klement back on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).

In the second league relegator VC Allbau Essen the blue whites won with 3: 1.
"This was a huge step for a cool season.
Lenz plays in the upper third of the league.
This is what we have been working on, "coach Dominik Münch was happy to see his team perform almost flawless with the shortened leader of the table.

The hotel is very close to the city centre.
We have occupied them well.
Our adversary received a high risk ticket, as well as several tickets.
In the second sentence the BSV already stated at 12: 8 "Essen has changed the assumption to triple bars.
We were unable to keep up the pressure of publicity.
Eating was not easy, and we let ourselves be lulled a bit, "Münch continued.
At 18: 17 the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their nose ahead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern still fought four batches at 19: 24, the fifth attempt nevertheless found its goal.

Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet from 14: 16 to 25: 21.

International: Turkish Municipality: Mosche-Mosche-Opening as a Lost.: in of in. from to....
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the Great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the Moschee in Cologne has left a pile of tatters in German-Turkish relations that can only be restored with difficulty," said the Chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the opportunity to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of underlining Muslims' membership of Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The extensive exclusion of the German public has' reinforced many reservations'.

After the long summer break is finally Folktreffen time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the local association Nottuln is already hosting its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Old Amtmannei.
It was almost a year ago that we had a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottlin ", is pleased Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottlner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our Folk meeting was so quickly published in Nottlin.
No matter if Stormdeep Friederike in January or heatwave in July, the chimney room of the Amtmannei was always full.
"The programme for the next Folk Meeting is, as always, a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old percussion", says Karl-Heinz Steverer, who is always a friendly musician to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer promised his accordion for the first "Birthday".
He was a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from the neighbouring group Steinfurt, who played music with plattGerman lyrics.
Now he is on his way with an irish brass band.
The makers of the Folk Meeting are happy to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten enthused the audience with his international version of the song "Frösche am Nacht" and sent them home with an ear worm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend yet another social and funny evening", says the invitation of the Heimatverein.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to participate actively is invited to participate.

From pure fruit production to ecology
A gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle celebrated the 125-year anniversary of the district association for horticulture and maintenance.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit-show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus set the final impetus for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
At the time, however, he was called another: as "district fruit farm association Kulmbach Stadt und Land", he was baptized by mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the association was also different from today's work - in fact it was only about fruit cultivation, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
"At that time, in the time of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites," explained district carers Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees should border roads, so called industrial gardens were created in schools.
The fruit cultivation is still the job of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural gardening, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an important role, as well as teaching knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Maulbrecken" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important nature experiences are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge issue for us children, I doubt that you can gather just as much joy with smartphone & co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides", added Landrat Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The Regional Association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt about the fact that the district managing director and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He guided the many visitors through the long history of the district association and reported among other things about the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came from the garden, for the winter it was dosed in.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has continued, it was already there before us and we have to follow it", the expert argued for fruit and nut trees.
That is why the horticultural associations are encouraged not to let up in order to keep our home beautiful and worth living.
The President of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl, has also welcomed the new citizens in our clubs.
"We must stop the glaring decline in insects, we owe that to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony which was solemnly framed by the tower brass of the music association Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta Talks: Canada ’ s Foreign Minister Released UN Speech
Mexico ’ s government wants clarity on Nafta: it gives both trading partners an ultimatum to reach an agreement.
Canada's Secretary of State is now giving absolute priority to the trade agreement - postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the United Nations General Debate in New York because of the timescale of the struggle to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the US and Mexico.
Instead of speaking this Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, its spokesman, Adam Austen, told the Minister.
Meanwhile, they are focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexico ’ s Minister of Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, said on Friday that Canadian and US negotiators would have 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August to rewrite the NAFTA.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks on a new version have been going on for more than a year.
They are now to be concluded by Sunday evening (local time), and Trump ’ s government wants to submit the deal to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a breakdown in the negotiations, Mexico ’ s president-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a trade show attack, has left the hospital.
The extreme right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked in the open streets in early September during a campaign event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in English: "Der nicht") women's associations in particular called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations against Bolsonaros used racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In Brazil, the protests mixed with a rally by the Brazilian Workers ’ Party ’ s presidential candidate, Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As the former mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in politics, but is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach an absolute majority in the first round of the elections, there will be a run-off on October 28.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully, no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for his incitement against homosexuals and blacks and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Time and again he is shocked by verbal derailments.
On another occasion, he said that the supporters of Lula ’ s left-wing Workers ’ Party should be shot dead.

After Long Disease: Danish Rock Legend Death
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children on his deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen became known with the band Gasolin ', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's dissolution in 1978, Larsen was a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the most sold album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen acknowledged Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that Larsen, the monarchie opponent, had appeared in 2010 at the 70th anniversary of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.

After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all together with the booking-agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands are clearly enthralling the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" -Rocknacht.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince with the latest, unknown pieces by his own pen and the upcoming CD at the start of.
In front of the stage, the band is danced to create a harmonious and powerful interplay.
Although "encore" is not to be missed, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock. Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierheinrich demonstrate on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes classical rock sounds of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is also used on "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only does the longing, almost ballade-like "Take Me Home" captivate by the change from melodic passages to the guitar heavy rock riffs of the complex songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuchen has, however, since its foundation in 2005 gained a special reputation.
On Saturday the band will present their hardrock full of agility.
The special stage experience of "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitar player Tim Jungmann, in cooperation with the band, also sets a special emphasis on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a joyful solo to the sound that feels even higher than before, while he runs through the audience.
A certain volume of noise is naturally part of this hardrock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to the Mischpull Team, the triple concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, the pressing air hammers level, but it is still significantly lower than the "Wacken-designed", which "The Ignition" refers to on its website.
On this rock night, however, the Ahlen audience does not need to be stunned by 120 decibels in jet drive strength as is the case with the annual metal statement in the north of the republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone coffins and have ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger", all three groups can say at the end, albeit in a figurative sense.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

Trump awes Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that North Korea ’ s leader, Kim, is well disposed despite the nuclear crisis.
But Trump has now made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president declared himself a new flame.
The tragedy: it is a distant relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump publicly made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Supporters in West Virginia found Trump almost vengeful words for the half-year-old sprout of Pyongyang ’ s ruling synagogue, though it turns out to be rather tough in fighting for North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament.
“I was tough, he was tough, and we went back and forth, ” Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it is not only talks with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump pointed to Kim ’ s announcement that all nuclear and missile tests will stop, even though critics have seen little more than lip service.
The US president seemed well aware that the affection for whether his notorious “Rocket Man ” – Trump ’ s nickname for Kim – might not be more cherished.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of this at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It is so presidential.
But he did not care much, Trump declared, and then pointed his finger at the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential."
But then we would not have 10 000 people out there in this crowded arena, only 200 people out there.
The Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler.
Baesweiler ’ s city centre was cleaned out on Sunday with a good shot of the Oktoberfest.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest was not only held in the marquee at the fire brigade, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Saved Refugees from Libya ’ s Prison by Video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to point out their catastrophic conditions of detention in Libya, thus enabling them to be rescued.
The group shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the site "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he said he was risking his life.
One of his comrades was beaten almost to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general terms, the conditions of detention were disastrous: 'They beat us all with pipes and sticks'.
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year through the program, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of Nigerians now rescued was not exceptional, given the poor conditions in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organisations have long criticised the situation in the Libyan refugee camps as degrading.
The North African state, dominated by militias to a large extent, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.

Lack of Trust in the US: North Korea Calls for Disarmament
While US President Trump never tire of emphasizing the success of negotiations on North Korea ’ s denuclearization, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a concession from Washington.
In the United Nations General Debate, North Korea ’ s Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapons-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The recent stalemate is due to the US relying on coercive measures that are lethal to confidence-building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable in these circumstances for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said North Korea's chief diplomat.
That punitive measures could 'bring North Korea to its knees' is' a pipe dream for people who do not know us'.
To build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, the US side did not react to this, and the minister criticised it.
Because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council adopted three sanctions last year alone against the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, have been pressing the United Nations for strict compliance with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working towards rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea ’ s leader, Kim Jong-un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks about ending North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT Serves: New Kitchen with Communal Donations
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting did not get anything of that to the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a big buffet waited for the guests after the harvest worship.
The young people of the HoT were enchanted by the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The organization was funded by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to express their gratitude.
The launch with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, Head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were perfectly prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power failure had put the huge two-part fridge out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from scratch: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And so everyone took part.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"You can't do better", praised a visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to eat quiches, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said priest Frank Beckmann, while magicians Stephan Lammen surprised with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board NRW der Tafel.

Sartor became famous throughout Germany because the Essen Tafel had introduced a ban on admission to foreigners.
He had already resigned as vice president of the NRW panels in July, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
Too many people have fallen behind me.
The head of the North Rhine-Westphalia Table Association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed sympathy with the dpa for the decision of his long-time deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - people have spoken out there who did not know exactly why the Essen Tafel did it".
Sartor is still active for the Essen Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes", says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday", Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels.
We must not adopt the approach of 'without us starving the people of the city'.
It was up to the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of panels on Friday in Berlin.
"I am told too much sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis, which criticised me at the time.

In the federal debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, on 30 June 2017, Kahr had caused a stir with a wave of rage.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having failed on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement by Günter Schabowski of the GDR border opening.

Hertha Bust: From Reality: Bayern vs. Ajax
The title is unbeatable: FC Bayern will not let the defeat in Berlin down.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate step for Niko Kovac ’ s term of office.
The first small performance of the new Coach Niko Kovac is not intended for the Munich ones to become a bigger autumn low.
"A week ago we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now the reality has caught us a bit ", Thomas Müller noted after his deserved 0: 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that we are really annoyed by this and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year out no own goal was scored, as at the same time the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory, the table leadership in the Bundesliga was lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall picture is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti in late September 2017, but the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its running intensive mann-on-man tactics and the Berliner with their playful needle-stick over the outside delivered two blueprints within three days, just like the last overpowering Bavaria are to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to make it happen again," said Kovac.
But he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native town, and his first defeat as a Munich coach merely pushed for the anew flawed management of opportunity.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim answer of his term of office positive before the country break - otherwise the tone will probably get worse.
For example, Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second premier class appearance of this season after Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which at the start of AEK Athens also had a sovereign defeat with 3: 0.
"Now we are caught in two matches, but we will also be making our gates again," announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place Joshua Kimmich spoke Klartext.
The legal defender appeared as a reminder.
"I don't think this is bad luck, we have to work out it again, because we don't make the variety of opportunities and make the mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old stressed just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern team was even behind Dortmund by five meters, which has now taken the lead again by one point.
And so, with a wink, Kimmich valued at least positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It is good for the league.
DFB Boss in the firing line: Özil-Causa: Erdogan ’ s Sharp Attack on Grindel
The Turkish President, Mr Erdogan, has made serious accusations of marginalising Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
The DFB-President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On various stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in Mesut Özil ’.
After the Turkish President violently criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB head defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning Özil personally attacked Grindel at Mainzer's ZDF "Sportstudio" announced consequences from the Causa.
"In the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - we must draw very close conclusions that this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player with no migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had harshly denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our german born and grown Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were allowed to photograph with me in England, "Erdogan said in the Cathedral City on Saturday.
Frankly, as its President, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, have been excluded.
Grindel pointed out to Gündogan that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photographs of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced his intention to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
I have always said that we should have defended Mesut more.
But he does not see any basis for a return to the national team.
As a conclusion, an additional integration representative is to be appointed alongside the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
'If anyone without a migrant background has a clear influence on society and football and says: 'The issue is important, we have to deal with it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration has to work, 'said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup break and the Özil affair, he intends to run for the DFB again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel.
Yearly Building Three Accidents in Three Hours
Coburg / Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
First the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
He told the pensioner that he was driving against her car.
There was no staff exchange, however, as the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later the police received a telephone notification about a driver who would have left the street and driven against a lead post.
On this point, the man did not want a police force on the ground and then drove away.
Then the rodent went home.
However, the pensioner has done his job in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, collecting a building vehicle while turning.
Finally, the police could find and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much more.
The damage is approximately EUR 1300.

Referendum in Macedonia on New State Names
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters should decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
Neighboring Greece insists on this because of its northern province of the same name.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If citizens vote yes, they will also be kicking off their country ’ s Western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion.
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have been 90 years old on September 30.

Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors
The register should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant stresses.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved by Swisstransplant if required.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, as in Germany, Swisstransplant emphasises.
According to Franz immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation, 15 percent of Swiss people are expected to have a donor card.
But only in five per cent of cases will a card be found at the decisive moment by potential donors.
In more than 60% of the talks, the relatives do not know the wishes of the deceased.
"You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome", said Always.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations of storing information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation -" she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be regarded as organ donors unless they disagree with family members.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old pupil World Champion in Headcount
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in headcount.
On the weekend in Wolfsburg he won over 39 supporters.
The Martina Flame-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, announced on Sunday.
16 years old Wenzel Grüß from Germany finished third.
The most recent World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest of a 74 years old pensioner from France, as the main architect Ralf Laue said.
The IT professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were: 14,130 214 x 17,9822 or 57,809.355 + 28 x 16,448.333.
As spectators were not allowed, on Saturday afternoon there was a show where participants beat guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastschrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the contest.
Grüß was already in Bielefeld two years ago, when he was 14 years old.
With terms like superbrains, genius, or prodigy, organiser Laue can do little.
"Headcount can be trained," he said.
Many participants practised several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-oriented computing contests.
Among the disciplines is, for example, square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
The candidates are given surprise tasks when calculating the number of candidates, for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
This is where the Germans would also have a good chance, said the head of town.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage, because they learn headcount more intensively and with other effective methods even in early childhood.
A powerful appeal: video with naked Serena Williams: Breast Cancer screening.
Tennis Ass Serena Williams shows her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to highlight breast cancer and to fight for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinels" - only her hands cover her most intimate spots.
The singer Chrissy Ampelett died of this.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which deals with breast cancer screening that can save lives.
Serena Williams himself would have died almost a year ago.
There were complications when her daughter Alexis Olympia was born.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clumps were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send a draft law on the so-called "Symbole Law" in review.
This is intended to significantly extend the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the West.
Mrs. Holle shakes her beds in the West for the first time next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snowfall down to about 1,000 meters with strong intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern mountains you can expect 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Biel Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road) the road conditions become winter.
On Monday, farmers are allowed to begin their annual Knicks
Schleswig-Holstein farmers are allowed to start the annual Knickpflege on Monday.
The "green ramparts", unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the country with a low forest content for about 200 years.
The tree and stud shrubs, which are up to five metres wide, are "forest substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last refuge areas.
Knicks connect dispersed living spaces as corridors over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks Are Living Fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitation and cattle fence, they also supplied firewood and beams to farmers for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates from that time: through "knitting" the branches could develop the dense, interdependent boundaries.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, around 45 000 kilometres of the hedgerows extend and give the picture of a rich and varied structured landscape.
According to the NABU, some 7000 animal species are now using it as a replacement habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometer of Knick and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
The Knick can only perform its ecologically important function if it is maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he withers into a thin series of trees which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the Knickpflege can only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia talks about on-site SItution.
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radica Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was at that time in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport at Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many are named on surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their homes and there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and petrol stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners are free and it is difficult to find them.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information flow on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it did not work and we only got information from the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people from whom they do not know whether they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but were on work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this? of...........
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear came, many thought 'OK, not a tsunami' - and then it came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there has been misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they have hit the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Fire Ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
But, there are earthquakes every day, but that was the worst here.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed and the earthquake has hit a great many people.
VfB has decided to leave Aogo and Donis for a long time.
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
On Saturday Aogo got a muscle fiber break in the rear left thigh at 2: 1 against Werder Bremen, the Bundesligist announced on Sunday.
In Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle rupture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss matches after the following break.
VfB Stuttgart did not issue a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle loosening usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fibre tear usually conceals a little faster.
Hyper-Realism Triumph at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - Every year the Film Festival of San Sebastián closes the celebrations of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all appearances on the cinema, 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

However, the action went on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - On Sunday morning a white and injured duck fell on the shores of Lake Olchinger.
It remained in the area of water surveillance station.

Biathlete Julian Eberhard scored World Championship Medal.
Biathlet Julian Eberhard was in the stomach for a long time in fourth at Olympia.
Next winter the Saalfeldener will pick up the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old Pyeongchang Olympic print the medal close to touch.
Seven tenths were missing at the end on bronze.
"I deliberately allowed myself time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
One medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the precious metal that has been missing in the new season: "The goal can only be to return to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point you have to strike.

With the season he was ranked second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: Turbospeed FBI investigation
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interviews is very limited.
With an FBI turbo-speed investigation, Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the razor-thin majority for the disputed Judge ’ s Team Brett Kavanaugh on charges of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that took place more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama of Kavanaugh's appeal accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the jurist unleashed a furious tirade against opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the US Supreme Court archconservative judge.
The Republicans ’ majority seemed certain when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his initial announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI inquiry.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who described Thursday's severe reproaches as' appeasement ', initially refrained from further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of' happiness in misfortune '.
In this way, last doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, in an election rally, Trump grabbed the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy. ”
Trump orders FBI investigation in Kavanaugh
The White House has also severely limited investigators ’ powers.
One will investigate the well-known accusations of two women in a targeted manner, but not more, a government representative told the Wall Street Journal: 'They do not go on a fishing trip'.
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar of the municipality of Ried for speed control, which is installed in a "civilian vehicle", will be stationed on the Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1, according to the municipal.
There is also the Bundesschulzentrum ().
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after winning against Mainz: The fear felt.
Trainer Domenico Inglesa and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
Nevertheless, the factor of time played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room, "said the Schalke 04 and Atmete Sports Board.
After all, the royal blue had managed to complete the 1: 0 strike against the Rhine hessen over time and thus the first victory in the season.
Things could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of chief coach Domenico Inglesco, Tedesco had given his assurance: "In sum, the first half was good, both playfully and by pressing," apparently more and more of the head played a role with the increasing duration of the game.
Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Doesn ’ t Do..
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," he said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand it".
The guys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore withdrew.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including, of course, at Tedesco.
"We wanted to make a powerful start in the initial phase and make a fireworks display out of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to go on games for over 90 minutes.
Perhaps the greatest flaw of the afternoon: King ’ s blue missed it, rather than worrying for clearer circumstances.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example, through the strong yevhen konpplyanka, who twice met 59 / 72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have become a victory of quotation," said Inglese: "You have already felt the fear a bit".
I am therefore pleased that we have won.
He was not the only shawker.
Fischbachau: Smoking column in the Leichtal valley visible 2 km.
The smoke could not be overlooked.
From about two kilometres away, a hiker observed a fire in the Leichtal Valley at around 1.30 p.m. on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The reason for this was soon discovered by the police and fire brigade: an unknown person had lit up rubbish on two square metres of the Gwendner mountain.
According to the police, he seemed to have been monitoring the fire for a long time, but left the glut unattended.
This is close to the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy with pulling apart and unloading.
The police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafalani discusses integration: A discussion on equal terms.
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafalani.
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to get interesting people to Greven for many years now", explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffen" - the association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in organizing the evening.
El-Mafalani rises very loosely in the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible figures and one or other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most controversial themes: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts emerging despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, the first-generation migrants at the cat ’ s table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
That leads to conflict.
The decisive factor, therefore, is not whether one is politically on the right or on the left, but rather: 'Am I for or against an open society?', he emphasises.
At first behave rather, then the discussion round starts more and more actively.
And there is a need for speaking.
An Afghan refugee tells from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is on the table, not on stage, a symbol of the debate: it is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not rule out his opinion, stresses that he speaks of average, not individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in this issue, because 'only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions', says El-Mafaalani.
During the signing hour he also listened to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, where prepared Kurdish specialities were discussed intensively.

Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new building area Landsho-Süd on the free market.
The mayor, Roland Frick, informs.,,, and.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality is completed at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous single-country model.
More than 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"At the moment the documents are checked", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.

So Schalkes ’ s Naldo “Great Sport ” also succeeds in the Bank.
Not in the start elf for the third time in a row: nevertheless, Naldo thanks the shawlke trainer Domenico Ingleco.
After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Start11 but on the replacement bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the nearly two meter Brazilian had really spoken the frustration of his soul.
But when the shawkers gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1: 0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and thanked the chief coach Domenico Tedesco to all his professionals, the 36 year-old, who everyone, for the sake of simplicity, called Naldo, turned up and said: 'We have to thank, trainer!'
"That was very emotional, it was great sport," said Tedesco later about the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his renewed reservation, did not have any resentment.
Probolich knows Naldo, who was the best shawl in the last season, that he has not really got on the sidetrack with his coach - but has a break for good reasons.
One reason called "load control".
It was not easy to tell him that.
"It was not easy to tell him this, I tell you quite honestly," Tedesco reported when he said Naldo that he was not in the start eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it is always about the matter, it is about the association ", Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone is able to buy now.
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation that last caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving to be a model team player on the bank.
In August, the mood in Austria ’ s industry continued to accelerate its decline relative to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month low.
Despite this, Austria has the third best atmosphere behind Ireland and the Netherlands, according to the Markit Institute on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is still the 13th month in a row below the 50 meter mark indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
At the bottom were the Greeks (42.1 points).
The mood barometer fell in Germany, France, and Spain, but more slowly than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March, at 44.0 points.
"The slight slowdown may mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter at least.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: exports in the eurozone fell as fast as they did in November 2011.
For this reason, the companies dropped jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
In China, too, industrial production fell more sharply in August than was initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, it highlights developments in sales, employment, camps and prices.

Nice coach Thomas Tuchel runs from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France ’ s football championship.
In the OGC Nice, Superstar Neymar won the title defender with 3: 0 (1: 0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.

The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and made the final position in the post-match period.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) took care of the 2: 0 interim.
Paris also won the general test for the landmark second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
Tuchel ’ s team had to accept the only mandatory game defeat this season at 2: 3 in Liverpool.
