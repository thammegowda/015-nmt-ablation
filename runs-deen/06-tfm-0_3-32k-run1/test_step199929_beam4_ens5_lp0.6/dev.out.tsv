The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases , an offer of Geoportals as Bavaria ’ s state government , are anything but topical - but very revealing .	-7.2606
Especially if you compare them with current online cards .	-2.8787
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the nineteenth century in the Munich area of crime .	-5.0687
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork I do not recognize as such .	-3.6767
In the large overview map were prepared for cities and municipalities more detailed maps , so-called leaflets .	-6.3511
This was the result of the Bavarian survey between 1810 and 1864 and was the first survey of Bayerns .	-6.3092
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.3065
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.7341
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied land and gave a topographic picture of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes .	-4.6827

Compared to early / Today , the capital of the country is the most impressive example .	-5.7473
The city has grown in all directions and has grown together .	-3.1728
An example of this is subsendling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-4.7077
Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , when Munich district was founded .	-5.9657
Today , Untersendling is located in the heart of the city .	-3.3549

Where the Westpark is today , there is nothing to be seen as fields - at first glance : a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : handwriting numbered pieces of the so-called " urine " from which the basic tax was derived .	-8.7337
Small parcels are no longer farmers there , but small gardeners in the " Land in Sun " plant .	-5.8255
A large green area is located north of Untersendling .	-2.7686
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the Oktoberfest site , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert .	-4.9668

In the Official Journal of the Urpositionsblatt , the district of Au-Haidhausen reads not only the street name " am Gasteig " or " Anhöhe " on the lies " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-10.5359
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with madness .	-5.0214
In 1858 / 59 the Munich-Kreis-Irrenanstalt was founded on the Auer Lüften .	-4.8459
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II .	-6.3950

Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-2.9252
The National Association for the Promotion of Colour has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and the racist attacks of the State .	-9.5908
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for African-American travellers , visitors and Missourians to be cautious when travelling through the state , as a number of questionable , race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and here it is stated in the opinion of the group .	-7.4344
A recent law by Missouri , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , which have disproportionately targeted minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , said NAACP .	-6.0945
" You have infringements of civil rights that happen to people .	-3.5101
They are recruited because of their skin colour , they are beaten up or killed , " said the president of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.5270
" We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard . "	-6.2863
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-2.9182
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-6.8486
Sanders died under dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol in the journey and was detained by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of a crime .	-5.7098
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the General Prosecutor 's Office of Missouri , which shows that black drivers are more likely to be recruited in the state than white .	-5.5659
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees what could happen in Missouri " , said Chapel .	-3.1939
" People must be prepared to bring the deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-5.8974
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hassverbrechens-Berichtsprogramm des FBI , which classifies the state as regards the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .	-5.1941
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-3.6772
Prior to that , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the laws of immigration were passed , local law enforcement agencies committed to arresting people for immigrant offences , which , in the opinion of ACLU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-6.9546
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-4.0547
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary .	-1.1549
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-3.0701
The CDU members of the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have given a picture on the ground .	-5.2889
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverbands met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-4.8563
Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his operation , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses five holiday guests .	-5.9646
The " Black Forest milk " is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , so Schwendemann . , , , , . , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.8998
On the table of the holiday guests is exclusively regional .	-6.0994
Since he is also a BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the Weidezaunprojekt as " elementar important " .	-4.6261
I cannot be profitable in such steep areas .	-4.3498
The green area for a lot of work needs to be worked on with the engine sense .	-5.0237
" We are fighting with the conditions and with the topography , " said Schwendemann .	-3.4901
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not carry out a bio plant .	-6.9223
For mayors Thomas Schneider was clear : " The Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunprojekts and is pleased with the Leader-Förderung " .	-5.0642
At the expense of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .	-7.0287
It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be extended even further .	-10.0590
" The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they continue to operate " , stressed the mayor .	-4.9785
Farmers are often criticized for supporting them .	-6.3770
In 2013 , a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced over the Weidezaunförderung .	-4.8473
The open area is 40 hectares , which must not be forged until at least 2023 .	-4.8805
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was promoted through Leader , a district contributed the municipality of Fischerbach .	-5.5612
Thus , farmers love EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of fence .	-4.5026
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-2.4058
Kordula Kovac stressed : " Your job makes a good job , without farmers and rural women it is not " .	-5.2268
Also for Peter Weiß stood firm : " Here are best food produced " .	-4.5551
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables state promotion of female fences .	-4.1903
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.5301
The precondition is the existence of a sponsorship program called by the LPR .	-8.1239
In addition , the area of fences must not be sustainable ( 0.35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-6.1259
For the fisherman 's bacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build just 16 kilometres of fence is under .	-7.1039
The area of disclosure is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .	-4.2493
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.2151
Now Trump ’ s White House is facing the statue of liberty .	-4.8588
The safest sign of a regime change is to start attacking the statues .	-2.6074
The Americans , like any other , therefore , appreciate the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-5.9252
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president to reduce legal immigration with regard to freedom statue .	-4.6435
To remain fair , Miller did not use the statue itself .	-2.6412
A horde of boat owners and liberty-beekeepers would have lied if he had done so .	-4.4621
But he took on their importance , and in particular the importance attributed to it was added as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base .	-5.8695
As a Miller Acosta : " I don 't want to go into a complete story here , but the statue of freedom is a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-5.2377
The poem that you refer to later was added and not part of the original statue is " .	-3.6191
Miller is right , but , as he himself said , it is not really about history .	-4.0466
It is about contemporary resonance to the revealing words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " Your mills , your poor , / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely , / the elusive waste of your rich coasts " .	-7.4910
There was never a time when the " elende waste " was better seen on our screens .	-3.1173
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-3.0699
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about America 's importance .	-4.6142
Lazarus - and their friends who campaigned to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they had taken a highly political action .	-5.7292
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic image .	-4.6600
Lazarus changed this meaning : In her poem , female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-2.9138
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of exiles .	-3.7983
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-6.8155
And just like Lazarus , the meaning of the statue changed , people wanted to switch back from the right wing for a long time .	-4.2946
The great shrine as Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the statue of liberty is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservatives who rebuilt the American flame into the world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-6.5862
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .	-3.2461
The torch should not learn the way in the United States . '	-3.8266
Ziemlich ungewöhnlich ist Limbaugh hier auf etwas gestoßen .	-1.9961
The importance of the statue is , at all , a question of the position of perception .	-4.8814
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , elusive but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships .	-5.2658
It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-4.2404
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and will they have to listen .	-3.5254
And that is not , of course , the prospect that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize .	-5.5880
Their torch should not learn the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power .	-4.0704
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team .	-2.7684
Eilidh Doyle reminds himself of a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team .	-3.4234
The UK ’ s performance director , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team in the World Cup of Conflict .	-10.3487
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-2.5107
Black believes that " in Scotland something special develops " and the UK 's lightweight athletic needs to learn something from it . , , , , . , , , , , ,	-7.3940
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it out , " said Black .	-2.9693
" I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.6825
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.1488
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.5418
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.7523
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-2.0944
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain .	-4.7541
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.4511
Her captain speech was incredibly " , says Black .	-2.4638
" A number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated .	-4.1730
The passion and the real feeling that the Eilidh was of course a great one .	-6.5434
The Commonwealth Silver medal winners , who won their fifth World Championships at the 400-m hurdles , are saying that it is unbelievable that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-12.1603
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , reached in 1983 and 2015 .	-4.3547
The mediocre runner Muir is on this road and has established two European records last year .	-6.8196
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners .	-3.7712
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games after a great season .	-4.7114
Doyle recalls her first World Championships , when the only Scot in the team Lee McConnell was .	-4.0789
The team apitänin says that they are " immensely proud " of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also in the medals and in the finals .	-6.3326
" The special feature of Team-Kapitänin is that she was elected by the other members of the team so that it was so great honor anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me , it makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-6.3161
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.0355
It only shows how far we have come .	-2.0045
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on podiums .	-3.1808
As regards my speech as a captain ?	-2.5688
Yes , I think they went well .	-1.5074
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a World Cup home .	-3.9437
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-5.7215
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be so a great atmosphere out there . "	-7.8114
Blocking critics about Facebook : Do not worry about a public office if you can ’ t stand in the way of electorates .	-7.8461
The father of our country knew something worse off press .	-2.8872
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles .	-4.5719
He sent criticism , certainly .	-3.4642
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.3130
For in 1783 Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stubborn , we will be guided like sheep to slaughter ' .	-5.6822
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-3.1159
Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-3.6396
And the American Civil Liberties Union withdrew it from the beginning of this week .	-3.7778
The bar of the governor left the lawsuit as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.6125
" It is only Facebook " , said many people .	-2.1135
But it is important .	-0.7447
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.4323
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular .	-2.3929
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.4379
Hogan is not a reactionary hit head .	-1.6954
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles .	-3.5978
He was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playing his haarless head to chemotherapy on his side .	-5.0089
Therefore , the blocking of people who come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is officially referred to as being officially paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-7.4846
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-2.9573
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hated people who are swimming online .	-5.2394
The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-2.3951
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , not a troll .	-3.7786
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profan .	-1.9893
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith .	-2.5437
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hasserfilled , but she asked for hate crimes .	-3.6844
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the comment area of the message " The Post " .	-3.3223
" I do not appreciate this idea , even if a number of people speak on the same subject , they are more likely to be disregarded than a so-called collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected . "	-7.3717
What the staff of the governor called " concentrated spam attack " would probably call other " intercession " .	-4.8105
The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-3.4575
It is much cleaner than in previous times if the same had been done that staff were sent to collect newspapers with critical editorials and to arrest or silence demonstrators .	-6.6433
But that is precisely what is happening in digital terms .	-3.2769
Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media .	-2.7955
President Trump is being squandered by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-3.6337
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia .	-2.1111
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US District judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when she appointed a constituent of her facebook page .	-4.6021
And in Kentucky received Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.4911
That should not be so difficult .	-1.7194
At the time Washington had the time of affordable portos having a similar effect as the Internet .	-8.7720
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters suggested his leadership .	-2.8549
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.3922
People who used Pseudonyme like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " , wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-3.8142
Petitions that overwhelmed his position on the treaty of Amity , trade , and shipping with Britain , his office , according to the historical documents collected by George Washington Project Online Papers .	-5.7270
But he did not silence them .	-1.7665
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse form the basis of our nation .	-2.4070
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.9033
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club Club .	-2.5046

Less lung cancer dead by passive smoking	-2.6990
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking .	-2.5269
As a result , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) come to a study .	-3.9967
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking , " said Master Heiko Becher .	-3.5627
As a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994 .	-5.1461
At that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases per year in Germany because of passive smoking .	-4.0312
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-2.0274
Household connections are very complex .	-3.7289
The construction works in the Villinger Straße are in full swing and " are reasonably in the time " , the manager of the Bauhofs Fred Heinze .	-5.0204
In the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much hidden in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .	-6.9670
Transport , which is constantly hampering the construction work , is a major problem for the construction of the Stumpp company .	-6.1614

Elon Musk doesn 't care : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order Order Order Order .	-2.8925
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.7962
In doing so , he has hitherto suggested that part of the customer has withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-6.5654
In addition to the ever-triumphal figures on revenue increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has , for the first time , a different , less glance number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-6.9417
In recent months , Musk often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .	-6.0202
Now , Musk admits that a total of 518.000 pre-orders have been withdrawn again .	-9.0391
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-2.7519
In case of cancellation Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom £ 1000 ) " Reservation Payment " completely back .	-6.9176
Currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations , Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.2693
However , the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders for the problem could not be believed by the Tesla boss .	-10.3135
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-3.9394
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.6575
2018 - all models should be combined - 500,000 , 2020 a million .	-4.0494
Demand for this is obvious .	-2.3468
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-4.1612
Anyone who orders a " Model 3 " today can expect to be delivered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to maximize its nagelnew , never tested production lines without any major disruption with maximum utilization .	-9.1930
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.3971
But if there is too much delay , the impossibility of making reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-5.1855
For then , the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running out of the box .	-6.3410
EPA boss Pruitt withdraws from the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions because of the delay in executing the rules .	-5.6616
A day after having been squandered by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog caused air pollutants .	-5.6732
Pruitt presented the change as his agency responds to the needs of state environmental authorities in relation to responsiveness more quickly than previous administrations .	-13.5138

It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-4.2082

Ever since its arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly gone to block regulation or delay the chemical industry and industry resisting fossil fuels .	-5.5340
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.2270
Last month , a federal court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-4.4059
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his U-turn at Ozonstandards is simply a willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of new standards .	-6.0953
" Under previous administrations , EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " Pruitt said , which EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-7.7951
" We do not believe in regulation by legal proceedings and we take deadlines seriously .	-5.8340
We also take the law and the authority that gives us serious ' .	-2.7934
Nevertheless , the EPA 's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use its ' power to delay and make all the other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are based on a sound policy and the best available information ' .	-5.9332
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules .	-3.4895
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.8821
The measure was not put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.6625
The New Yorker Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of the states that had sue EPA this week , said that the group intends to maintain the legal pressure .	-5.1564
" The reversal of EPA - after our complaints - is an important asset for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog in their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-5.5579

Association wants to check approval of windmills .	-3.9637
" Boisheim does not see any legal precondition for construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat .	-5.1605
The association " Boisheim wehrt sich " has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette .	-4.0767
It is illegal .	-1.9772
The association argues that , at the time of the approval of the Boisheimer Nette on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved , as there is only a quarter of the city ’ s border with Schwalmtal , a wind power center zone exists .	-9.9408
Within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .	-5.7466
Derlei zones are intended to prevent a " failure " of the landscape .	-5.7806
The city of Viersen had approved a few days earlier by changing the area use plan a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but the district government in Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formal error .	-7.4281
" Due to the lack of planning requirements , the approved certificate is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn " , said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim wehrt sich " .	-7.0389
Current state of affairs : The city council decided again before the summer recess to the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; permission of the district government is still pending .	-5.9751
Erkens : " In this respect , the granting of permission for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded " .	-6.5074
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.9188
" The corresponding letters have been entered in the circle of four last week , " explained a speaker .	-5.3123
The circle takes the opportunity to review the matter again .	-4.4400
However , it is not likely that the procedure will be stopped .	-3.7989
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court , the circle did not want to express itself on Thursday in terms of the content of the argument of the association " Boisheim wehrt sich " .	-7.8135
NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build a surface area on the Boisheimer Nette at the construction of four 200 meters high windmills .	-6.3779
Last year , the company involved in the city of Viersen had already entered into contract with the owner of about 65 hectares of land .	-6.3399
With the construction of the four wind turbines , the power needs of around 11 400 households can be met - this is roughly equivalent to a fifth of the power needs of all four households .	-7.4412
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.9068
Last summer , Viersens Stadtrat gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County .	-6.0846

The US President accused him because he had publicly denounced the wall , according to reports he said : ' You cannot tell the press . '	-5.4943
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and gay Mexico to pay for the project .	-4.1681
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-3.6467
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US would take over refugees who emigrated to Australia " ridiculously " , " mies " and " stupid " and that the existence on the trade that was conveyed by the Obama administration would look like a " depp " after proposing a ban on resettlement to refugees in the US .	-7.0716

But if a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost all in the audience will be very real sigh from .	-5.3947
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Moore 's Ford Bridge to emulate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - from Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-4.2134
Nobody has ever been accused of murder .	-2.3817
" It is really incomprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are " , said Tyrone Brooks , who helps in organizing the post .	-4.5299
" It is a jewelry on a story , but it is a burden for our souls " .	-3.0184
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a life long civil rights activist .	-3.9261
It serves as a dramatic call for action , and it is an annual reminder of the monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.8130

According to FBI records received by NBC News , more than 50 men were suspected of monroe and the surrounding counties in the Lynch process .	-3.8266
But no one has ever been charged .	-2.2509
Although suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch 's actions has always been known throughout the city : politics and sex .	-5.1060
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer .	-5.0183
About the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Malcom reported a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .	-5.6029
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had sworn with Malcoms Mrs. Dorothy and that the baby she did not come from her husband .	-4.9467
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , the FBI .	-3.7315
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.1001
But when they moved from prison and moved closer to Moore 's Ford Bridge , Lynchmob moved the car .	-4.9446
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes this from a FBI report .	-4.0153
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , evidences and obscured the identity of witnesses . "	-5.0291
Brooks worded it even more concise .	-2.2371
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-2.8767

For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual rendering of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde .	-3.8307
Their presentation is vivid , seizing , and is based in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .	-6.5464
It is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to watch , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.5579
" We do not want to talk about the Lynchen because we will then be faced with its severity in all of us , " she said .	-4.6220
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I 've done " .	-3.6100
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and loudly , as Greene had a well-rehearsed overview of the play .	-7.0170
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director .	-2.2045
He has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-3.2746
" I feel dirty because I 'm not so " , said Marbaugh .	-2.2247
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-3.0958
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , the Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester play their lines .	-5.8243
The piece begins with Malcom , the hester and afflicts him , angry that he has sworn with his wife Dorothy .	-5.9932
" I said , n --- he , disappearing of my property ! "	-2.6151
Rascona awakes the fire .	-2.8156
There is a break .	-1.1260
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks into laughter .	-3.4524
Greene laughs .	-1.0874
" What ? " , asked Rascona .	-1.6765
It is alarmed and confused .	-1.0105
Was I too hard ?	-1.6155
" No , " Greene said , still kichernd .	-2.0792
" I simply do not think that white people at the time " --- he said . "	-4.0731
" But " , one of the other black performers celebrated .	-6.8345
" You only have to hit the hard " R. " .	-3.1926
And that is precisely because the energy moves in the room , a feeling of comradeship replaces unease .	-7.8393
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.5602
The scene begins again .	-1.5851
This time , when Rascona says the N-word , he strongly says it .	-3.8491
Nobody laughs .	-1.1531
This repetition ends violent and fast .	-1.9021
There are horrors , shots and then silence .	-2.5815
A woman suffering from a sadness stands above the bodies of the actor and performs Billie Holidays mourning eulogy " Strange Fruit " .	-5.4543
Your voice breaks with every second word .	-2.6274
About a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears out of the eyes .	-4.0395
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.9099
A couple is from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street .	-4.1163
They have experienced almost eight hours of Georgian moisture when Brooks travels to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys .	-4.9492
Until this point , the murders remained a anecdote , but now , when one is on the same land , where the Lynch-Morde feels the air is divided .	-5.4232
When the last notes of the song sound , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name .	-3.6271
Children hock to their heads , register the falsified blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other .	-6.3861
" You are not really dead , " murmelt a small boy as he would remember .	-4.0947
After a few minutes Greene dances the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-2.9980
Actors throw the Lynchseil away and wipe their tears .	-2.5566
Bradshaw umarmt Marbaugh , the man in the suit who played the clan member .	-3.9544
Nick Rascona surrounds two of his fellow players and then breaks into their poor wine together , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .	-6.4552
" It is okay " , whispers one of the women .	-5.6816
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.6941
You did this for one reason . "	-2.6923
Later , the audience joined with the actors for dinner .	-4.5029
On a table , a white pair from Atlanta is raised over the display with a black pair that they have just met .	-7.7729
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that leave the feeling of performance .	-4.0294
" It is hard to listen to these terrible words and deeds ... of people coming , who look like you yourself and do that because they look like you , " she said .	-5.5783
" What this really does with me makes me believe that Lynchen is still going on , " she added , " today only the police station station is called " .	-7.2722
In the same room Tyrone Brooks Hof holds his table , he isst and reminds of civil rights .	-4.0461
He said he started planning the performance next year .	-2.1355
" The rendition is somewhat inspiring because it describes the horrors of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-4.5774
" It is as if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .	-3.5523
Who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . "	-4.1054

There is a discussion on a Community area .	-3.4483
One of the two investors who are still on board has offered to come to the community .	-3.8570
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .	-4.4579
The administration and the majority of the municipal council pretend that such a common space is not just a meeting place for the inhabitants of the seniorenfair housing , but an open community .	-8.7963

Yvonne Staiger is very much in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against local participation .	-5.2252
It provides for a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .	-3.6632

Accessibility is also a criterion .	-2.7301
Later , the USS Enterprise-D was extended by train .	-6.5628
" The observer learns a lot of worth of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars " , explained the association .	-6.0494

Fortunas Hoffmann : " Dreierkette works better " .	-2.2248
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 to the season start against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue points .	-5.3533
With the first season game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , would not have been the two counterparts at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-5.7520
" The two counterparts were too much , and we need to fit in Aue even better , " says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.4967
In the Erzgebirge , the Dreierkette should be further optimized .	-4.2353
And a gateway to free up the Fortunes will no longer be imagined .	-7.4311
" For the future it will be so that none more besides Michael ( Rensing ) puts on the line " .	-4.6407
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also be able to cope better with the experience in preparing the trio than the four-wheel .	-8.6643
" I do not know how we will act in Aue , " says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have just built up in the three-quarters on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build the good " , said Hoffmann .	-6.5062
" Prerequisite , but that we are still better harmonised and we are not doing so many mistakes in building up . "	-7.1218
Of course , Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-2.9384
" Whether you can talk about a failed start , you don 't know .	-5.8641
The performance could well be okay , " I hope .	-3.5895
" If we go on Sunday with four points and focus on the pool , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season takt . "	-6.6614
That was not what his trainer wanted to know .	-4.1812
" The start in the season I only judge after six to eight days of game " , said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of Saxony had to be aborted early due to an accident .	-7.1203
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that the players from Aue might even be a little more fresh , because they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorites in the bones .	-6.7835
" But they do not know so 100 % where they are currently " , says the interior defender Fortuna .	-4.3244
Although the guests from the Rhineland are easier than favorites on Sunday to meet at last ( almost ) ready-made stadium of Aue .	-10.2255
" That we swept them away only because we are entitled to come under the first six is nonsense , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is only one defeat against Aue from nine games is positive .	-6.3899
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you have to beat from the start " , explains Fortunas chief coach .	-5.6485
" Such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant " .	-2.9988
And so Funkel does not want to experience his player on Sunday .	-3.7614
New results of the Swedish Asylum Review Test published	-3.7326
The recent results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of those tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-5.3480
The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) started carrying out the tests last year .	-3.1238
They are to be more precise during the asylum procedure when the Swedish migration authority ( migration tax ) was criticised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minor years .	-7.8369
To date , migration has been reduced to 880 cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-5.3530
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person " may be 18 years or older " .	-3.7171
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years old " .	-2.1515
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-2.6870
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .	-3.0839
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant " , he said the magazine The Local .	-3.2959
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has over his age .	-7.2812
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases suggesting that the person investigated 18 years or older " .	-3.6115
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet observed the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-4.3860
The method of medical age assessment , which is similar to the X-ray inspection of Weisheitszähnen and MRT recordings of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-6.7769
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska-Instituts , whose work covers the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they used to be or later as usual by the puberty .	-6.9437
" I had reason to think about this and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.5849
The biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-3.0670
If we cannot say it , we should not pretend that we could ' , he said the newspaper Metro .	-4.5408
Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is incorrect to judge is low .	-7.2430
The biggest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is roughly 10 % . "	-5.1991
Full Plan	-1.8205
The works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well .	-3.1703
On Wednesday , a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge on the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.5673
" We are very good at the time , it runs super " , says Reinhold Leicht , construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Government Bureau Freiburg .	-4.9755

The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap on the northern side of the morning .	-6.2644
This is a fringe fastening which is also used as an operating route .	-5.1287
On the southern part of the bridge , a 2.20 meter wide bridge is to be used on Friday .	-4.4987
That is what the pedestrian route is supposed to be .	-4.5999
The special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo .	-4.4875
The other two bridges are already covered with patented bridges .	-3.0012
Particular sensitivity has required the laying of wires through the construction work in Lauterbach .	-6.1285
Because there is also a glass fiber cable connected to many companies .	-4.6030
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by hand .	-4.6184
In addition , fish and crabs had to be fished first .	-3.3347
For bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the collecting wine in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .	-5.9186
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher Ortseingang , the road in the area of the bridge is locked to the height of the hotel " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " .	-5.4446
The cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000 .	-3.6922
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-3.3715

This is also happening : the Rondellvorplatz provides a band for entertainment in the city hall , including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD-Chairman Uwe Junge .	-6.7953
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Weidel , and the Deputy Chairman Beatrix of Storch to keep their speeches .	-5.8568
The police presence has changed , but so far officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.6397

Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the rot-green government majority , wants to resign for a speedy re-election of the landing day , but does not .	-6.7379
Because on Friday the resolution of Parliament spoke out .	-4.5520
Previously , the surprising exit of a Green MEP from her country faction to the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) had plunged into a serious crisis .	-5.3683

Thümler said that the rot-green government must now decide whether it could govern in this situation without a majority .	-4.4408
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the day of the land should be resolved as quickly as possible .	-5.8578
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-2.8975
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the country ’ s day will be deprived of the prime minister ’ s confidence and a successor .	-5.9506
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.4028
These possibilities must be examined in legal terms , " said Thümler .	-4.2028
" You will discuss all the issues in peace when they are legally reasonable . "	-5.9559
Thümler called Twestens Schritt " doch etwas kurios " .	-1.4726

" The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate , but also betrayal of Red Green , " the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Friday on Facebook .	-4.8493
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil 's decision ( SPD ) to quickly re-elect the day of the country .	-4.6893
The exit of Twestens costs Rot-Grün in Niedersachsen the majority .	-3.3346

Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.0360
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-2.1202
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.4107
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.4440
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in the interview with the German editorial network ( RND ) speech and .	-4.8234
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.3963
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .	-3.4233
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected egg chargers .	-4.5841
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-2.3506
Even though we now know that health risks are virtually impossible , especially as regards what we know .	-7.1433
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlighter is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs ?	-5.7919
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states .	-2.7887
Despite this , my House has immediately switched on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the acquaintance of Germany .	-7.2768
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.0369
Trade , as well as manufacturers , has to ensure that the products sold are safe and healthy .	-4.8790
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic able .	-5.2917
Unpolluted eggs can be sold and consumed .	-2.8009
This time , it is not the fault of companies .	-3.9193
Are production companies and consumers sitting on the same boat ?	-3.3078
According to current knowledge , production companies are not directly responsible .	-5.0282
Instead , they must expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-4.4962
As always , there is too little control in the crop case .	-3.5750
Is there only a lack of staff or even a coherent competence ?	-6.5139
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .	-4.4659
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 % .	-3.4663
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handover to the prosecutors in cases where offences can be identified are of crucial importance .	-7.1216
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide full information .	-4.4275
Is regular alarm really necessary in food scandals ?	-3.5750
Consumers have the right to obtain safe and traffickable food exclusively . .	-9.4840
If a non-authorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-4.0629
This means that manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-5.0064
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the attitude of animal suppliers is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-5.0368
It is important to work consistently at all levels and with high pressure .	-4.2680
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are resolved swiftly and fully .	-5.4916
How the financial rules of football affect Neymars ’ move to Paris	-4.3819
The rules aimed at preventing unfettered expenditure of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars World Record Transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-4.5488
Somewhat the consequences will be for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA , because the leading organisation that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League Tournament .	-5.9449
Financial fair-play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses .	-4.7441
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( 262 million ) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract , and Neymar will receive a salary of several million dollars a year .	-4.4676
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-2.5393
PSG can make money with security , so Neymar subwrites it into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy rich ruler family of Qatar .	-5.9070
Associations may spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to control break-even point in their soccer business .	-6.6371
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007 .	-2.6037
The former French player believed that clubs , which had relied on enormous debt in their quest for success , had effectively cheated and risked to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support .	-6.1936
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.9872
The change meant that the business model , the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential bought and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter .	-4.7181
During the current three-year FFP publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-3.2650
And , while Platini fell from the presidency in 2015 , UEFA ’ s successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to favor discouraging excessive spending .	-3.9982
" Surely FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP , opposite The Associated Press last week .	-3.2058
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the settlement over the duration of its contract .	-4.3619
Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the redeemable for the next five years can be expelled at the end of the year from EUR 44.4 million .	-5.1955
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the heaviest sanctions .	-2.9734
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-4.9841
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by raising their revenue through companies connected with the owners of a club .	-5.0412
While a catarian company could sponsor the PSG , if the value of sponsoring exceeds the standard market rates , the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income .	-4.6631
This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-7.4581
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments of the organizing committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .	-3.7591
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and that such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out .	-8.1608
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.7283
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer , said on Thursday people familiar with the situation .	-3.6415
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .	-6.8248
The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved more than EUR 10 million in sales of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.7930
The accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .	-2.8114
PSG expects Neymars to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising and jersey sales .	-6.6957
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing .	-2.9491
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymars moving away by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.2178
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of the La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily newspaper AS in relation to Qatar 's final ownership of PSG .	-3.6572
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports team , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association .	-3.2321
" It is the consequence of ownership and has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.2501
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-1.9589

Like many applicants in the new tender , Swiss does not want to betray .	-4.2224

According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to renew the treaty beyond spring 2018 .	-3.5747
For sda the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-3.7027

This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90s greeting era ( as the thinking David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch-Komödie " The State " for MTV turned ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things .	-5.5485
As a cultural artifact , it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook able era of permanent memories .	-3.5543

" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a speaking dose vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.4365
By playing at the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play ghostly children who are grown - they still managed to regain the impossibility of regaining the last part of the joke .	-7.4695

It makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillons underlip bart of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old boy .	-5.3267
It is the moments of random madness that this franchise could fuel like a kind of repeated " Seven Up !

Moreover , the officials provided larger quantities of Marihuana and Kokain , firearms , and several hundred thousand euros .	-6.8228
Two people were arrested in Italy at the same time .	-3.4567
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italians .	-3.1650
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany .	-3.1531
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-6.4242
Overall , more than 300 police officers were deployed .	-3.1290
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder and robbery and blackmail .	-3.6097
Since the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor Konstanz has been investigating the organized drug trade in southern Germany .	-4.6295
Between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo , there was an exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.7775
Therefore , the large deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .	-5.2984
Ins Visier of the investigations , especially Italian nationals , referred to the Italian mafia .	-5.4215
Also an incident on 27 May in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired early in the morning , should go to the band 's account .	-6.5073
Thus , large gaps in the length of the register are compl.	-5.9459
" Data from citizens who should not appear " : according to a report , the Foreign Register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-6.3629
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-5.0245
According to a media report , the Federal Government ’ s Beauftragte for the management of refugees , Frank-Jürgen Lücken , drew attention to large gaps in the register of foreigners .	-6.4557
Deficiencies in the data registered there could result in asylum procedures and deportations ' leading to some serious misjudgments , in a way called in an analysis presented by the " Süddeutsche Zeitung " .	-8.1718
According to the register , ten million people are covered by foreign nationality , including 5.7 million non-EU countries .	-4.4721
The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.3663
Because data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality has not been good so far .	-4.1003
In individual cases , data had been found in 1921 , " by people who are no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register " .	-5.7928
" Error data input can significantly slow back processes , " says the report .	-5.6502
In statistics on people who are travelling abroad , EU citizens who do not have to travel .	-6.3195
However , such false regulations have led to a distorted debate on how to deal with foreigners ' , which is to say , the analysis .	-8.6870
Meanwhile , the federal government appears to have begun to send refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children when they have entered there .	-4.9872
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , which reports the " New Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-4.1847
In the paper , therefore , the BAMF introduces such procedures ' relating to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 .	-6.5131
Since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually impossible , so the newspaper , referring to the difficult situation on the ground .	-5.0806
After the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they first reach it .	-5.4294
If a migrant can continue to travel to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of entry .	-4.7422
The reason for this is that the office has now increased considerably for families with minors in Italy .	-7.2176
Italy has made guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-3.0880
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) , these commitments are sufficient .	-3.2341
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement .	-2.8418
The domestic political spokesman in the Linksfraction in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticized this decision : " Families with children are threatened because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare " .	-6.3037

In total , 220 litres of blood in Oberreichenbach provided blood donation services to other people .	-4.7922
At least 12 citizens , who were awarded on Friday .	-4.4896
In the meantime , Jürgen Greule , who now shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations .	-5.8564
Traditionally , the community praises in the meeting of the municipal council several times the willingness to donate blood .	-4.8776
" It is ingenious how our body is designed and we pay tribute to the donors who make their blood available to foreign people , even to the unselfish " , underlined mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-7.9019
" A single blood donation helps several people " , explained the circle manager of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the preserves are broken into their components .	-4.8838
For example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .	-4.0988
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in spring .	-3.5525
" In this year we reached the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK team manager .	-4.3434
Obviously , the change to the theatre house just a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants .	-4.8075
Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were awarded the multiple donors and for 50 blood donations .	-4.6723
Half so many banished Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter ten times the 500 milliliter of their life safes .	-3.8013
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 % .	-1.1345
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about an increase .	-4.0222
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " than it retained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increased pressure .	-4.9104
Policymakers of the Monetary Committee ( MPC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with less members rising this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for increased .	-5.6028
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and to 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just 3 % in the fall .	-5.2072
But they signaled that , in the coming years , interest-rate hikes would be needed to rein in inflation fueled by Brexit , saying that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-5.2923
The members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic package that was issued a year ago after Brexit .	-3.8251
It will take time for the financing plan to allocate cheaper financial resources to banks next February , although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide GBP 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with GBP 115 billion .	-5.9553
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the central forecast of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on real incomes continues to strain household consumption . "	-5.5547
At interest rates , they repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would require a slightly greater degree of inflation and a ' greater ' than markets expect .	-6.7346
Markets are predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another year in 2020 .	-3.1976
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-3.7086
The Bank ’ s downward adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to May .	-5.0927
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.1541
The pound fell in the face of the dollar and the euro .	-3.0819
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .	-2.0116
The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have reduced expectations of an interest-rate hike , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the second quarter of the previous three months to 0.3 % .	-4.8282
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the bank ’ s end of the year .	-3.9090
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage erosion , as tightening becomes even worse before it becomes better .	-6.0017
They added that monetary policy cannot prevent income collapse in the next few years , but they added that wages will recover significantly at the end of their three-year forecast .	-5.4306
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending .	-4.1400
The decision comes a year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the pound .	-4.3650
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to reach the prices and the economy in full .	-3.5816
Before the Bank ’ s final verdict on interest rates , the call for an interest-rate hike has risen , as inflation has pushed pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding a 0.5 % increase in July .	-6.6026
Inflation has fallen from 2.9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and that it will resume in the coming months .	-4.3561
The Bank said that exceeding the target of 2 % is ' totally ' to be attributed to the weak pound .	-5.4522
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive , as creditors are looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way .	-5.0817
The market looks particularly good for those who expire the existing deals and complete the new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular .	-8.5283
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV threats to 10,000 people . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .	-5.5970
Patients will receive preventative treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the NHS drug .	-5.2640
NHS England announced that a preexpositional prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can now reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now estimated to be the first three-year study for 10,000 people .	-6.8977
He declared himself willing to finance the process after last year ’ s appeal court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-4.4002
The NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens , announced on Thursday , was welcomed as " important new intervention " while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this " decisive moment " .	-5.5160
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-4.7383
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.4814
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the HIV transmission of infection risk .	-5.7506
PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .	-3.8202
Such medications can be taken every day or as long as two hours before sexual intercourse .	-4.4020
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-4.2862
In clinics , appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , transgender , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-4.4947
People who live in England and are registered with a veterinary surgeon can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-5.2630
The programme will be £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .	-3.8996
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as used on a large scale , and implemented .	-5.3032
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.3315
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in tackling one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . "	-4.1171
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-1.9019
PrEP , when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.9909
From September to September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .	-5.2991
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.6887
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV will be left behind .	-4.4561
Now that the PrEP-Testmedizin has been procured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . '	-4.1536
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is due after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government .	-4.2195
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.6325
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-2.2375
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will contribute to bringing an end to the spread of HIV in society .	-4.8354
The great life is life : intermediate level and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home .	-4.8347
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , fell in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment .	-3.2453
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack her bags and sold .	-3.5319
" Davor lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room " , says Joanne .	-2.6105
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-3.1612
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.9219
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . "	-4.4437
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken .	-4.0945
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne Stauraum and add an intermediate floor to make the most of the spacious ceilings .	-5.4597
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light .	-2.2080
That was my request , ' she says .	-2.5607
To this end , she commissioned the architect and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill , who used 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to life for Joanne .	-4.7244
The ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces together so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .	-4.5136
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-2.5476
" The steel mill is quite complicated " , he explains .	-3.2347
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were interconnected without having to fill us .	-6.2842
It was not just a simple platform to build , but a steel platform so that it had the right height for the function above or below . "	-5.3630
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .	-4.7496
A classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous residential area .	-4.8348
Brick gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.4347
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.9754
At both ends , a short corridor is mirrored to let him work longer .	-4.8232
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-3.1044
At the entrance , divided units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-4.7006
Through the perception of a glamorous area , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-4.0778
Comfortable kitchens are nothing new .	-3.8458
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-3.6447
" A bit of engineering art went there " , explains Erfan of stahlverstärkten , furnierten MDF door .	-4.1838
" It is obsessive that if you push the door very easily slip . "	-6.1749
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-6.7086
" At the end of the day you will sell the land or how your property is estimated " , says Erfan .	-6.1319
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate based on the land size . "	-4.3725
Here they managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.3599
" The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-2.9871
" You don 't fall in love with electric sockets in the walls .	-3.3274
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . "	-2.6486
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square metre of something standard in something quite astonishing .	-5.2558
In fact , as Joanne , you could decide not to leave this .	-2.4830
Brothers are struggling for a $ 500 million real estate empire .	-2.8770
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a dispute over one of the largest real estate imperies Victorias , worth more than $ 500 million .	-7.3273
The former director of the Carlton football club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared .	-4.5735
Paul wanted to withdraw from family operations since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-5.3073
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since 1973 a business in Smith Street , Collingwood , bought .	-3.9181
The Westco Jeans family was founded there and grew up into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.8379
It was sold to USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.5211
This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in town , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .	-4.5561
After an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as the " main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the assets of the company and Paul about one-third .	-5.8891
A legal act states that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million and Paul has $ 176 million in value .	-4.8280
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem point for Paul .	-3.3422
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought to be the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first monkey avit .	-6.9888
Last Friday , after several failed mediations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.1148
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , ruled out him .	-5.0540
Colin argues that this is not true , but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent .	-3.2482
In an early monkey avit filed by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-4.3407
" My Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority " , he wrote .	-2.6125
The costs rise in the case of hundreds of pages with Affidavits , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and both sides held by law firms .	-4.8989
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s a store in Brunswick .	-4.6951
They used the security to buy Collingwood-Liegenschaft in Colin the first jeans shop of the family .	-4.5672
Colin says that he started there when he was " in my last years of High School , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.7240
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .	-2.8935
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before court , " she wrote .	-2.2026
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis-group of companies , claiming that the company had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars .	-4.8689
Both Lukas and Mark were , as Paul says , " the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter " .	-5.4038
Colin withheld very much , although he was a former AFL member of the board and after a biography from 2015 , Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star .	-5.3375
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.9880
Only Colin answered by SMS to say ' I really cannot say much ' because the case before the courts is .	-3.6032
" It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-3.3118
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .	-2.8993
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , " he said and added that he still hopes a solution " .	-3.5769
On Friday , this hope seemed to be over .	-2.0374
" Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts " , wrote Colin .	-2.2222
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media abstention .	-3.1798
Others have tried and failed .	-1.0104
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .	-2.1684
If so , he will be the first .	-1.3350
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the boss on a more equal course .	-5.0290
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.3699
" When John F. Kelly , the new White House chief of staff , met with senior staff on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he repaired : bad information that gets into the hands of the president .	-5.2604
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he had received good information . "	-4.1508
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tell Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-2.6905
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.7418
" If candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from places that were to convince " , said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .	-5.5177
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control is , according to six former campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady price of praise . "	-4.3832
Okay .	-0.5817
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been under control is ridiculous .	-2.4052
Perhaps these campaign officials know what we do not know - that Trump ’ s tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions .	-4.5604
We will probably never hear anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-3.1082
If his staff managed to keep him away from him several times , their efforts were rewarded .	-5.4005
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-3.0826
Part of the problem is that people in a White House , which is composed of competing parties , are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world .	-5.5193
Politico - dealing with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to give the President strategic reasons dubious information .	-6.0730
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-2.0614
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clips , especially those with embarrassing leaks , and that he is eager to find out where they come from .	-5.7855
This is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the president malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson , the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh accused " to be the source behind a bunch of his leaks " in the White House .	-5.9398
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and has revoked them .	-6.4398
Trump read the article and began asking employees about Walsh . "	-2.9743
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram that Trump receives " .	-4.0999
How did that work ?	-1.7206
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .	-1.7468
Perhaps he will prove himself to be more effective than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers still seek influence .	-4.8355
These unchanged factors make Kelly 's mission very difficult .	-2.2506
The most sought after criminals receive mail from Europol	-4.3657

Travellers negotiate a grave and return to the ' millionaire series ' .	-3.6646
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travelers on war feet who have negotiated a tomb from the community to call back a field before their mansions .	-7.7869
Travellers have their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull , called the " Millionärs-Reihe " .	-4.7143
They have brought horses , babies , and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May , but without being deterred from a tomb taken by the Council to prevent their accidents .	-6.7132
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-4.5430
Wütende residents have afflicted the Council of Solihull , who said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.1483
An anonymous resident said : " You moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath where they cast stones on the passers-by .	-5.3223
The Council must indeed be forced to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem .	-4.2622
Travellers were there in May , moved and are now back .	-4.0195
More came yesterday evening , probably even more . '	-2.7589
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to circumvent it by holding long submissions to protect its parks .	-5.3402
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.4235
A native who did not want to be mentioned , said : ' It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-5.2182

A spokesman in the Council of Solihull said : ' We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls together , and we take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible .	-7.0551
In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .	-4.8139
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . '	-4.1452
From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise	-6.0482
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise will be .	-3.7944
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.7577
This is good news for the city .	-1.7138
After all , the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH to 13 April 2014 lost some 30 000 nights per year and also revenue by the Kurtaxe .	-7.2502
In the autumn of 2014 , with the dramatic rise in the numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered as a gathering accommodation , which caused controversy .	-8.3157
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.7877
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the common .	-6.6296
But especially Freudenstadts Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke about the growing interest in the house .	-5.0347
It should retain the right .	-6.0044
The group Luisenhotels with business leader Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Birkenhof Hotel at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus-category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-6.4331
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object .	-2.3315
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.2620
Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.8222
The former Birkenhof hotel has been in construction for a long time before the entrance , and when you enter the house , you will see how extensive renovation work is carried out .	-9.2737
The floors have been removed , ceilings have been removed from the rooms .	-5.7711
The entire hotel building is a single building .	-3.2835
There is still much to be done by March .	-2.3609
" It is actually a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.5966
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.8957
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned , new windows are installed .	-5.0484
Everything should be " beautiful to the people " , as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-5.7378
" We want to make a piece of jewelry " .	-3.6631
Swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room are among the facilities .	-3.9005
You do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but you have already emphasized an upscale inner city level .	-7.5611
The Waldhotel Luise , with about 60 rooms , is very wide and explains Scherer .	-7.2073
Individual holidaymakers , groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel .	-4.6383
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause have already led him , so Scherer .	-4.2463
The city ’ s ideas are identical to those of the Hotel-Group .	-4.6809
" We are on the same line . "	-1.5191
According to the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to define exactly .	-4.6382
Almost under one million euros , he expects .	-4.8341
The exterior panels are also mounted on the front , which is already clearly visible .	-5.4951
In a courtyard there is a large terrace open to the public .	-4.8885
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.2513
Russland affair : US Special Counsel sets a jury .	-4.0957
In US President Donald Trump ’ s Russia affair , Special Counsel Robert Mueller is supposed to have set up a so-called Grand Jury report .	-5.5294
The panel started work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " in appeal with the cause trusted people .	-6.4599
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations .	-4.1763
The CNN transmitter reported that there are already first invitations of the body related to a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-4.6426
US intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin of deliberately intervening in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-4.1094
Mueller examines whether Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow were there .	-4.4718
In the focus of the investigation , several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as a consultant to the Republicans .	-6.3408
Reports suggest that Mueller also has more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.7844
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Counsel Trump personally put Trump at the center and investigated the allegation that the president may have hindered justice as a result of the affair .	-6.9060
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether or not to charge it .	-5.3427
Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictments .	-3.1791
Most of them are switched on when they are larger and controversial cases .	-4.5365
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .	-1.8391
The body can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to interrogation under oath .	-5.1372
According to the CNN channel , charges have already been issued to turn the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.2524
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to say that they were called upon to do so in the report .	-7.0722
They should also provide documents .	-1.3912
In addition to Trump ’ s Jr. , Trump ’ s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner , as well as his campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were there to talk .	-5.9535
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the appointment of Mueller should not be intimidated in his work and that , if necessary , he should act quickly .	-5.4078
However , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the charge .	-8.0763
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body of the start of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-5.1702
In the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-4.4148
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-2.8561
The issue gives democrats an opportunity to feel " good , because they have nothing else to talk about . "	-7.2451
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion , he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.8954
However , they usually work in secret , emphasized .	-5.8813
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the ' fair ' special intermediaries .	-5.7926
The former FBI boss James Comey said three times that not against the president would be determined .	-3.9698
One has no reason to assume that something has changed , it has been said in the statement .	-6.0019
Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey .	-3.0756
Because of this rush , accusations against Trump had become louder , he wanted to impede justice .	-5.3481
Comey said in June before a Senate committee , Trump asked him to stop investigating the then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-4.6889
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.7224
After the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agents and his staff .	-4.7315
That triggered speculation about whether Trump wants to dismiss Mueller .	-3.3711
Unlike an independent special medium of Congress , such as in the Watergate affair , Richard Nixon resigned to the president , Mueller , who could theoretically be taxed at the insistence of the president of the Ministry of Justice .	-7.3123
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-6.3227
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday , after which the special mediators could no longer be dismissed .	-5.9942
Antarctica : Gigantischer Eisberg drives Antarctica	-2.3134
In the West Antarctica , a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size Berlin has been resolved by the Schelfeis .	-4.9107
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut für Polar- und Meeresforschung am Mittwoch mit .	-2.7147
More than a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of large colossus are now going to need two or three years to melt .	-7.6942
It has 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the last three decades .	-4.6209
There is no danger to people .	-3.6091
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear after research .	-4.4176
In total , however , there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs of icebergs in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-5.4924
According to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .	-3.4330
The now broken Koloss has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-4.9943
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-3.2670
As a result , the sea continues to grow and breaks down regularly .	-5.9941
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America at the tip of the antarctic peninsula .	-3.9562
Nördlich dieses Schelfeises war das Balance von Wachsen und Abbrechen vor einigen Jahren gestört .	-2.3820
A complete slap is there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-3.9209
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger , because the front edges have never gone as far as they are at present .	-7.3701
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and can fall apart if a key spot is dropped .	-7.7501
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea levels , as they swim on the water and sweat ice as much water as the result of melting itself .	-7.8124
However , the loss of the cowardly means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .	-5.2558
This could perhaps increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , the British research project to monitor Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-5.3994
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shark coat of Antarctica according to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-5.4167
From the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge of the free ocean around 200 meters .	-4.7665
It breaks down regularly .	-3.9560
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-8.7698
" This is the most far-reaching retreat since the beginning of the records , " he also confirmed .	-4.2898
Scientists are contentious about whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow up again or , in the long term , go back and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added : " Our models say that it will be less stable " .	-7.8501
But this development will take decades .	-1.9462
Even if these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , many icebergs of the Antarctic Peninsula have declined in recent decades .	-6.1331
This long cid of Antarctica stretches towards South America .	-4.1514
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the Ice Areas of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950 ’ s .	-10.0835
As a result , temperature increases have contributed .	-3.9791
The Antarctic Peninsula has grown by about three degrees in the last 50 years , and is thus one of the areas where the temperature is fastest .	-6.9818
CDU wants domestic tariff for staff .	-6.4504
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant positions , the CDU is calling for the employers ’ association to become more attractive .	-5.3820
Just before the summer break , the Kreistag has gone through 41 new posts in the administration .	-4.6769
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.8884
Now 17 trainees have their first working day .	-4.6745
The apprenticeships appear to be very sought-after .	-4.9939
Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .	-5.6945
However , the circle of staff is still lacking in order to meet the increased requirements and tasks . and . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.9716
At the moment , Mettmann still has 50 vacancies .	-5.5171
Amongst other things , doctors and engineers , as well as the general administration , are invited .	-5.7354
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the district day and to oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .	-6.4135
The administration is to draw up a concept for personnel acquisition and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties .	-7.4481
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers , but also to counteract future-oriented applicants ' scarcity .	-6.4774
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , specific measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive , demand CDU , FDP and UWG .	-6.4555
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.5759
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were previously unknown .	-4.6881
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.4891
There is talk of a genuine ' competition of public employers ' .	-4.6035
This involves a high number of employees who are ill or older due to the service .	-5.2857
So maximum time for action , so that there are no more jobs left .	-6.7967
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-4.0432
He has long since been in the Kreistag for a faustdicke surprise when he publicly questioned the personal-cost cap and hired the other parties .	-8.3758
Peoples want all the possibilities to be reviewed , which will allow the withdrawal from the communal employers ' association .	-7.6650
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the circle administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the local communities - should seek a house tariff ' , so peoples .	-8.1133
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the collective bargaining system for the public service .	-5.6616
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed , increases or more money only if you change to a higher level that is oriented to professional years .	-5.7627
But the tasks of the circle have grown in recent years .	-3.8516
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees care about the provisions of the new prostitutes law .	-4.7999
Last but not least , by increasing numbers of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .	-3.5779
Italy is tightening the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats	-3.7106
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations .	-4.4762
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turiner daily La Stampa .	-3.0600
Minniti ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organisation ' Youth Save ' , because their team effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.5525
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations of the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.9603
" For us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority , so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-5.3740
" We can judge all the accusations that are being made at the moment only after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . "	-5.2380
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Save ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.3326
It is suspected that his crew is carrying snake boats on board , which are delivered directly by traffickers , and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be used again .	-6.6859
At least one such meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Act of Public Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .	-4.5669
The occupation is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-4.6315
Under the Code of Conduct , boats like the Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-3.4708
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to keep to the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-3.0318
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring ' essential changes or disabilities ' to their rescue operations .	-4.4183
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organization Médecins sans Frontières ( MSF ) is . , and . , and , , .	-8.4735
Minniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-5.1289
" In the last few days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the Minister .	-2.8881
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-4.1656
Anstiege and Trials	-2.6010
Neun Weilermer Biker , the " Berliner Außenposten " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy four days of trials and sights .	-4.5528
Three friendly Guides were available for this purpose .	-7.1452
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .	-6.8722
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.7413
The first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim .	-3.4272
It was followed by vantage points , partly on towers from which one could look far beyond the woods and the lagpla.	-7.7875
There has been an ever-increasing increase in numbers for the long trials .	-7.7272
On the second day , after Bad Dürkheim went to Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-3.3872
Once again , viewpoint is linked to viewpoint , through " flowige " trials and moderate increases .	-7.2644
On the last two days , many elevations were met again .	-5.5459
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shopping huts brought welcome breaks .	-3.0955
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers breathe a holistic saline in the outdoor air .	-5.3214

Konsole statt Rasen - Bundesliga rüstet sich für E-Sport Sport .	-2.4530
Are sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of blowing through the wind and weather over the stadium ?	-8.0895
Fact is : E-Sport has long become a serious industry , becoming a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages including .	-5.4621
This is also the first Bundesliga , which is increasingly engaged in this field .	-5.5880
In early 2015 , the VfL Wolfsburg , later the FC Schalke 04 , and last but not least the VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .	-6.7264
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB , " says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.3561
He is sure that " on this train still etliche Vereine aufsteigen " .	-4.3851
Next weekend , FIFA World Cup organizes the first Interactive Club World Cup in London , where the gamclubs of .	-6.5195
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-2.8110
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-2.8022
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.5640
" Real football must deal , in particular , with the 14 to 30 year old , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old . . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.2514
And : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially Asian ones .	-3.3712
With prominent e-athletes under the Treaty , one could be present online much more often on these markets than only once a year to send the federal team to Asia .	-6.9899
What exactly is this about ?	-1.8674
At E-Sport , computer games like " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or the football simulation are challenged at competitive level .	-4.7417
Lonely , as in normal sport , leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .	-6.4999
And in Asienspielen 2022 , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-3.2105
But is it a real sport ?	-3.6106
For many , the idea is certainly needed .	-4.4575
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time .	-3.0820
For the professor at the Deutscher Sporthochschule in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions , which you also find in classical sports - for example increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-6.1110
It also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding , and a rapid response capability .	-4.3656
Professional gamers should not only train to the console , but also train their bodies and respect the diet .	-4.3922
" The fitte player is a good player . "	-1.9862
Froböse also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-3.6133
Inspections are difficult to carry out online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .	-5.5467
The scientists highlight the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-5.1992
Players are on the international stage , as there is a large global family , because there are no intercultural barriers .	-5.2232
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts that E-Sport will have rapid growth .	-5.0283
In 2016 , in Germany , EUR 50 million was implemented , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and large tournaments .	-4.1150
In three years ' time , sales will be 130 million .	-4.4736
There is little against the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the football league .	-6.0054
However , E-Sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey , " write the Deloitte consultant .	-4.9463
Many countries are already more international .	-4.1017
Large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-baseballstar Alex Rodriguez is participating in the US Team NRG eSports .	-3.9860
Hollywood-Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn .	-2.1818
Europe is also doing a lot .	-3.1449
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a subject of instruction , Froböse says .	-3.9077
In the Netherlands and in France , football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department , according to Dutt .	-7.6317
" In European comparison , Germany lags behind " , says VfB Board Röttgermann .	-3.6394
Only in nostalgia to fall , and the old times too cripple , today is no longer enough .	-5.4349
It is a question of preserving the tradition of the association , but also of aligning the company with the modern market .	-4.7877
" We live in a digitized world " , says Dutt .	-2.3344
" It is not possible to hold on to the fact that only football remains as it was always . "	-6.8500

Michelle Carter convicted of the texts urging Conrad Roy for suicide .	-6.3041
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .	-2.6246
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been exposed to the currency .	-4.7322
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .	-3.6265
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : " My family is untreated .	-3.2095
My son was my best friend . "	-1.1210
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .	-3.4607
It was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but its legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered a mental illness .	-3.8252
In red trousers and a creamy flower dressed , Carter was dressed with tears in the eyes , filled with old hands and down-facing eyes when she was convicted .	-7.2362
" Your actions have killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-3.1214
" They ended his life to make their own better .	-2.5200
She has not assumed any responsibility , " she said .	-2.7204
" She has not shown any repertoire " .	-3.8563
But Carter 's lawyer said that it is a ' terrible circumstance , which she completely deplores ' .	-4.3017
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , he did not find out that their " age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions " .	-3.5549
A Public Prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy , who said that there is no day on which I did not regard the loss of my beloved son .	-7.9101
I would like him to be proud of me and how I am dealing with everything , and I try , despite all my pain that we will bear for eternity with us , to be here for his sisters ' , that is to say it .	-7.6995
Roys Schwester , Camdyn Roy , said that she was persecuted by the knowledge that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children .	-4.5782
" Not to have this single person with whom I have been since my birth every day , is a pain I will keep for the rest of my life always with me " she said .	-5.7875
The case seems to set a legal precedent , as there is no law in Massachusetts to call for a crime to commit suicide .	-3.7338
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle .	-1.7806
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text releases revealed that it encouraged him to end his life .	-3.3471
" Häng dich auf , spring von einem Gebäude , ersteche dich selbst , ich weiß nicht , es gibt viele Wege " , sagte sie in mehreren Nachrichten , die sie in den zwei Wochen vor seinem Tod geschickt hatte , während er mit seiner Familie im Urlaub war .	-1.9857
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : " You must do it , Conrad " and " Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . "	-4.1252
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from any press in the case .	-3.8476
The case has divided legal opinion .	-2.5749
Among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Knox , who was sentenced to two years ago for murder in Italy because of her British fellow resident , was released in 2007 .	-8.6168

Something was different from his place in the cabin that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very small .	-4.6781
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups , no Philipp Lahm , and no Manuel Neuer , he made the bind he shared to the arm . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.9731
" The trainer has not announced it " , told the Confed-Cup winner , after his first bet as Bayern-Kapitän .	-4.2084
Well , the booth could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-4.4964
But the sign of Coach was able to interpret Kimmich as well .	-3.6890
Not eight years old Arturo Vidal was chosen in the youth players , debutants and straight out of the holiday professional C-Elf as the leader of the game , but he .	-7.9050
Sugar is best distributed among those who want to mourn a great deal that you want to keep at Laune .	-8.7163
So if you have been asked to challenge Lahm ’ s legacy , you can use a small extra motivation only well .	-7.5358
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want to assume as a player : responsibility " .	-3.5428
On Wednesday the 22-year-old fled as a mini-spawning over the field .	-3.9316
Right behind , this is his position , the white bind on the arm did its rest .	-5.2064
And at all , Kimmich acted in this start-up formation like the one that can best take the ruder in hand .	-8.0464
He gave instructions , tried to distract the invaded force .	-3.6980
He had a look at the whole thing , while many others were busy with themselves .	-4.7558
Vidal , who missed his lack of fitness ( scarcely appte ) ; Renato Sanches so that on devil comme raus the services of the Asia trip ( also due to his ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that in her first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot did not fall negatively .	-11.8542
After all , that was a good thing .	-4.0257
Süle ran next to Kimmich , Rudy before defense , both acted sovereign .	-7.1375
The Napoli storm was often difficult to fill , and additionally , Süle tried to successfully build a few times in the game .	-10.0266
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was not as we hoped .	-3.6883
But he also showed a decent performance in debut .	-2.9790
Moving on , Tempovich : " For this style I was also fetched " .	-5.6930
As unusually , this Bayern-World still lives for the newcomers , one looked after the parties .	-7.1268
Rudy , for example , gave in the catacombs not one or two , but appointed six or seven interviews .	-3.3869
Kimmich passed after a few scarce statements in the back of his new player .	-6.4555
There he heard from Süle an interesting sentence : " What was done here , I have already noticed .	-6.2350
In Bavaria you just have to win every game " .	-4.6208

Companies satisfied with the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissings Tempo	-4.2472
It often reconciled the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.8163
This is more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-3.5067
Kammern und Unternehmen aus der Region sprechen auf T V-Anfrage von einem Wandel in der Wirtschaftspolitik - und tadeln gleichzeitig die alte Ministerin .	-2.6021

A role in the country ’ s plans also plays the West circumvention of Trier , which faces the urgent need for the Federal Traffic Path .	-7.2034
The goal is to start operation in December 2020 , Minister Cornelia Holtmann says .	-4.4784
Natus sees it as a way of supporting regional , but internationally competing companies .	-3.8290
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier is striving to increase the sales in supermarkets and to halt the trend of German wine exports for ten years .	-6.2718

Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash .	-3.6073
A day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.7891
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that ' there are more intelligent options than restrictions on driving ' , and referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-5.8875
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.8051
None of the companies described the undertakings as a call back .	-3.5197
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-3.2882
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines can be considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma .	-2.6388
The cost of car manufacturers to install systems for neutralising diesel vehicles is also too difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-5.5629
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also being accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.5072
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called end-of-life equipment , in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .	-6.8696
In the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.3587

At the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the auditors accused of having installed a system to circumvent emission regulations in Europe , and a question that was focused on the United States .	-5.7923
The inclusion of Audi in the study could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer transfers disproportionately to Volkswagen .	-4.1668

Mordillos Knollennasen and laughter against the suffering	-3.5616
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoons drawing , the node havens of his figures are his trademark .	-5.2724
Also with 85 records of the Argentines and works on a film .	-5.1558
His message : laughter , " because there is too much suffering in the world " .	-2.1379
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.7124
In the first few years as an artist , he proposed , among other things , as a drawing for happiness cards - which frustrated him .	-6.6026
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost " , he said again .	-5.9046
After stops in Lima , New York and Paris he succeeded in the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in the " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-5.6760
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.3715
Again and again the artists of cities inspire themselves .	-4.4002
Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .	-3.6468

For six years he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures .	-4.4924
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos favorite animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent .	-4.0586
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 .	-5.3169
" I do not know exactly what they will say it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.4132
The script is not written by him .	-1.6175
This is why he is more interested in the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without worries .	-7.1302
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change	-2.4651
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.3917
The lavender is due to the drought conditions and to the diseases of communicable insects , and for the time being , what scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions are causing major headaches .	-7.7384
Eric Chaisse , expert in the field of agriculture research CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the last few years , which brought much less rain in spring and in autumn .	-6.1610
This has an impact on the life of lavender .	-2.6781
There is also a small Zikade , a microbakterium , which carries the dwarf kaden , and in very dry weather there are very many of them .	-5.9629
And there is much at stake .	-1.9651
Lavender lures not only for holidaymakers but also for perfumes and cosmetics .	-5.1005
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having a very long plant ear with a large number of flowers , we have underdeveloped smaller , either missing or weakened .	-4.7486
So we have less parts with essential oil . '	-2.2580
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drying .	-8.1122

The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico	-5.6619
The workers of the weekly Riodoce usually meet in Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials , and ceaseless drug wars .	-6.0801
But this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.5621
They have been told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.2083
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what is more secure : they are supposed to take their children into the office , which was the goal of an attack with grenades , or leave them home .	-6.1610
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-3.7641
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and building chairs are sufficient .	-4.3619
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of standing on the government ’ s salary or cartels , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-3.5008
There is no respite from violence , and , throughout the country , the bodies are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012 , 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection , and there have been at least seven deaths this year in seven states .	-6.8902
Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce , co-founder of the Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.3015
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .	-3.4775
His absence is felt deep , although his presence everywhere is present - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his middle finger with the word " Justice " , depends on the façade of the Riodoce building , two reporters in the thirty years , Aaron Iand Miri, wearing T-shi, the face with glasses or his typical panamah.	-6.5064
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their divided themes , the trauma , their nightmares , nightmares , paranoia .	-3.5300
Although a special public prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , only two criminal proceedings have been initiated .	-5.5907
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year , the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .	-3.9507
In Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are inseparable and even though the terrain is now even more traitive .	-6.8023
Without information on the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , Ibarra says .	-3.6048
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.8934
" As long as we do not know why , we trust all . "	-3.4098
On the morning of 15 May , Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan .	-6.8291
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was recruited by two men , forcing him to leave his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with " Twelfters River " .	-7.5621
The shooter drove in his car and damaged it near .	-3.3306
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.7164
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.6214
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan .	-2.2638
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez .	-3.5736
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlegrounds , as rival groups are fighting to fill the vacuum .	-3.2046
There is nothing to make out that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living .	-6.3335
Forget for one minute that there is a state of " peace " if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes in the United States .	-4.1293
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , is a co-founder and director of Riodoce , blaming him for not protecting his friend .	-3.4014
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.4690
First , in February , the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of the rival anti-trust groups in the war with Guzmans Söhnen .	-3.6998
This publication may have annoyed the sons , suspected Gangmitglieder bought each copy of the issue when it was delivered to newspaper kiosk .	-6.9162
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave his own security after the seizure of another newspaper published the same story .	-3.6312
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.1678
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-3.1446
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold USD 50 shares .	-5.4541
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to conduct journalism without encountering the Rauschgift-problem , " said Bojorquez .	-3.2677
The newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising .	-4.1749
Reporter loves to publish tough inquiries without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could treat .	-5.0774
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Award " for her coverage in Latin America .	-3.2864
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever it led them .	-4.6174
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.7949
" I want to continue living " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.8328
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV .	-1.8176
" You have to take over the task that you are a journalist - either you or you play the shower .	-6.3380
I do not want to be asked : " What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? "	-4.6020
The Riodoce team missing Valdez , the Spaßvogel , who , like a dock worker , could flood the friend who was generous with impoverishment and advice , was a teacher who knew how to survive .	-5.0916
They trusted on his routine .	-3.1425
He would always wear his hat .	-2.0512
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-3.3975
Now they ask : Was his love for routine his spoils ?	-4.7945
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive .	-4.3107
" You don 't like it if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their homely start-up and landing tracks " to move drugs .	-7.0859
" These things were not allowed " , said Bojorquez .	-1.3149
The result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.4643
Trust your own instincts .	-2.4131
If it is wrong , stay away from it .	-2.6928
The anger is , said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier . "	-4.1959
The old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .	-8.3868
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.4295
In the space in which Riodoce ’ s staff were trained for security , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed .	-6.7257
Draußen suchten zwei Polizisten Schutz vor der Hitze von 104 Grad ( 40 ° C ) im Schatten eines Baumes .	-2.0047
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan .	-3.4527
Half in the joke , some of the reporters questioned whether these officers are among the 50 % of the policemen that the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-4.9114
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-4.2128
For the edition of this week Riodoce has licked on three main stories .	-4.7673
There was the murder of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.7181
They also had an exposé on government spending focused on the hometown of the governor .	-3.6326
And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block away from the office of the Public Prosecutor , a kidnapping .	-4.2298
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened , so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.6314
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) that dominated almost the entire century all political levels .	-4.1641
More recently , several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption .	-3.7548
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locale , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-5.4011
Only a few months earlier , the readers of Valdez 's column considered the best informed source of abduction .	-5.0202
" Previously we had known what happened " , said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of his slim body stature .	-4.3502
" Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources " .	-2.2999
The Valdez office was dedicated to storing space for signs and stickers that protested against the murders of journalists , because the staff had become something they had never expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-5.6473
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-4.5462
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.7976
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.3129
Throughout the country , journalists have become louder in protest by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on pay and buildings .	-6.6459
On this day , the director Bojorquez away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez .	-4.1095
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they said the truth .	-3.8140
Since then , she has asked for the government to be re-allocated because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-5.2684
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , by the government officials involved and by an equal society .	-7.3004
In his last book " Narco-Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs , but also by command of politicians and security forces who were steadfast with organized crime .	-5.5495
The Media Guard group " Articulo 19 " has ordered more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year .	-4.3402
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouths " , said Ramirez .	-4.5306
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.1974
No one forgets the death of the bloggers Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.5922
Your body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel : " Here I am because of my reports " .	-7.9426
A computer keyboard and headphones in addition to their separate head .	-3.7393
Some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-3.4627
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004 .	-2.6851
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a editorial on the title page with the heading " What do you want from us ? "	-4.5454
Some journalists are fled from their home countries or even from the country .	-2.7321
It is a painful decision .	-0.7955
It is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-3.3290
And sometimes they are hunted , as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-3.7272
For those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-2.8670
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , said that drug trafficking is frightening him .	-4.1969
" Mexico goes to hell , and so I was reporter , " he said .	-2.5839
To finish midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones started to summen .	-9.9491
A series of shooters with bandwidth valves and security forces near the Battleground Mazatlan left 19 confirmed dead .	-5.4983
The war escalated further , as promised by a series of cartels in the region .	-3.0318
From the bordstone edge they have published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phones .	-4.0297
The title page had to be changed on the next day .	-2.2899
This year 's sirens were near - another shooting in the area .	-6.9465
Bojorquez warf a look at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were willing .	-4.3312
If they were afraid at all , they did not .	-5.5985
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa , the staff of Riodoce followed his traces .	-4.9806
" As you can also only remember to close " , said Bojorquez , " if on the same day when Javier was murdered , the internship asked me to send them to the street " .	-5.5893
Dinosaur used Tarnung to escape his enemies .	-5.6214
At first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-4.0226
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorns of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs " .	-4.9535
It was so good that they could even find that their gloves were of Roman brown skin - and they said they would have had something of a " troubled past " .	-6.6708
The report in the journal " Current Biology " described it as " the best-preserved dinosaur he ever found , and one of the best dinosaurs in the world " .	-4.8912
The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier , living in the middle of chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.6737
Its incredibly well preserved state has discovered researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-5.2683
According to reports in National Geographic , the best-preserved fossil of its kind is the plant frescoes .	-5.3959
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was at Suncor Millenium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-2.8337
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rocks and decided to look more closely .	-4.6775
The Fossil discovered by him in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology .	-6.6086
They spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2.500 pound ( 1.100 kg ) heavy earthwise .	-4.4242
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be filled .	-2.9005
" If you only blink a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientists in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to see .	-5.2124
" It will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs " .	-4.5219
Researchers have found that this plant fresser , although it is covered with an armor and a changing tank , is likely to send meat eating dinosaurs threatened .	-6.0815
The dinosaur used a red and white tar to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as countercoating , which is also used by many modern animals .	-7.6786
This would have allowed him to mix better in his environment and to avoid his enemies , experts say what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-5.6455
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-4.0352
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours covering it carefully .	-4.1782
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of drawers and armor over his body .	-4.3175
They discovered the shading of Konterschattierung , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-4.0401
Although the shading is customary , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today .	-4.9092
It suggests that the dinosaur has been hunted by enough pressure by meat , dinosaur , that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-6.9875
But most contemporary animals that use conterization - think of Rehe , Zebras , or Gürteltiere - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .	-5.9356
" Starkes Raubtier-behavior on a massive , heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of chalk time must have been " , said Brown .	-4.7860
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red .	-2.5403
Scientists continue to investigate the animal 's evidence of his life , including his conserved intestine , to find out what it eaten as his last meal .	-4.7223
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was driven into a river and into the sea , where he sank on the back to the seabed .	-4.2096
At this time Alberta was as warm as South florida today , and rivers and oceans probably much further inland than they are today .	-4.2173
" This Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with a conservative skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal " , said Brown .	-7.3335
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same as in the early chalk time .	-3.8140
You don 't need much imagination to use to reconstruct it .	-3.3337
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs , who stood on two legs , traversed the earth .	-8.4441
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur he was driven by some of his fearsome ancestors .	-4.9594
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-2.9666
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Borealopelta has been contaminated and mummified after death in the sea .	-5.1327
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was at Suncor Millenium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-2.8206
According to the museum , it is the best-preserved dinosaur of the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the Schnauze to the hip .	-4.9549
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 metres ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.7333
It contained two 20 tariff peaks , which raged from his shoulders .	-4.8663
Researchers believe that the plagued plant carnivores were swamped by Western Canada until a flood of river flooded into the open sea .	-8.6361
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail .	-3.8269
The remnants of this special specimens are so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered by wood panzers along the dinosaurs . and . , , and .	-11.9065
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in Lotto .	-2.5929
The more I see it , the more confusing it will .	-2.5042
Fixed residues of the skin still cover the holy panels that bear the skull of the animal .	-6.0487
His right forehead is on his side , his five fingers are spun upwards .	-4.5293
I can count the drawers on his sole .	-4.2030
In the thunderstorm : Mass karambolage on A8 : Many injured people .	-4.6521
Heftier accident on Thursday evening at the A8 : Knapp 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-3.8480
There are many injured , kilometres of traffic jams and gaffer .	-3.8460
On the highway Stuttgart-München ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carambolage .	-5.0662
According to the first figures of the police , at 5 p.m. , between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( Aichach-Friedberg county ) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , were transported elsewhere .	-8.7857
The exact number of injuries initially did not provide any information .	-5.0097
It is a light to medium serious injuries , said a police spokesman .	-4.9255
A large offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .	-4.9809
The A8 was completely closed to Munich .	-2.8346
In the direction of Munich , about ten kilometres of backlog was formed .	-6.3307
As an AZ reporter reported , there was also a massive disability in return - due to numerous cases .	-5.8960
The fire brigade took note of the vehicle 's signs , which now have severe penalties .	-6.5157
Shortly after 18 : 45 , an accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.9774
It was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car .	-4.5697
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .	-2.9439
Deutsche Bahn : Group testet " Comfort Check-in " in "	-2.1455
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever seen : nothing is on the train and sleeps .	-6.9305
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant idea .	-4.6602
And then : pufff .	-1.9154
If the Schaffner and wears an unsanft or rides the passenger in the midst of the workflow .	-10.8068
Tickets control .	-4.0825
But the times of interruptions are over soon .	-6.6511
The German Railways are currently testing the creators of free ticket control .	-5.2589
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket .	-5.2357
There is currently a test run on two routes .	-3.8283
" Come the offer , we extend it .	-4.0045
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany , " said a railway precher .	-5.6737
" Comfort Check-in " calls the train the driver card depreciation without Schaffner .	-3.3539
In order to be able to use it , however , some conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-5.4009
And you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers do .	-4.7639
You also have to buy it via the App of the Railway , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticketing .	-4.9542
Last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-3.3277
Because the " comfort check-in " works like this : you get to the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-6.7663
A button for electronic devaluation appears when testing customers .	-5.5397
The attendant will receive a message on their mobile devices that passengers X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-5.3142
If the train attendant knows that there is a passenger with already depreciated online ticket at the Y ticket control station .	-7.8610
We can therefore continue to sleep , continue working , not to mention .	-4.6959
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which is to use the passenger .	-4.9116
" If you want to travel with our train attendant without ticketing , check in the DB Navigator .	-6.5976
This allows passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal " , says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr .	-4.8650
Second Plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-4.0445
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , the ticket controls are among the greatest annoyances . are . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.9644
For it is often the case that you do not have all the documents you need to evaluate online tickets .	-8.5159
Either the credit card is missing or the identity card or any document you have to present .	-6.0987
The result is endless discussions between cabin crew and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the cabin or large room and delays in the control of their own tickets and ends up taking time to address other concerns .	-9.0813
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.7823
And this also applies only to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-3.4660
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated .	-3.8126
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Whose Streets ? "	-2.9991
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-2.8219
Only one day after they arrived in New York City , sat in St. Louis prayer on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on their phone .	-5.1573
She stumbled on a post from someone from the High School .	-3.6063
" The police just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street , " it said there .	-3.8496
Confuse , since no one else posted on their feed the information , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-5.8701
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly on their timeline .	-3.8914
The rapper from St. Louis area was killed by the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed 18-year-old , who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-3.4696
He postete an image of browns live body that was broadcast on the street and would stay there four hours .	-4.7549
" This is wild , " Ferrell thought .	-6.9300
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-2.5617
She put her mobile phone to return to Tweets later on the evening on the Canfield-Drive .	-5.9279
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and of a man who claimed to be browser father who signed a sign : " Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-5.3943
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellenden dog .	-4.5533
In another video , she said she escaped another policeman his rifle and cried : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-4.7972
" This is not customary , " Ferrell remembered her statement .	-3.6064
" This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . "	-3.4082
At this moment I felt joyful .	-3.3797
I was angry and weinte . "	-2.4894
You booked a return flight and went home on the next day .	-3.0998
After landing at 23 o 'clock , she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-5.7195
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from 11 .	-3.4522
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that consists of the view of the people who live in the community and who have filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.9551
When Ferrell , with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown , went to Ferguson , the two promised a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state « .	-13.1284
" You just remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? " they remembered what they said .	-4.0315
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and was not right .	-3.0017
I could not take them away , " said Ferrell later .	-3.0961
" What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past .	-2.4443
They must know and see it and they are raised .	-5.0952
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and black constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves from being free .	-4.6046
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she is personally not blatant racism , she is not different from the next black women 's child .	-6.5191
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep them away . '	-3.9610
The first station , when it was in Ferguson , was on the South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a campground when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson .	-6.3147
Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch .	-4.8168
They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.3577
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell .	-2.5224
" My activism changed after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri St . Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.8310
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.5482
Everything has come . '	-2.4141
weeks later , Ferrell met a demonstration at Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-3.4926
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document only " what happened .	-2.7719
A question came from Ferrell in the sense : " Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? "	-4.5809
This skepticism has been fed by countless cases of people , often whites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .	-4.2823
As Folayan recently said in an interview : " We had heard people born in Ferguson and grew up , their voices were not centred and we wanted to do it differently . "	-4.1323
Folayan had already cooperated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the area known for his activism around death tractor occupants .	-4.3008
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-5.0096
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us .	-3.1965
" This was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because I will be presented . "	-5.4519
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a messias leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-5.2358
As a result , documents from Whose Streets show " surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell ’ s life as they fall in love and marry her wife .	-4.7453
" I felt like naked " , said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-2.0229
" But I have understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the process of humanizing black people . "	-6.3531
Moreover , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement .	-3.1997
Two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-4.0836
" Black , pregnant women in leadership positions have supported the movement as a whole " , said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-6.8046
Black , pregnant women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.9794
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement really is held up by black women and many black women " .	-3.3578
However , it is important that " this is not a affirmative type of action " selected at the Ferrell because of its identity as the heart of the film .	-4.6725
" She was the person who raised this energy , " she said .	-2.8948
" It is no coincidence , even though it was at the forefront because of a life at these crosses as a black gay woman so much at stake .	-4.6640
You can feel your energy through the screen . "	-6.0706
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist .	-3.7720
Ferrell is on the currency for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-4.4403
She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-4.0651
However , she is clinging to a song and she feels obliged to remember it since then , three years ago in Ferguson on the street .	-7.0955
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.9656
It is our duty to win .	-0.9428
We must love each other and support .	-2.9222
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-2.4305
From " dream " to " scale " : TV readers discuss Bit-Galerie Galerie .	-4.4758
The Bit Gallery moves people , although it has not been built for a long time .	-3.2997
But the idea of a shopping center on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been outdated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in proponents and opponents .	-4.3573
Kalt leaves the topic little .	-5.0343
Also on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " the topic is discussed .	-3.4805
While the one to the Bit Gallery say : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be real class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , comes from the other side : " Do not man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Größenwahn ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.4208
While the supporters are counting on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , which also benefits the other shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be blown out .	-7.0059
In addition , the gallery is planned on the plot on which the farm market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-6.6000
At the beginning of the building work will be finished .	-7.7970
The Galerie-Macher want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in Beda Square with possibility to sit outside .	-6.9566
Simone Rooms : " We have been buying a farm hall for many years almost weekly .	-4.9454
Our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women of the land are always very welcome .	-6.7879
Metzgerei has also been discovered for us .	-3.5416
We would like to see this offer maintained during and above all after the construction of the gallery .	-4.1629
In other cities there is also .	-3.4161
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting .	-2.6222
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent .	-4.5756
However , the new project is unlikely to be very low .	-7.7719
Eva Kilic : " Wozu Einkaufspaläste in Bitburg ?	-1.8401
Whether clothing , shoes , drugstores or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-4.1262
There are already enough in our city .	-6.3552
You can see how many Ladengeschäfte have been here for months and years .	-6.0031
As there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least get the market hall .	-5.0683
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly directly offered by the producer and is worth the price above .	-6.7690
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer .	-7.0974
It is a pity that there are almost no more special deals and what is left of them will disappear .	-9.7426
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit me together .	-2.2927
And the gallery does not fit in to Bitburg .	-2.8602
Above all : Where should the farmer market hall go during the construction period ?	-6.0386
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the Bit Gallery actually comes .	-4.5129
Or does it create the Gespenst Bit Gallery before selling all the shops from Bitburg ? "	-8.7034
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-2.1444
And a shopping center that is empty also needs no one .	-6.6461
I think it would have been better to promote a real farm market , rather than this gallery .	-3.6584
But for a farmer market hall gib it is no longer a place thanks to the madness of many - as I find - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-7.9570
When the farmers ' market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-5.7826
A matching similarity : Artist creates Portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA .	-2.6296
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which almost unnoticeable - the cod of the ceiling hangs .	-5.4171
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarschnitten , who were sent by Chelsea Manning .	-2.9081
Manning sent the sections from the Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst had to serve a 35-year-old prison sentence after she classified classified classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website .	-7.0574
The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming Resemblance ( a suitable similarity ) .	-4.0427
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united their expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Manning , a woman and pioneering dissident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-5.5480
Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithmic analysis of DNA , created by Manning , and made from the 30 portraits , as someone with this genomic data might look , a sharp , though somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to create identity .	-7.1126
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has been open since its puberty about identification as a woman , was convicted of 20 indictments in 2013 , including six breaches of espionage law , computer fraud and theft .	-5.6180
The prison suppressed her image so much that there was only one photograph - a basket , black and white selfie , in which Manning is obviously sitting on a driver 's seat and wearing an inblonde wig - with which she was associated .	-7.8317
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg was hit by the great success of her 2012-project Stranger Visions .	-7.2458
It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette mutilation and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people might look like .	-5.0764
This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine .	-2.9437
" She conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning , while she was in prison , and she wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition .	-15.5514
And she could not attend this time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-4.3138
The artist and her imprisoned Muse were exchanged for unequal correspondence , which in the course of two years changed several letters .	-5.4702
They even created a comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo " Suppressed Images " , which saw a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would transform it and would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-8.1707
The fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , that Mannings would demand release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-5.2616
There is now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new tweet ways to address the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .	-7.5583
When Dewey-Hagborg asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a given reason " .	-3.6453
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called with her oversized signature ( the " i " in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end to the " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which is sex , race , sexuality and culture . "	-6.7082
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-3.5970
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucleotide after the advanced scientific lexikon of the artist ) , as astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-5.4901
" What people hopefully will take away is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-4.3385
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are " .	-3.1536
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above comic novel .	-4.4893
She shows Manning how she appears in the hands of the disciplines of the United States like King-Kong .	-8.8268
" If you cut your speech , you won it , " it says .	-5.6421
" So never stop the mouth " .	-2.0151
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greet Philadelphia .	-3.4669
" I still get goose look when I talk about it " .	-4.1834
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as was foreseen in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , by their own genomic simulacles , which merge like the hordes of protesters .	-7.2917
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Statur ) , where their genetic haplogrous were written with pencil .	-5.3086
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to borrow like a crowd " , said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-3.9063
" I wanted it to become like a mass movement that shaped itself with Chelsea , like the movement , also behind her liberation . "	-5.2221
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing .	-3.4037
A nationwide human hunt has been underway for a professor at Northwestern University and a university employee at Oxford , who are considered suspects after a man was killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with lethal injuries .	-6.8759
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) Arrest Wars were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as shown by the Act of the District Court of Appeal of Cook County .	-5.1426
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , after several Stichen verstarb .	-2.5840
A warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-4.9208
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.8138
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead on the spot of what happened , and Detective investigated the Stiche as murder , while the police actively searched for the two suspects , said officials .	-5.3112
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.2683
Alan K. Cubbage , vice president for university relations , said in an email statement that Lathem has now been assessed and ruled out by the head of the Northwestern University .	-5.5093

Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.0743
A spokesman of the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that " we are in contact with the police in Britain and are willing to help US investigators in every possible way . "	-4.5049
The statement added that Mr Warrens was shocked and wanted him to stand .	-4.8068
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Agency , Anthony Guglielmi , said he strongly urge suspects to confront the authorities .	-3.7745
" The police have an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them , " said Guglielmi .	-2.8048
Guglielmi said that local , regional , and national authorities are helping to find suspects .	-4.9417
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building age of the Grand-Plaza building that had just received a enigmatic tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.8876
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.5239
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.5074
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were buildings .	-2.3728
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship " , said Guglielmi .	-1.5671
The management team at the Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident " .	-4.6293
" We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future " - Russian Vice President Mutko Mutko	-3.4997
The Russian Vice President Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) criteria for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-8.0047
" In a certain stage of fulfilment of the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has the right to plan and test the right to collaborate with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-4.0729
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect , " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-2.4485
The PM commented the second part of the WADA roadmap to respect the code , which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and recently published on the site of the organization .	-4.2281
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could give cause for concern to Russia .	-3.2528
" Everything was announced , everything will be implemented .	-2.2115
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future " , he added .	-2.7122
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to accept publicly the reported results of the investigation carried out by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.9381
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : ' We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has acknowledged a mistake .	-4.3497
All measures have been implemented .	-1.3130
But there were no public programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-3.3201
Mutkos ’ words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-2.9839
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov had problems with the past in Russian anti-doping organizations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-5.7084
Nobody has to accept this report unconditionally , ' added Smirnov .	-2.9989
RUSADA was ruled out in November 2015 in the wake of the Doping scandal of WADA from conducting doping controls in Russia .	-4.5442
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.9166
After a visit to Moscow ’ s headquarters in July , WADA ’ s Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to be reinstated .	-5.2043

The start-ups that will help your company will not become the next Uber .	-2.9812
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employee ’ s happiness at your e-commerce start-up , but the surveys did not work .	-3.8087
Answers were often vague , little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent .	-2.9258
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-2.4392
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .	-2.4987
It has created people from outside to help .	-2.8662
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is on guard to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.7923
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it enables companies to carry out surveys , to address specific groups and demographics groups , to offer anonymity and advertising hotlines , and , in some cases , whistleblowern to bypass C-Suite executives and turn directly to the board .	-7.9488
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of their health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee commitment .	-3.3610
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-3.6348
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a hit card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can check why .	-5.2197
Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must stay , so that you will not be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished .	-5.5497
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-3.3334
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial website Let 's Talk Payments .	-3.4981
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , helps companies to prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year amid the Uber case in disrepute .	-4.3592
Convercent has nearly 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.2783
Uber recently registered as a client .	-1.9846
As Glint , Convercent company can send tailor-made " Puls- " surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas .	-5.1784
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.5864
And if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-3.1764
" The court of public opinion captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-3.2300
If a company is found which treats its employees badly or acts ethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott , employee turnover and complaints , said Quinlan .	-5.2901
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Convercent has used more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way of achieving their core business .	-5.9322
In the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company ’ s headquarters , a formal complaint was filed and hope he was taken seriously .	-6.5571
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff .	-3.1174
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems that were previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practice .	-6.3303
" I can come closer to this holistic , 360-degree view in experience with employment " , said Vitrano , who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.8645
" And we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . "	-2.9732
Businesses began to take ethics , values , and employee commitment in 2002 , after the Book of Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-8.2851
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .	-4.1312
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.9295
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service , and burden companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-4.2201
It is a business model and an opportunity that is supported by Venture Capital investors , both start-ups .	-4.4153
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February by companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .	-3.2995
Glitcers secured $ 10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .	-3.8341
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-3.2392
There is a growing research complex which shows that today 's employees expect more jobs than they have done so far .	-5.1080
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-3.1925
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-4.0175
" If the people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint . .	-9.6679
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , when employees work and . are , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.4797
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase the commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-5.0560
The data on the employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .	-7.1799
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take measures .	-3.4772
In fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.7192
And if change doesn ’ t come fast enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and cultivate employees .	-5.7544
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International , the company has seen that have left very much on collecting data .	-5.0589
" For if you do not follow staff will ask , " Have you really heard me ?	-5.4453
Do you care about this ?	-2.7800
And whom do you not care about why should I ? "	-4.0186
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to take measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , so Savior .	-5.0016
And , following the gathering of feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company by the speed of decision making and quality of communication to address the problems .	-6.2927
With Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about employees , and it hopes that in the long term this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry that is known for high turnover .	-7.0607
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-2.2753
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.9098
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.4428
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the break .	-3.7071
It goes on at 23 o 'clock , when a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the new practice team on the camp.	-6.7052
Some have removed their tricot parts and show the back full sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.9234
For a good part of the team this afternoon is an afternoon break .	-4.0751
Players who are enrolled during the summer courses will return to their final exam after the three-hour exercise before returning to the next morning at 6 : 30 pm to the water man Football Center .	-9.9660
" This is for the guys the next three days a real tretmill " , said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.8431
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the player and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.4002
For this reason , the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of players .	-6.1743
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the break moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playing times in Western wood practicing exercises .	-6.1391
They are supposed to be holding exercises during August 18 , 20 before the formal preparations for their launch against Texas A & M in September .	-7.5383
Mora said that he support the rule change of the NCAA , even if it adds a further point to the busy routing of the player .	-5.4407
" We place this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging " , said Mora .	-2.9038
" And they simply pushed it through , they placken on , they are great people .	-5.4120
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-4.1746
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , given the clear lines of its fields from a adjacent parking lot and adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the elevated class , which has already been guarded with footballs , which will be a safety net behind a gate cost area , will not be an easy task .	-8.2683
Bruins-Spieler should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .	-7.9183
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.1145
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to draw an exercise .	-4.8818
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is a pretty good business .	-3.1542
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-5.9463
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.5056
I do not worry too much about that .	-3.6611
We have a plan . '	-0.7886
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against counterfeit news .	-3.1541
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false news to fact-reviewed third parties and their results below the original post then , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , and it is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news .	-6.9541
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible wrinkles and send them to fact-checking agents that may show results from the original article .	-6.4805
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distributional points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-7.4943
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being overwhelmed in the run-up to the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to eliminate hasty postings , as they did before the September elections .	-6.4674
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands , and Germany , a test of the new fact-checking will be launched .	-4.1502
" In addition to the knowledge which stories are challenged by fact-reviewed third parties , people want to make more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share " , said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook-News in a blog .	-5.4676
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the " related article " and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news .	-5.0084
Create a comic novel : A castle in the history of England	-2.0064
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-5.1964
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a love for historical documents .	-4.6480
" I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years " , he says weary .	-3.9491
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand " .	-2.7822
" A Castle in England " stretches from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney , each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz , Briony May Smith , William Exley , Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg .	-4.5180
It is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : He wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly found emotional .	-3.3358
" I only reacted to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 's , who worked for the Jakobiner , " he says .	-5.4649
" This is his thumb pressure !	-2.9364
And letters always smell after smoke , because at that time you breed a fire because of the light .	-5.1055
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were itself .	-5.2999
Ach , I love Archive ! "	-2.2019
For someone who has been beaten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued " ) this seems all too nice to be true .	-6.1534
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the montages of Hyänenköpfe on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .	-5.8261
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape patrons , gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-5.7543
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-2.7115
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 , when the last inheritance , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-4.2244
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , wires on the roof " .	-5.9297
Tagebücher , letters from the time of English empires , maps that show who owned what : " You could think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to have fought for the two families . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.9537
Young , let everything go its way ! "	-3.6295
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader basis into English history , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to rise from 1381 .	-5.2244
" There is a record of a riot that appeared in 1380 at the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-4.4677
" The farm uprising began in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start .	-3.7513
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-2.4561
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit pater , the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation .	-5.7313
Or ' The Smuggler ' , in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed from the 18th century , who performed his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his sardines were buried ) .	-6.7247
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favourite family of Scotney : ' The lords seemed to be quite a palate , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-7.1947
Other generations of Darrell men redeemed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I see them as a bunch of well-looking boys , with a talent to advertise them " .	-5.4032
After the end of his work in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-4.6539
He has made a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki , the site of a sanatorial dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been called back by nature .	-6.5262
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-2.3857
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.6787
It was like : " Ach , now I have to be finished again with the damned life " .	-4.4738
Campaign started : Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf .	-3.2690
With the contraception of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .	-5.6119
Until Thursday , mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team want Nelson Artz to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-3.5421
At the end of August , the culmination of the campaign will be a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth .	-4.3563
" Too nice for us .	-1.9377
Or ' ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-4.8695
" We don 't really think this ( of course ) , " they write on their website yesterday .	-5.3472
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.6101
And to make it clear that manches are better than it seems .	-2.1183
Basically , we are firmly convinced that we , as Bad Honnefer , know the beauty and attractiveness of our city very well . " . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.2324
The action is about more than just a logo and a slogan , that is .	-5.0502
" It is important to formulate a pledge which gives the city an unmistakable unique " .	-8.1754
Finally , they are competing with other municipalities .	-3.4197
The city of Bad Honnef will mark its new roof and the campaign costs .	-6.5967
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-2.4842
Each year at the beginning of August , Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) on retirement and promotions in officer corps .	-4.9528
This week too .	-2.0049
At first glance a normal process .	-2.2659
But nothing is routine for Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.6305
The sitting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as was the case earlier , but in the seat of the Prime Minister .	-4.8482
At the meetings , the Heads of Government chaired the five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and External Affairs .	-5.2949
This meant that the civilians in the YAS were in excess .	-5.3553
The government attracts the reins in the military .	-2.9806
Generally , Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the navy have been deposed .	-5.7695
Since the failed coup , Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.3853
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the Movement of Exil-Predigers Fethullah Gülen , who sees Erdogan as a draftsman of the coup attempt .	-4.8293
For 486 people who were directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating since this week .	-5.9176
Even on the day after the coup , Erdogan described the attempted coup as " God gift " because he gave him the opportunity to clean up the armed forces . "	-11.0056
But has Erdogan really managed the army ?	-2.3943
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article with the heading " Unbehagen im Militär-Hauptquartier " .	-6.9546
In general , there are concerns about an increasing ' Islamisation ' of the army , which , among other things , wrote in the repeal of the head ban on solvents .	-7.1702
In any case , the great clean-up of the army and the security forces continues .	-5.4822
In mid-July , Erdogan , by decree , ordered another 7395 officers , including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers .	-5.1086
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military .	-3.8024
The generals used to be the actual lords of the country .	-3.1140
Three-putted them under appeal to their role as guardians of the secular state order .	-5.0295
After his 2002 election victory , Erdogan pushed the power of the military step backwards , not least in calling for the European Union 's reform targets .	-5.3442
Former officers say that Erdogan is pushing for Islamization of the armed forces .	-4.1752
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a notably non-officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt from fear of persecution abroad , warned the Turkish army in a few years ' time " full of extremists and salafists " .	-6.8075
If so , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-3.9441
In any case , there are doubts about the deployment of the Turkish army in the alliance after the purge .	-5.0851
The management structures and operational capabilities are " weakened " , say Nato diplomats .	-2.8869
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card	-2.0189
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Trump said , cited by the media .	-2.6780
It envisages reducing the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family orientated visas .	-4.7785
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-2.0616
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.5647
" This law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and do so by changing the US way citizens are spent from other countries Green Cards . "	-7.0397
The law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.7265
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-4.8735
Ministry wants to sank for racetrack huttle .	-6.6832
Over the past few months , the future of the racecourse huttles has always been a matter of urgency .	-8.1386
Before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist railway is to be built is to be completed .	-8.1481
In order to ensure the future of the racing platform huttles in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , this year works on the route .	-6.6429
" With the decision to continue to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country is committed to this particularly important link for tourism " , declared Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.5997
The cost of repairing the route was about EUR 2.5 million .	-4.1457
Of this sum , the country takes 75 % .	-3.7691
The Treaty , on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the country , will be finalised , declared sins .	-5.8862
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .	-4.3274
" This means that the roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards are " , said Sühl .	-4.3831
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be closed for a period of eleven years .	-3.0345
In order to ensure that the scheduled scheduled scheduled race start on December 2017 .	-8.0478
The racetrack shuttle is a popular rail connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig .	-5.1199
Over the past few months , a pilot has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the route is used by enough people to order it again in the future .	-7.6508
The route is also overdue in parts .	-3.7670
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry .	-2.3202
Just as you thought that 2017 could not be more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .	-5.0889
Yes , indeed .	-1.1604
Sex-robots are now a big thing .	-2.5314
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . , and . , , , , , , , , ,	-6.4649
According to Noel Sharkey , professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University , and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-2.7640
Customers can choose the color of the robot , its shape of the chest and the type of fingernails .	-3.2289
" People make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , " said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report .	-5.9872
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - deliberately human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .	-5.4276
The user can adjust his robot according to his convictions " and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the chest waist to the type or color of his finger nails .	-6.0326
But it will be even more disturbing because many robots have the " personalities " that would make a step-ford-woman progressive look .	-5.7574
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.6404
The RealBotix-Roboter allows users , for example , to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as shutter speed .	-6.0384
And then there is the True Companion developed Roxxxxy Gold Sex-Roboter with pre-programmed personalities like " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of intimidation and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-4.8023
" Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible " , blacks the site of True Companion .	-3.7166
So she likes what you like and she doesn 't like what you like , etc .	-5.5480
Over the course of the day you also have their votes - just like real people !	-5.1527
You can be tired , fixated on conversation , or you can be " in mood " ! ! ! , , , , , , , , ,	-6.3035
There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the subdued female characteristics , the allusion to rape when one goes a step on Frigid ( i.e. here : resisting ) Farrah , disturbing one most .	-7.1919
On his website , True Companion Roxxxxy compared with a Vibrator , but for men .	-2.5469
" If women ( sic ) have a Vibrator , why can men then have no Roxxxy ? " says it on the site .	-3.7555
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toys .	-3.1804
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as optional addition .	-5.0488
Most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FRR keeps their growing popularity , they remain on the verge of consumer culture .	-5.5374
But what can be learned from the fringe zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .	-4.9426
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission .	-3.6482
There is , however , a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots are emerging at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has irradiated women to be sexually assaulted .	-6.3551
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images that have disappeared and the body and the outgoing eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-7.1745
The Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great jump .	-3.0689
The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with porn star-proportions ) .	-4.2742
Their builders want them to feel human , that they imitate the movement of a real body .	-3.4145
But , at the point when it comes to their ' personalities ' , robots are not real women .	-3.8339
You cannot separate yourself from your pet or simply go away .	-3.7703
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation .	-4.7365
In other words , you are forged slaves .	-5.6134
Or to express it in 2017 ’ s redefinition : service powers	-6.6779
Trump ’ s great achievement ?	-1.7643
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense .	-2.3505
It has become a trump card era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate also divided families in small format .	-5.3540
Around Christmas and Erntedankfest in the US newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s selective relatives .	-4.8381
We are all supposed to have our filter bubbles burst .	-6.7875
Less noticed is Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.0248
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited this week in New York .	-8.0032
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .	-2.4057
With Trump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the Republican relatives , who fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .	-5.1713
To be sure , the essence is a good thing , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks .	-6.5943
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the unimaginable effect of his presidency has put us all on the right .	-4.2374
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the gruesome possibility that his powers will one day no longer be shot .	-5.8520
There is , however , an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump normalizes Republicans of the right wing , which suddenly appears to be the epitome of rationality in comparison with its standards .	-10.6020
I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urkomic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , which accounted for 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) - both in comparison to Trump , in fact , are very mild offences .	-6.9560
If Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-6.7838
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of New York 's carousels , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-5.1272
The horses are huge , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarce and the animals are twisted to look at their own shoulders - extremely finster and the climatic music conveys this in a strange way .	-6.4053
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream .	-4.4759
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not entirely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - but a great circular traffic in the north of London .	-6.7505
The Central Park-Carousel , however , is still a strange magical experience , because here two years old , an 11-year old and two women in the 40-year period can go on and all have a great time .	-6.9400
If I could have evaluated the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-4.1913
On the other hand , I was forced in a department house this week to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-4.5396
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to make an assessment with a 15 % tip - to buy something about the charge .	-6.3091
This does not only lead to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to bring in a situation where no one is required .	-4.8190
The poor woman in the department house stood firm grinsend , while I tired the experience made her credit card with five stars .	-4.5417
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison moved to hospital .	-3.4832
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.5515
Last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his hand , which he suffered from the prison authorities following a case in his cell .	-7.0630
Pistorius was sentenced for murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence .	-4.3028
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine ’ s 2013 , several times by putting a door to the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria .	-5.7794
Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night intrusion that hid in the cabin .	-4.0954
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-3.9561
The National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to South Africa at the Supreme Court , and the appeal could be heard this year .	-5.3193
Pistorius runs the risk that his penalty will be increased for 15 years if the prosecutors are successful .	-3.1300
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7404
As a Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg .	-2.6722
As the last blower of schools , the Viertklässler were made redundant from Fützen and Epfenhofen during the holidays and the secondary schools .	-7.2015
Three of the students of the school go to Gymnasium in the future , four to the Realschule .	-5.8880
Schulleiterin Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-2.6203
As a symbol of school dismissal , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken , but then becomes dismissed in freedom .	-6.2045
This led to the muntere Schar a musical called " The Adler in the chicken of " .	-6.0454
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it erupt from his chickens .	-4.2215
Instead of a chicken dress , a small eagle came out .	-3.8729
But the hope of turning his chicken out of him was that the eagle spread to a high mountain his wings and determined .	-6.9517
After that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance .	-7.6775
The stalls danced with the young gockles , the cylinders trugen to bet .	-5.0413
Adler stands for integration , said teacher Angelika Sitte .	-3.5678
The young animal is different from the other young animals ( chicks ) but belongs to it .	-5.9624
He will never be like a chicken .	-1.8048
His provision is to be free .	-2.6402
She wanted every quarter-clan that he feels accepted in his new school .	-5.3268
It followed the words of thanks to the former head of school Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps in class passports , and the parental representatives .	-8.2078
The chicken time is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-6.2409
They leave their students after two years of teaching very unjust because it was a really great time .	-5.9528
Finally , they can rely on the quarter-hunters .	-4.7682
To conclude , all students have a song of summer time and holiday time .	-5.5088
This was a great pleasure for children .	-4.7716
For the new school year , eight first-class students are already registered .	-4.6998
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece .	-2.8458
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .	-3.9620
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal people was arrested in Sithonia by the police , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.4453
On the same day they were released , while currently an investigation is underway .	-3.6707
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported TV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-2.4530
The Greek authorities have stepped up control of the free camps and have found anyone who will remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fines .	-7.1630
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.0359
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-1.9167
Software Update for diesel vehicles : What those affected must now know is what they need to know .	-4.8228
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.9467
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?	-6.7888
The most important questions and answers in the overview .	-1.9144
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-3.4422
They are intended to improve the emissions behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and in part EUR 6 .	-6.1952
Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt .	-3.0486
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives estimates :	-2.8230
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.3979
No , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .	-1.2860
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have the debris software " , says Anja Smetanin .	-4.2626
Deren Nachrüstung has ordered the Federal Forces Office ( KBA ) .	-6.4468
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-1.5430
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but they have not yet mentioned a precise date .	-5.3585
Daimler has communicated to anyone concerned .	-3.8483
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within the framework of this .	-5.4633
How long will the retrofitting process take ?	-5.5394
" Sword to say " means Smetanin .	-2.6423
This depends on the manufacturer ’ s commitment and political pressure .	-4.0039
" Because we have seen voluntary action by car manufacturers on the environment so far not . "	-4.8556
How long should the update take ?	-2.1535
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.0111
Time consuming could be to get an appointment .	-4.1689
What do car drivers do not make a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-3.8704
The ACE rät to wait .	-3.8101
Suddenly , foreign producers would follow , so Smetanin .	-6.7304
Is there a massive fall in prices of Euro 4 cars ?	-3.0813
The ACE fears this .	-2.4761
But in the regions where driving bans are threatened .	-2.9848
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.2060
The ACE rät , with a sale still waiting .	-3.6860
LL Cool J gets Kennedy Center award .	-2.2617
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glamorous events in Washington .	-1.7380
The first prize ceremony under President Trump promises to be political .	-2.5979
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .	-2.3530
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive a prestigious Kennedy Center awards .	-4.3721
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year also saw Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) .	-3.1183
The awards will be given at the beginning of December .	-3.4781
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and , together with his wife Melania , will attend the ceremony .	-4.4357
The prize-winner Lear announced with progressive TV series that he had already announced that he would not participate in the gala .	-8.0144
" The New York Times " said : " This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and this strains me " .	-5.3734
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear .	-2.9939
The Kennedy named Kennedy after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-3.5564
The former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.3968
We make the City Life Value	-2.5796
Roland Wacker , Haslachs Stadtbaumeister , is going to retire next year .	-3.4491
The job is already advertised - suitable applicants are rar .	-3.3224
Since 31 years Wacker has been mayor of the city .	-4.7480
And the work still makes him great fun , as he communicates in the press interview .	-4.6975
He reports of varied but also challenging tasks awaiting his successor .	-3.9011
At the same time , it is surprising that no application has been made to date .	-5.4696
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the earliest possible time .	-4.7386
In this way , the observance of the regular termination periods should be enough time for a review .	-7.6888
Since Haslach acts as a subcontractor for the administrative community as a civil construction authority , the applicant must have appropriate qualifications .	-6.7112
For this function wants to keep the city in any case .	-3.5082
If they could no longer fill them out , citizens would have to travel to Offenburg .	-4.6419
But proximity to the city , and even important to him , Wacker , who reports from a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizens .	-6.7560
In more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated , looking back on the Wacker with pride .	-5.3489
" We make the city life-value " , he is safe about the construction office and its staff .	-5.3699
But also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatzes , for example , have been employed .	-6.6707
The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium rehabilitation is still a topic .	-4.5260
The latter alone will beat about EUR 1.5 million to book if we are ' right ' , estimates Wacker .	-5.8991
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-3.3871
The work here makes fun . "	-2.4114
There is plenty of room for a city builder .	-6.2024
With Haslach ’ s own building yard and gardening , it is possible to react flexibly to many things .	-6.6583
" You can move a lot " , so Wacker , and the design of the green plants is mentioned by citizens and visitors often praising .	-6.4847
As the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what fits " if new buildings are approved , emphasizing the outgoing mayor of the city .	-6.0325
In any case , the mayor bears high responsibility .	-4.3360
He is a builder , " at the end everything runs here about my table " .	-5.1564
With care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( Tiefbau ) for 15 years .	-6.1489
Also that his successor stays long , Wacker wishes : " We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified with the place and want to stay " .	-5.5550
For continuity is important not only for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .	-3.9492
If you want to rent Roland Wacker , you should have access to the city of Haslach as a diploma engineer or Bachelor of Architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and construction law .	-10.9261
The Stadtbauamt underlines high and lowland construction , construction planning , basic occupational matters , administration of urban properties , urban works farm with the building yard and municipal gardens as well as subbuilding rights authority including monument protection .	-10.9270
Cycling on wires : Southern railway route closed .	-6.0263
According to the police , the hitherto unknown perpetrators had the blue bicycle from the railway track track in the area of Leobener Straße ( B116 ) on the lines .	-6.9093
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-4.3366
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for night hours .	-4.8994
Close to the Tatort were seen by witnesses a rosaroter scooter and a bicycle driver was observed .	-6.4238
" This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich " , said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch to APA .	-3.3937
The perpetrators or the perpetrators themselves would have been put at great risk and would also jeopardise rail transport .	-6.8003
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and plant as well as the delays and costs of rail replacement , Pönalen could also be found on the train customers .	-8.3762
All in all , from a ' substantial ' sum , the speaker said .	-5.1377
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon , rail transport on the South Railway route could not be carried out without disabilities .	-6.6634
Almost ten people were excluded from the Friday morning , two of them concerned long-distance traffic .	-6.7960
freight trains did not fall , but they were delayed .	-3.5271
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch , about 200 meters of pipelines had to be exchanged .	-4.1948
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.6835
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help alleviate IBD ( inflammatory intestine disease )	-7.6515
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.5792
But a new study asserts exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat based protein and dairy products could reduce the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases .	-4.5018
The incurable state in which the US accounts for around 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , causes gastric shrinkage and leaves , recurring or bloody diarrhea , loss of weight and extreme fatigue .	-6.7161
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote tolerant intestines .	-5.2599
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immunization cells in the intestine are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body .	-5.0455
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .	-4.0164
If the balance tends too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory disease .	-5.1396
In experiments , it has been established that a kind of tolerance of stimulant cells occurs in mice , which carry a particular bacterium in its input .	-8.5691
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .	-3.7823
Professor Colonna said : " We have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.7602
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells .	-3.1406
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a drug-tophan rich diet tolerant , less inflammatory Darmmilieus promotes if the same system also affects people .	-5.8095
The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immunization that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had been housed separately , had not .	-6.4211
She suspected that the difference with the intestinal robioms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.5902
The dams of the mice were DNA sequences and six bacteria found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them they lacked the mice .	-5.8034
Moravians were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lacked a Darmmikrobiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-7.2106
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers L. reuteri grew in a fluid and then transferred small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from the mice .	-6.2406
The immune cells developed to tolerate cells .	-3.4421
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan metabolism known as Indol 3 milk acid .	-8.6517
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 % , but when the Tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.0673
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-2.8991
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans like mice , but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-5.1606
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells breed inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-5.0476
Potentially high Tryptophanwerte can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri .	-3.6998
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-2.2993
In Manchester United , Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " , Jose Mourinho believes , after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-4.6003
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role , as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marschierten .	-4.5491
However , Matic was excluded from the preparation Asia-Tournee of the Blues and managed only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admits that he had to improve before the Premier League season began .	-5.9915
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.9809
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-6.0297
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium , as Mourinho his start XI for the beginning of the season .	-4.9269
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho had three other new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " , three of his four priority new commitments .	-4.7061
" Three of four to get , thank the association , " he added .	-4.7129
" I will be happier if they get four of them for me , but they have taken great trouble . "	-3.9318
Boeing " malt " Dreamliner in the sky	-1.2732
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliners in the sky .	-3.2637
The pilot flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , which began drawing but moved to Marquette in the U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliners over the US , which are several thousand kilometers .	-5.5058
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.3355
On the radar screens the form of a Dreamliner was to be .	-6.6845
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.9742
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .	-2.4342
Thus the number " 787 " and the signature logo was painted in the sky .	-3.7844
Neuer Tiefschlag für Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem .	-2.3775
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD , social democratic prime ministers looked forward to elections with some concern to Berlin .	-5.9280
Bloss is not a disorder from the party ’ s central , merely a headwind from the federal – so loudly the most important desire of the election fighters .	-8.4112
Since Martin Schulz , the party has changed radically .	-2.7724
Since then , employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus are observing the events in the SPD governed state capitals .	-5.8409
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with headwinds .	-4.3570
It was deep strikes .	-2.8951
And one after another .	-3.1036
The Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the rot-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Greens .	-4.6945
" This shows once more : Rot-Grün can simply not reliably govern " , said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-5.0103
The surprising group outbreak of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-4.4840
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-9.0469
The Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate .	-5.4090
The CDU overcomes a clear falsification of the electorate .	-3.6962
Elke Twesten must return her mandate immediately , " said the Federal Managing Director and Election Director of the Green RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland ( RND ) .	-5.7783
" This must not be true , " he is fighting for a SPD campaign , when the new Hiobsbotschaft reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-8.1005
Stephan Weil , Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the supremacy of the green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority .	-5.1363
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD provinces .	-4.6768
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.5717
The plight began with the unexpected defeat at the March Saarland election .	-3.5712
A blue eye , no more reassured the comrades at the time .	-5.2094
After the country elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-3.0571
It was then - and everything was much worse .	-4.8560
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln , the Dusseldorf Pleite haute the party smooth .	-4.5708
Carefully , the comrades in the weeks after that were coming back .	-9.9931
Then when they had just had the new courage , the G-20 summit of Hamburg came .	-3.8852
And with him came the next deep strike .	-3.1069
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus at that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie , while his city burned .	-4.3557
And because he was so wrong in crisis communication about everything that could be wrong .	-6.1448
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-1.8333
So now also Stephan Weil .	-2.8882
Because of the VW-Abgasaffäre and its role in the supervisory board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been criticising for a long time .	-5.5922
Miese surveyed were added .	-2.5803
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely precisely because in the last few weeks , more and more attempts to accentuate the covenant .	-8.4099
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .	-5.1227
They left him because they promised to stabilize the party .	-3.8937
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.8142
Because of the fact that the Anglo-Saxon Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance is in fact not guilty of internal stri.	-7.4031
And Schulz is not at all .	-2.6575
Sometimes the comrades try to keep their own rows closed .	-4.2859
Your anger is directed at the Greens , and here especially at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten .	-4.7458
" It is unbearable and democratic , as Mrs Twesten puts her own careers over the interests of all others , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD Bundestagsfraktion , the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland ( RND ) .	-5.8209
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the national list of the Lower Saxon Green Members .	-6.2541
The logical consequence would be that it gives its mandate back .	-3.1129
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestagsfraktion , laments a " undemocratic maneuver " .	-3.1155
" The popular will four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Weil the prime minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the lower Saxon SPD as a top candidate in the federal election , the RND .	-6.0990
" Now , the personal career memory of a future CDU member falsifies the election result , " said Oppermann .	-6.9851
He asked to clarify the background .	-2.7464
I want to know if there has been more or more commitments from the CDU .	-4.1475
Grants for Places III	-4.4631
Anyone who wants to renovate his house in the years may soon receive support from the country .	-5.3256
In addition , Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung were informed on Wednesday in Empfingen .	-4.7705
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again presented a retrospective of what has happened so far .	-4.8062
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen .	-3.6750
At that time , in the rehabilitation area I took over from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the total funding .	-5.8577
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-4.1422
For Schindler , the existing remediations are a " success project " - it is important to promote internal development , not only to open up new building areas .	-7.8755
On 4 April , you received the information from the government Bureau Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area .	-5.4603
The amount of support amounted to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 were received by the country , the rest of the municipality .	-4.8104
How will a rehabilitation area be created ?	-3.9071
We will continue to investigate Schindler , where the " really old " houses are .	-4.3565
However , it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in the planned area .	-6.1078
If necessary , the territorial borders could be deferred again .	-4.8585
The STEG contracted at the Mittwochabend Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-2.4786
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder-Programm " Soziale Stadt " , in which the rehabilitation would then be carried out .	-5.3439
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-5.0346
The measures would be object-related , that is , per plot .	-4.4327
Finally , the rehabilitation area would be defined as a statute .	-4.0887
The authorization period for funding has expired since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-4.4051
Until September of this year , however , the inventory will only be carried out once again , in the context of which the participants in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire on filling out . .	-10.7345
In November or December , the decision on saturation is to be made as soon as possible , so that it can begin with the remedies next year .	-7.8537
Pietzschmann then explained that every commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .	-4.5822
It is a question of assessing and deciding on the extent to which urban planning will be restructured .	-7.1899
It will then be registered in the basic book for the property .	-7.1478
Pietzschmann will come back to Empfingen and get a picture of the situation , promised it .	-5.2413
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .	-4.6217
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be able to be filled out by the end of the summer holidays .	-5.2908
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and land arch " , where it is concerned , among other things , the construction state and the renovation intentions .	-7.6134
In the grey questionnaire , the ' budgetary and housing bows ' , information on size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made .	-5.6770
The blue " operating bogs " is only to be filled when operating in the premises .	-6.2609
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .	-4.3661
Moreover , rebuilding measures are not eligible .	-2.8461
Schindler pointed out that the distribution of the funding according to the ' greyhound principle ' works - who comes first , first exhorts .	-5.8392
You cannot reserve any funding for later " .	-5.1332
Finally , photos of the project " Ortskern II " were shown to make the attendant a rehabilitation " tasty " .	-6.1581
British inventors are themselves using a microchip to get to a mobile movement in house and car .	-6.1190
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a mobile movement .	-7.3362
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between Daumen and Zeigefinger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by its company BioTeq .	-4.1339
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultant to the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-4.6011
The technology resembles a cats and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.4107
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks to houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .	-4.2617
The married father of one has now grown both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .	-4.8975
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands of thousands of thousands of euros .	-3.8653
The decision of the White House to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers according to the military data that were left to TIME magazine until US $ 24,000 .	-5.7084
The green white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.8504
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .	-2.9287
In addition to a yacht from Maine , the helicopter was issued in Connecticut , a fire-fighting car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .	-5.4014
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , after the Navy Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-3.9390
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility " , wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superiors , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-4.4245
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn on 17 July at 7 a.m. for the event at 15 p.m. , and so long remained until the grid between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was cleared this evening .	-5.2235
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .	-5.3246
The original crew was on the ground during the helicopter event , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .	-6.5749
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was required .	-5.5354
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers using state property for political purposes .	-2.6187
Data sets show that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the provision .	-3.4191
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-3.4713
" Klingt , as if you were locked , " said the deputy commander .	-4.7192
The " Made in America " event was referred to by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-3.1294
But official events also have political overtones .	-2.3846
At the event , the President gave an impetus to the reform of health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations .	-8.3256
The use of the aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes .	-9.7637
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.5910
But their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-4.2653
Trump conducted a study in February , when his first campaign rally took place in Melbourne , Florida , Taxidienste , and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors .	-6.5100
" The White House is thrilled by the show " Made In America " - the products from all 50 states , produced by American workers with American materials , " said the Deputy Secretary of the press of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-4.6234
HMX 1 crews often carry training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to set the US President in White House with precise centimetres .	-5.2834
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , HMX-1 in the White House led 58 exercises .	-3.8856
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted on the training needs of the crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-3.9861
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on this day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-2.7877
The White House said that the taxpayer did not present the burden for any of the other requirements presented at the event .	-5.2524
A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in issuing helicopters on the South Lawn .	-7.6764
HMX-1 has no budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.9559
According to US Department of Defense ’ s hourly tariffs for the financial year 2017 , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour .	-4.4537
The flight time of the aircraft is recorded as 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-5.1128
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate .	-3.2544
" The cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.9728
" These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . "	-3.3224
According to a 2015 RAND study , the initial rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .	-5.6348
At this time , the former press spokesman of the White House , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-2.7233
" The idea is to present these week things that are made in America " , said Spicer .	-2.7423
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people , depend on it .	-3.0629
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-3.4297
It is , of course , appropriate to highlight this . '	-2.6817
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he viewed his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he set himself up in the driver ’ s seat of a firefighter .	-6.0720
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and cheered with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-3.7422
" I know Sikorsky very well " , said the President , " I have three of them . "	-2.2464
TC BW Neuss in front of kniffing task	-3.7773
Top runners of the Second Tennis League are joining the third search team at SV .	-6.8984
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third search village SV .	-5.4879

How America of OMV can harm	-4.4746
Really happy , Donald Trump did not act as Mittwochabend his signature under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-7.7793
" In his hate to enact the law , " Congress has wrapped a few " unconstitutional rules " , he estimated .	-4.3627
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of US push .	-4.8990
After all , the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines in the EU .	-4.0758
Accordingly , since then , investors of the domestic OMV , which together with other European companies , are co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea ice Nord Stream 2 .	-6.8297
Drohkulisse is violent . .	-6.0258
Nevertheless , it is too early to assess the consequences , the official statement of the oil company .	-4.1091

The city organizes the Kita Lunch again .	-4.1567
With fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .	-7.0814
The clock is turned back in the urban day-care centre .	-5.2761
On September 1 , Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban nursery facilities ( Kitas ) .	-5.7128

The city operates 46 nursery days in the Krefeld area , 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime .	-6.2785
In the last kitajahr there are 2800 children at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .	-5.5398
" Meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week are explained in the Kita to lunch " , explains Pommeranz .	-4.8057
" The offer also applies in the 35-hour fee if children stay until 14 pm " .	-4.9342
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service from 1 September : you will be warming up the dishes delivered , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , and you will be able to put the meal in your own room , wash and clean the kitchen .	-12.6603
" The employees are assigned a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-3.1838
The size - there are two groups as well as seven group groups - decides on the hourly range .	-3.8774
" The kitchens now belong to the Kita-Team " , says Pommeranz satisfied .	-4.4349
" So they are much more involved and it is easier for Kitaleitung to implement pedagogical concepts " .	-4.0823
It is also a question of healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-4.2586
" The children should help to prepare food " .	-3.0673
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.7182
Also for children .	-2.5629
" You have a known force in the kita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people " .	-3.4237
This continuity is important for children .	-1.5156
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .	-6.8857
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also highlighted the charm of the kitchen performance , which is compared to the cost of self-governing and external procurement for the city as the most economical , i.e. from the press office .	-10.1484
And , while 46 part-time workers are being reset .	-4.4736
" But these hours are not so strong in the field of education , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-5.9298

Two young men at the age of 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to deprive a 13-year-old girl .	-3.5023
According to information from the police , the men told the 13-year-olds who met with friends at the Kolpingstraße , at 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to telephone with the mobile phone of the girl .	-7.4231

GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.1895
A trade union would like to reassure Managern of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production in her factory in Glasgow .	-5.4138
GMB Scotland said that the company had sworn over the future of investments at the Tollcross site .	-4.6144
More than 500 employees work in the plant , which , besides other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse .	-4.6812
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .	-2.9312
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be the first to know if their activities were changed .	-4.4452
In a letter to the subsidiary manager of the company , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called for ' concerns to be expressed that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being promoted ' .	-6.1928
GMB seniors organizer Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we do not need clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply .	-4.2118
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force is focusing heavily on the local community and the large area of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation .	-5.6085
Thus , from the point of view of jobs , wages , and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , rising cost of living and chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie .	-5.8716
A spokesman in Pladis said : " The Filialleiter at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-5.6306
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-3.9874
We discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our operations - and this applies to all our business areas and sites - to remain competitive .	-6.4832
In addition , in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-4.8136
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site and if our operations change at the site , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this .	-10.2651
Has the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago about Neymar ?	-6.0310
The site of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-2.5979
Paris Saint-Germain will not be able to follow Neymar ’ s persecution after making an offer of £ 189 million to resolve his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago against the World Record ?	-7.6247
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer , because Ligue 1-Klub is ready to break the world record more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning to the last season for £ 89 million to Manchester United .	-5.0806
After the end , Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world , PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 a week .	-5.2058
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catalan Executive Board is insisting that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-10.7683
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president against this prospect ?	-3.3944
When Manchester City declared interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-4.1958
" I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-3.2545
" We respect all clubs .	-1.1552
But if they try to sign up to one of our players , this will have consequences . "	-3.4728
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish Association at the beginning of this summer expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti .	-4.2810
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar .	-4.2032

On Thursday evening , the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was coming from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese on his VW at 7.55 p.m.	-5.1396
In the area of the hamlet of Stolzenau he came up with a car on his track , so he had to depart to the right .	-6.7622
The tour operator shifted the ladder .	-6.9102
Pkw was born in Saxony .	-4.7461
The driver of the next passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued its journey without taking care of the accident .	-5.4544
According to the accident accident , it may be good that the Mercedes-Benz had not noticed the accident at all .	-5.0135
The police are now asking the witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the polluter witness , to contact the commissioner at Stolzenau in Tel . 05761 / 92060 .	-5.6217
Interview : " Domspatzen-Report entlastet Papst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger "	-1.6293
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of papal brother Georg Ratzinger .	-4.5494
The author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-2.2050
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussions .	-4.0715
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the reform movement " We are church " , explained after publication to the German press agency , he expects the former Regensburger Bischof and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerite Pope Benedict XVI , an apology .	-5.9233
It would serve the image of the Catholic Church very if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their misjudgments at the time .	-5.0279
The Vatican chancellor " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticized the fact that , when reporting on violence in the domain , " double standards " were applied .	-7.1907
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doubt that it is ' shameful and shameful deeds ' that should be punished and prevented in the future ; conspicuously , however , the ' degree of media manipulation ' , the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian bioethics committee .	-6.5904
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal " , writes Scaraffia .	-4.2663
Also Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis meinte im Interview mit dem Bayerische Rundfunk : " Man geht gerne auf die Kirche los und das ist ein gefundenes Fressen " .	-3.2989
In addition , she pointed out that in her youth ' hockey was a very normal pedagogical means ' to deal with french children , as I was one . '	-6.8270
It would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to earlier decades , because the world has changed .	-3.1585
In connection with the reports on abuse cases , Pope George Ratzinger often appeared .	-5.7472
The author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote " My brother of the Pope " with Ratzinger , is completely wrong .	-6.7259
" I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he evaluates the results of the final report .	-3.4643
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment Attorney Ulrich Weber ?	-3.3293
In total , 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were exploited between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 domains of sexual abuse .	-5.6412
In the final report , Georg Ratzinger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg , states : " To sum up , it is clear that in many cases cases cases of physical and mental violence have been applied .	-7.0287
Especially with high emotionality , the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe .	-5.3419
Despite this , unlike many other defendants , many victims are appalled by the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even associate positive memories with him , despite violence .	-8.4963
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger took his opinion .	-4.7430
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence in Schutzbefohlenen near the Regensburger Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-3.9847
On the one hand , many students raise his " humanity " .	-4.0213
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist , who has become more familiar when a dome musically did not deliver top performance .	-8.7810
How do you consider his biograph to be this final report ?	-3.2091
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger comes at all .	-5.0319
He has just been devoted to eight pages , and he is clearly spoken of every suspicion of complicity or co-existence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-7.4601
The violence at the pre-school also took place outside its sphere of action .	-4.6760
It is possible to accuse him of being too late or of not taking the first suggestions seriously enough .	-7.3209
The Domspatzengymnasium , on which he acted , was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-5.2028
Thus , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes him as a " warm hearty " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understandable " , as an extremely good teacher who regularly contaminated young people with cakes , biscuits and bons , and " always killed by grapes of children " .	-12.0129
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which also led to anger once again .	-4.7100
The fact that he did not only deal with stools and threw the key bund on the ground , but also gave Ohrfeigen distributed and all too french guys to the hair or ears , he himself has already admitted years ago , deeply regrets and apologises for this .	-10.8112
In his honor rescue , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time , the 1960 ’ s , and 1970 ’ s , among parents as well as teachers . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.8762
Do you know about such ignition methods ?	-4.1135
Of course , I think everyone of us born before 1968 .	-2.9053
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-3.6903
Compared to what this report is actually about , that is , the appalling sexual abuse and the violence at the pre-school school , these are , of course , bagatells .	-8.5433
As one wonders whether it is not related to his popularity and role as brother of Benedikt XVI. that many media crashed on him .	-7.6867
On the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him still work diligently .	-5.2029
The truth is , however , that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-3.7250
In the media , a lot has been reported on the subject of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen report .	-5.2268
Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report include any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse ?	-4.8161
Michael Hesemann : No .	-1.6087
No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have trusted the master of the domain .	-3.9640
Not even the parents were greeted .	-3.4977
" I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it , " said a rugged deputy for the others , " It was all very embarrassing to me " .	-5.2371
The real problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse has been , and yet most of the victims remain silent .	-4.6830
If they did not even trust parents and siblings , they certainly did not appoint a choir , who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .	-5.8321
How do I assess the role of Domspatzen students in terms of abuse ?	-6.5002
Michael Hesemann : A student put it as follows : " As far as sexual abuse is concerned ... I do not see a case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) would have had early insights and could have stopped the respective perpetrators .	-7.6370
I also think it is absurd to assume that it is more urgent or clearer , or rather opened up , than to their parents , boarding teachers , etc .	-9.3233
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . "	-3.3800
Thus the report comes to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that the student concerned and / or their environment were able to be confirmed within the framework of the investigation ' .	-8.3763
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is , therefore , entitled to be released by everyone .	-5.9231
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented or notified him .	-5.6797
Therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these crimes in foreign affairs , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-5.0165
In the media much was read by " Gewaltexzessen " at the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-3.7948
Georg Ratzinger 's former master of the Domkapellmeister will look at the " Wegschauen " report .	-6.5699
Do he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.5889
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything is missing in the coverage and has become a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.2428
But that is precisely what is in turn an abuse of the report .	-4.3599
After all , it is kept clean : between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Cathedral Treasures , between sexual abuse and the violence of texzessen and , let us say , other allegations .	-8.3431
Moreover , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a chorus leader of the Cathedral Treasury .	-6.5218
The whole terrible caning education , the cases in which Knaben of sadistic teachers were quite harassed and maligned , including horrific , occurred all along at the preschool school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous states have to have ruled .	-10.3026
But with those , Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with , for he got the boy to face only when they were already on the cathedral treasure barrier .	-5.9066
On that , as most witnesses stress , the theme " Preview " was taboo .	-4.7722
They were only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even " paradietic " conditions .	-5.0848
What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-3.5556
Michael Hesemann : While there was discipline , there was no sadistic violence .	-3.3390
And that is also true of Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims share the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , positive memories of him ' .	-7.7251
At most , the charge remains to be reproached .	-5.0529
But , despite all the efforts , the report could only define two timescales in which it was reported by the states on the pillar .	-5.6759
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was not responsible for the events at a school where he was not really responsible ( so the witness ) , wanted to hear nothing , and then only back in 1993 .	-9.2383
Would Georg Ratzinger be consistent with the circumstances ?	-5.5958
Michael Hesemann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which even reproduced the report .	-6.2655
In this report , he points out that the practice of caning continues to be practised .	-8.1298
In view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.5288
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when caning was also banned in Bavaria .	-7.4677
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-4.8969
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permitted limit had been exceeded .	-6.1731
But you cannot say that he would always have looked away .	-5.1058
That is simply not true .	-1.4229
In 1980 , caning was officially abolished at schools in Bavaria .	-3.2783
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards at the time .	-4.0844
How do you see this ?	-1.5368
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " pitfalls of anachronism " , i.e. the danger of judging past moral standards .	-5.2112
The princess is right here .	-4.9547
But that does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was abominable at all times , and not for what was in the pre-school school of warmth and violence against innocent children , which has already gone far beyond what was then common practice .	-8.5853
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked up .	-3.9873
At the same time , however , I must take Georg Ratzinger 's protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.8950
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is , earcowardly , and hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .	-6.0452
When physical punishment was then banned , it was strictly adhered to .	-5.1607
What image of his Regensburger Zeit has Georg Ratzinger given in the talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-4.8030
Kam the subject of caning also serves the language ?	-5.0903
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict XVI .	-5.6337
Nevertheless , I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.8895
But this must also be said : without this perfectionism , without the insistence of unconditional discipline , it would not have been possible for him to form a world class institution , a true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition , which was twice the same in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-12.2638
With Keksen and Bonbons alone , you don ’ t even make big singers and before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming .	-8.8219
What kind of people have you experienced as Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book ?	-5.1436
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again as a wonderful , humorous , fundamental , deep believers and heartfelt people who cannot imagine that he could only do something to fly .	-8.0642
I get regular contact with how many former treasures still today , 23 years after his Emeritization , keep in contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-5.6252
Those who do not grant him until today that he was too strict to them are clearly in the minority .	-6.1294
Most of the domains are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music closer to them .	-4.8770
And that he may always be a good , fathery teacher - a strict father , certainly , but he was also a loving man of respect , who is still standing up to them today , and who actually honour them .	-11.3786
And I would ask you once again to make it quite clear that everything you are accustomed to is educational methods that were on the agenda at the time .	-7.8086
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .	-3.6008
But it is highly unjust , a man , just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat .	-4.2018
That is the evil intention behind it , all too obvious .	-4.6784
Because the report that has just been published relieves it .	-4.2041
Now , the decency area , a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits , and perhaps not yet familiar with the Bavarian and perhaps even Germany , would not be able to let anyone know the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-10.7257
