Oil tankers "Stena Impero" left Iran's port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas this Friday.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian Government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters for the time being, and the shipping company said that it wanted to wait for an official statement from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was found on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Maritime Road of Hormuz, accused of violating security rules, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary imposition of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which is part of the United Kingdom.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the world ’ s most important maritime routes, connecting the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean, and shipping much of the world ’ s oil exports through the Strait, which has intensified tensions in the region in recent months, with merchant shipping dragging into the conflict between the US and Iran, and several incidents involving tankers and drones.

Solved Conundrum: That is why we cannot tickle ourselves.
A kind of brake in the brain prevents people from tickling themselves, as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening, and progress has been made on why children are so fiercely resisting tickling only to demand more.
After all, it has also become clear why the coming of a kitting hand is already a laugh before the touch, lying on a deep layer in the big brain, which is already laughing at the expectation of kitting.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are kidnapped by humans.
Laughter is suppressed during Self Touch
It is also the case that the brain is not able to tickle oneself, but that the researchers in Berlin found during the experiments at the rats that laughter and the activity of the cerebral cortex in question were suppressed during self-contact.
If the self touch and the touch of others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed, this indicates that the rats ’ brain cannot distinguish between self-touch and touch by others.
In addition, the rats have been trained to tickle themselves, and in doing so they sometimes dismissed this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showed escape behaviour or stubbornness, an ambivalence the behavior of children, and the ambival.

Brexit: Johnson of Its Sister
The premier ’ s sister commented on Boris Johnson ’ s speech at Parliament ’ s first session to lift Wednesday evening ’ s coercive break, and the prime minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on October 31 without an agreement should Brussels fail to respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement, but it how to.

Memorial to the Oslo and Utöya attacks is revealed.
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honour of the victims is unveiled on Saturday in Norway.
The project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled in the same place - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
On 22 July 2011, legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first launched a car bomb in the government quarter of Oslo and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the Social Democratic Workers' Party's youth organisation on the island of Utöya.
Iran Frees British Tankers
The UN General Debate failed to resolve the Iran conflict, but now there is one problem less, and the British oil tanker, Stena Impero, held in Iran, could be a puzzle piece in Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", held in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now travelling to Dubai for medical examinations, explained shipping chief Erik Hånell, who left Iranian waters towards noon.
The State Department in London described the setting of the ship as illegal: 'This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law', as stated in a communication on Friday.
On 19 July, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, accused of flouting the Persian Gulf rules of maritime law, released seven of the 23 crew members at the beginning of September.
The British Government suspected that, behind the establishment of the 'Stena Impero', a response to a similar incident in Gibraltar, where, at the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, had been placed in the chain, with the authorities failing to comply with EU sanctions against the country of war Syria, and the British received the reference to the ship from the United States.
In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released, and the suspicion that it was a barter to the "Stena Impero" was vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormus is one of the world ’ s most important maritime routes, connecting the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean, and shipping a large part of the world ’ s oil exports through the Strait, which has intensified tensions in the region in recent months, with merchanshipping the US-Iran conflict, tankers and drones., the.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries, with the Americans accusing Iran ’ s leaders of wanting to build nuclear weapons, which Iran refuses. The US withdrew from the international nuclear agreement in 2018 to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb, while at the same time ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pressuring Iran ’ s leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a tougher and broadened agreement.
Because of the Stena Impero dispute and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
India has a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
In a survey conducted by the UBS, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to restructure, with Asian financial chiefs considering relocating their production from China calling India one of the preferred alternatives, not just the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war, with a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be creating a more significant role in the global manufacturing chain.
But now India itself has become Trump ’ s focus, dubbed “the Kingdom of Tariffs ” by the whistle in the White House, at the beginning of June, America withdrew trade concessions for 2000 products from the emerging world. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, however, friction with India is merely a sideshow, and America looks at the world ’ s largest democracy through security spectacles as well. Delhi and Washington combine concerns about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean, with a Salve of American punitive tariffs on India unlikely, so India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken a second five-year term in office, is likely to outweigh himself.
The problem, however, lies elsewhere: the empirically reinforced thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development is hard in the Socialist Republic of India, and Modi ’ s zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has stifled all entrepreneurial spirit for too long in the multi-ethnic state, with firms now receiving rapid building permits, benefiting from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law creates preconditions for rapidly liquidating false firms with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. India ’ s economic look has changed much for the better in the first five modes of business in the first five years. But that is not true in trade policy, driven by the desire to protect internationally uncompetitive firms from foreign suppliers, the National Conservative government has even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi hangs on the nimbus of the energetic reformer who is radically reforming his country economically, not least because the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. But, at its core, the India First Advocate never depended on protectionist economic policies, preventing Indian firms from being forced to get rid of anachronistic practices and thus become fit for global competition.
Annocation of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
According to a report by former French President Jacques Chirac, the former head of state will be buried in Paris next week.
The goal of the competition is to make Dabo the first secret hero of the World Cup athletics.
In the first race of men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to shake dangerously.
"I just wanted to help him, everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he caught the attention of the assembled journalists completely unexpectedly, and shuffled, he didn't want to talk at all about his heroism, because he wanted to make his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer, and anyway he would only be proud to represent his country invited to the World Cup; under normal circumstances he would not have been allowed to start.
He did so emphatically on the evening - and much more intensively than he would have thought, because this heroism will be remembered, given that Dabo even gave his competitor Busby the finish line and voluntarily took the final place - well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this race, it had no use at the end, because the Busby, who only came to the finish with a lot of help, was disqualified at the end of the World Equestrian.,,.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies in Lisbon, took part in the World Championships in Doha, but according to official data, he was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes, but under 18 minutes I was already there".

Online retailers: Retail dealers should be able to donate more easily.
For online retailers, many returned packets are lost goods, leaving about 20 million returns to the rubbish, but there is an alternative.
The Treasury has shown online traders like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products rather than destroy them.
Although the companies could not be exempted from the VAT on in-kind donations, the ministry explained in response to a question from the Green Bundestag Group, which was reported by the radio media group newspapers on Friday, traders could to set the market value of returns so low that traders would not to any or to to.,,,,,,,,,,
Bamberg University scholars found that German citizens sent back every sixth package of orders placed on the Internet, and that about 4 of the goods, 20, were, and that donating would cost the companies extra money as the financial authorities rate contributions like sales tax.
Green Group Chairman Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to issue a decree clarifying that non-saleable products can be evaluated appropriately and donated free of charge to non-profit organizations.
Banksy-art to auction: There has never been a better time to sell this painting...
The famous work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned off.
For Branczik, Banksy ’ s work “underlines the regression of the world ’ s oldest parliamentary democracy into the animal and tribal posture. ” From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby ’ s in the British capital until it is auctioned on October 3, it is estimated to be between 1.5 and 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwest of the United Kingdom, where Banksy lives, and this year, the artist the painting with the original Brexit date on March 29th the "Question Time" "DevParliament".
The image could change owner for a million euro.
Last Wednesday, at the House of Commons ’ first meeting, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had a hard bargain with the opposition, following Johnson ’ s forcible break by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to hold the two-fold Brexit on October 31, if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate; in Dover in the south-east of England, he paints an image that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a knife, with thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors arriving in the UK every day.
Brexit Debate Is Like a Park Walk
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’ s fierce verbal attacks on Brexiteers in parliament do not, according to his senior adviser, contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, the current controversy is a “walk in the park, ” said Dominic Cummings at a book presentation on Friday.
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexiteers in parliament in the last few days, accusing them, among other things, of "betrayal" of the people, accusing them of endangering MPs because they could become targets of death threats, he dismissed them as "humbug."
Cummings said that the only way to restore calm would be if MEPs finally respected the British decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that the UK has still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the uproar mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. 'We should with respect', in,,,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister, Khan, Calls for Uno-Intervention in Kashmir
In an emotional appeal, Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the Uno General Assembly.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers, Pakistan and India, Khan said at the Uno General Debate in New York on Friday, "If things go badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst," the United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir, "you should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir, both of which dominate part of Kashmir, and another part of China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn autonomy from India the tensions with Pakistan.
Not Even a Bottle of Water
The protesters in Cairo are calling for the fall of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is reacting harshly to the current protests in Egypt, by firing ammunition on the population, by adding more than 2,000 detainees to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in prison.
But one of the triggers of the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation: poverty, lack of perspective, and the sense of being stifled by one ’ s own government have driven millions to the streets, a problem that the regime of el-Sisi, no matter how tough it is against opponents, has even deteriorated.
Today, one in three people in Egypt live below the poverty line; since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, inflation has reached 10%, and anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola, or the military, which is responsible not only for oppression, but also for the largest economic actor: the military is building roads, houses, football stadiums, producing food, and much more, before el-, and with authoritarian, the Egyptian people have much experience, including the supermarket dilemma.
Tüv checks at the terminal: BER-Chef: No more "showstoppers" for the capital city airport.

Hundreds of electrical cables still need to be remedied, and the Tüv intends to examine them by February. 'In order to the conditions for take-up the work must continue to the shortcomings', in a written..
Lütke Daldrup said that, in many cases, there is a lack of evidence, not so much new cables, and that there is still no release for all the noodles on which cable lines are connected, and the head of the airport expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the entrance to the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily, and the project had already caused another crisis three years ago, this time with smoke plunges which, when a fire is fired, are going down like a canvas, so that the smoke does not spread; they are going too far down, so 36 engines need to be replaced, and there will be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
The opening of the airport has been delayed for years by problems with fire protection and other building defects as well as planning errors.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport, which is why the Supervisory Board should hold a special meeting on 18 October, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.

Study on the Causes of Heart Diseases
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
By analysing the inheritance of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project was the largest of its kind in German-speaking countries, announced by the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday.
In the United Kingdom, the number of people affected by cardiovascular disease in the United Kingdom has increased by more than one percent.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the roughly 20,000 relevant human genes are known to cause disease changes in DNA - so-called mutations - according to the clinic, and about 200 would be added each year.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a firm will to use the data for research into other diseases.
According to the clinic, 45,000 people are the largest local health study in the world.
According to UKE, a person ’ s inheritance can now be decrypted within 24 hours, with a pure material cost of €1300; the first gene sequencing worldwide, published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros; the study is expected to begin on 1 October, with all 9000 samples analyzed by the end of 2020, and initial results expected in the year after.
Nigeria ’ s Police Free Hundreds of Mistreated Boys
In Nigeria, police freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school, and, following evidence from residents, security forces searched the school in northern Nigeria ’ s city of Kaduna and discovered some of the victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said.
The boys were arrested on the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and being "improved"; indeed, the protégés had been detained by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions," said Sabo, who about a hundred children in a small room.
According to the data, the Koranic school has been in existence for about ten years, and local residents would have made the authorities aware of repeated irregularities in the establishment, and the parents would have been shocked to learn about the situation in the Koranic school, said Sabo, who did not know about the suffering of their children, and the operator and six staff were arrested according to the police.
In Nigeria ’ s predominantly Muslim north, there are many private Koranic schools, replacing the often flawed state institutions, and the region ’ s people suffer frequent attacks by armed gangs.

World Football Final: More allegations of Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature Not Valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded.
With a gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football Election, other countries are accusing the Fifa, and Egypt was not even judged, with a curious justification.
Much of the Fifa has proven to be a bad thing in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans by its president, Gianni Infantino, the general conduct of various corrupt officials.
But, having already complained to Nicaragua ’ s captain that he had not voted at all, more inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account; indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The Fifa apologizes that "the signatures on the voting forms were in uppercase letters and therefore were not valid".
Sudan ’ s Trainer Wonderful
While the situation in Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was eventually judged: Lionel Messi in number one, Virgil van Dijk in two, and Sadio Mané in three, but according to Fif, the vote with signatures and official stamps from Sudanese Association..
Nicaragua ’ s captain, Juan Barrera, had also made accusations: “Did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards, ” he wrote, stating that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
On Friday, the association reported that it was true, but of course it was not an intention, and that the completed electoral documents had been labelled 'mistakenly' with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, as stated in a communication from the Association, but the second captain, Manuel Rosas, elected, said: 'We are responsible for the administrative error', as stated in the communication, but both Rosas and the team trainHenry Duarte would 'Messi' ', as stated in the official list of FIFA'.
The other cases have been investigated by the Fifa, but emphasizes that the voting process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
Ukraine ’ s affair: Ranghoh Republicans favor official investigation.
"I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are found," he wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far been reluctant to criticize Trump for the whistleblowers affair, with few discomfort. Scott ’ s statements are now the first sign of this in Trump ’ s party, with moderate Virginia governor having repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as relaxing environmental legislation and tightening immigration rules.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also advocated the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course and the responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and to it.
Scott and Baker, as governor of US states, have formally no say in the Trump case, which is being decided in Congress, so their pronouncements are particularly symbolic, but first Republican senators have also criticized the situation, say Mitt Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, saying that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also report that the Republicans are starting to crack internally.
The affair could lead to the impeachment of Trump, and the House Democrats have announced an investigation into it, accusing him of abusing power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment, with the Democrats ’ majority in the House of Representatives seeking an “impeachment. ” But the choice of actual impeachment would come in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority, so the prospects for such a process ’ s success are slim, and no US president has been relieved by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?

"We cannot scan who the people are, who come without passports," said Neugebauer, "Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya, so it is very likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships." It is therefore very important that this be investigated ".
Italy ’ s former interior minister, Matteo Salvini, immediately called for an apology from rackets who are still being investigated in Italy for helping illegal immigration.

US Budget Dispute: Again, just Bridging Financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget, and the Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional funding until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to raise the spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, the United States will once again be without spending plans before the new fiscal year begins on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21; without such, a shdecision would have occurred at midnight on Monday, with a partial closure by the federal administration.
Avoiding Shutdown
For the time being, the federal administration is being financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the 2019 financial year, which is due to end on Monday, because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws that allocate funds to the various departments and authorities, so the federal administration cannot benefit for the time being from the increased spending framework for the new fiscal year from 1.3 trillion to 1.4 trillion.
Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, have finalized ten of the 12 laws, but spending laws reflect Democrats ’ priorities, which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate; and, conversely, the Senate has more or less prepared ten of the 12 spending plans that are barely majoritarian.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion to build the Wall, one of Trump ’ s major priorities, with Democrats disrupting the Wall ’ s plans and financing for other military buildings and projects.
The Ghosts Divide on Wall Construction
At the moment, it is not clear how the parties want to move forward on this issue; more likely than an agreement on all 12 spending laws over the next seven weeks, there is an extension of transitional funding beyond 21 November, and a shutdown is not ruled out.
Against the background of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process are gaining popularity.
France Allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is expected to continue to be open to single women and lesbians: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, thereby significantly increasing demand for anonymous sperm donation.
In the three days of emotional debate, critics on the right warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future, and the French bishop's conference is also opposed to innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as an "opportunity" for society, portraying the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with gay parents, with the idea that the cost of artificial fertilization for all women should be covered by social security.
Sperm fertilization of dead husband
On the other hand, the National Assembly rejected by a narrow majority an amendment aimed at giving widows access to the sperm of their dead man for artificial insemination; in Belgium, Spain, and the United Kingdom, artificial insemination is permitted "post-mortem." In Germany, there have been cases in the past where women complained in vain of the release of the sperm of a deceased; the opponents of the initiative in Paris argued that a child of this kind would be a "particularly difficult fate".
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken out in favour of artificial fertilization with the late partner ’ s sperm, emphasizing that a widow would be subjected to a "double grief" if her husband ’ s death left her wish for children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment find it unfair that a widow may be fertilized with the semen of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is permitted only for heterosexual couples who are unable to bear children; they must be married or live together for at least two years; Buzyn announced as early as the summer that surrogacy would continue.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - however, it is often difficult for single persons or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: calls for flights to the United States are getting louder.
A lot is flown at universities, which is why the country wants to have a climate tax imposed there in future, and the rectors say that they have no money to pay for it, but now they are under pressure internally.
The universities should also restrict themselves to flying: photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte.
The debate on the climate levy on flights from universities and universities, which was postponed before the summer recess, is coming back to life.
Russia Restricts North Korean Fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the detainees are said to have fished illegally in Russian waters; ten days earlier, 161 North Korean fishermen were already arrested, and there was a firebreak between the border guards and the boat crew, injuring three Russians and a North Koreans, who later succumbed to serious injuries to fishermen, but this time there were no injuries, they were told.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, so North Korean fishermen were travelling in Russian territorial waters, where Russia ’ s coastguard, according to its own data, patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 Tin Fish Captured
According to the report, 30,000 octopus were found on the boats and confiscated, and three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia ’ s fishing authorities had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested temporarily this year, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen fishing with narrow-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia, which would also take small creatures out of the sea, and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
In the future, only 18,000 will remain: the US will reduce the asylum ceiling.
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected White House police officers.
The world ’ s richest country is closing itself off from those seeking protection: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the ceiling on legal migration of refugees will be further lowered, with the main aim in the future being to grant asylum to threatened believers and Iraqis.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low threshold for accepting new refugees again, with a target of at most 18,000 people in the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, as the US State Department has said.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has drastically reduced the readiness for protection seekers from around the world in recent years, with much higher admission limits under Barack Obama ’ s previous administration.
The proposed upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980, but the State Department still called the US the "most merciful and generous nation in history," a phrase that resembles the language used by the incumbent US president.
“Responsible handling ” of refugees is aimed at enabling refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild, ” Trump declared.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to close. Trump had imposed the National Emergency in order to finance the construction of a border wall. Whether there is a timeline between the current policy and current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a possible impeachment process.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on receiving two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their beliefs, and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the State Department ’ s statement suggests, while a maximum of 1500 refugees are expected from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
The US wants to ensure that people from this' northern triangle 'of Central America apply for asylum in other countries, and it is against this background that the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.

Nike ’ s New Online Marketing Strategy
Nike, the U.S. sporting goods manufacturer, has recorded a significant increase in profit despite the trade dispute with China, with net profit rising to $1.4 billion (just under $1.3 billion) in the past quarter, 25 percent more than in the previous year, as announced on Tuesday, mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which Adidas competitors direct their customers online.
Nike ’ s sales increased to $10.7 billion in the three-month period up to the end of August, boosting by 22% in China, with Beaverton in Oregon benefiting from its approach to direct consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People ’ s Republic.

Iran ’ s Dispute with the US: Rouhani ’ s End of Sanctions – Trump Contrary
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, on his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions, with the United States promising an end to all sanctions in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, said Ruhani on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, objected to the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: 'Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him for there to be a meeting; I said, of course, no'.
As Rouhani describes it, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and pressed for a meeting to take place. "And America says I lift the sanctions," said Rouhani, "The kind of penalties that should be ended have been up for debate." And they have clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions. "
However, this move was not carried out in an acceptable way, criticized Ruhani, who could not predict the outcome of negotiations, given the sanctions in force and the 'poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure'.
Earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York, with Europeans hoping to rescue the nuclear deal with Russia and China, which is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Rouhani would meet with US President Donald Trump on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Severe Earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
In the wake of two earthquakes in a very short period of time, the fear of disaster is growing, with 34 people injured in the earthquake on Tuesday, and almost 200 aftershocks since the earthquake the previous day, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday, raising concerns about disaster.
On Thursday, the earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions, and the government now to set up a commission to better prepare the for earthqu, Ok.,..
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul ’ s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
For years, city planners such as the famous architect Mücella Yapici have warned that large open areas registered as sanctuaries in the centre have long been built.
The epicenter of Thursday ’ s earthquake was in Marmara in front of Silivri district and seven kilometers deep, as Afad Civil Protection Agency reported. A smaller aftershock caused even greater street panic a few minutes later.
According to a recent report by the Turkish Ministry of Education, Research and Development, the city is in a state of emergency.
Istanbul is a city in the western part of the country, with a population of about 20,000.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude could threaten 7.1 to 7.4, but it is unclear when the earthquake will occur.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have packed so-called Go-Bags with everything they need to do next door, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth is shaking.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured, some buildings had suffered slight damage, and Istanbul ’ s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom), which reported that two minarets of mosques collapsed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning of the Nights in Istanbul
The Turkish Red Moon ’ s chief medical officer, Kerem Klinik, warned of aftershocks via Twitter, urging people to stay away from buildings that would have suffered visible damage.
The date of the earthquake is officially indicated at 1.59 p.m. (local time).
On Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 struck the Turkish Marmararegion - it was felt until Istanbul.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high, scientists believe that it will eventually unload - and will cause massive damage.
Ersoy, an earthquake researcher, predicts that the earthquake is now a warning, making it more likely, he said, to CNN Türk: "These could be signs of a major earthquake," said Ersoy on.
A few weeks ago there had already been an incident - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul - and there had been a violent earthquake in Albania only a few days ago - there were 68 injured, and the earth had also been wounded on Lake Constance this year.

Kafka Inspired by the Kakerlake: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit mess, he writes a book about it, and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka ’ s famous narrative “The Transformation, ” the UK ’ s successful author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit mess in Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on 27 November, announced by Diogenes Verlag (Zurich), about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was or in his previous life, now the most powerful man in the UK.
McEwan was quoted as saying: 'When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers shamelessly lie like Soviet leaders once, when Brexiteers in high positions almost beg the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do; there is only one answer: write.' McEwan appeared only in the spring of the novel 'Machines like me' on artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first book, published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into a tremendous insult", is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually perished. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands at its head," Diogenes Verlag said.

Thomas Cook: All journeys cancelled until October 31.
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all trips until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application.
In addition, the company has also been involved in bookings made by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or have been paid in full.
Thomas Cook in Germany was hit by the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed insolvency applications on Wednesday.
From now on, insurers want to transfer funds back to hotels.
On the other hand, as of this Friday, hotels abroad that currently host Thomas Cook holidaymakers will receive money from the insurance company Zurich-Versicherung.
On the basis of the booking information and without the presentation of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich-Speaker of the German Press Agency said.
The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
According to information from Thursday, 70 000 Thomas-Cook holiday-makers from Germany were still on the road.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
The Zurich Insurance payout now announced will only help travellers who are still on the way, but it looks bad for Thomas-Cook customers who are still on holiday.
As of November 1, 2019, the company left the field open and, in coordination with insolvency insurance, the following procedure was examined.
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, who is represented by Kaera.
Prince Harry Destroys Explosive in Angola
Prince Harry has been pursuing Lady Diana ’ s commitment for a long time now, and in Africa he is walking straight on his mother ’ s tracks.
With a blue splinter jacket, the British prince Harry has ignited and destroyed an explosive device in Angola.
On Friday morning, in front of the TV cameras, he produced the spark circuit near a British Halo Trust camp in the village of Dirico.
On the fifth day of his tour of Africa, Harry wanted to walk in the city of Huambo directly on the traces of his mother, Diana (1961-1997), with the same explosive spirit that once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go down the path that she then walked.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African tour since Monday, starting in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit Negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute.
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a clear commitment: it will not guarantee a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations; but what has been said about the polarizing British for ever; the UK Supreme Court ’ s recent judgment hangs like a sword of Damocles over the blone; its suspension of Parliament to obstruct its Brexit course until the exit date was annulled earlier this week; and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to bring about an extension of bilateral talks by 31 October in the event of failed negotiations with the EU.
Boris Johnson Keeps Deal Possible
But the pressure does not seem to be palpable to Johnson, who, when he visited a hospital, now suggested that he would support an extension of negotiations if the agreement was not reached by the end of October:
You know that we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal, I'm cautiously optimistic that it.
And time is beginning to run away from Brexit negotiators in Brussels, with the EU and British negotiators having time to prevent the UK from leaving the European Union without an agreement for about six weeks. But the recent talks have failed to achieve a breakthrough, either. An agreement by the end of October now seems rather difficult to envisage. If the British Prime Minister does not consider the law, a new postponement of the exit date will come into force, but the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister ’ s words, fearing that Johnson might somehow push Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US Authority: More E-cigarette deaths

On September 20, protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
The United Nations Security Council (UNDP), which is a member of the United Nations Security Council, has signed an agreement with the United Nations to suspend the use of nuclear weapons in the Middle East.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country, with the government blocking websites and online services in Cairo to block further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, and thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers, and activists have been detained and partially convicted in recent years.

US President Donald Trump may, after the turbulent revelations of recent days, actually face impeachment proceedings, Democrats want to examine this with their House enquiry as soon as possible - weeks before a decision is taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj is alleged to have been phoned off, and the whistleblowers who, in the end, brought the conversation to the public with his complaint out of concern for national security and democracy in the United States are monstrous: the president misused his office ’ s power to use another country ’ s government to influence the 2020 election, blackmailing Ukraine ’ s dependence and forcing it to act against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the now published co-writing of the conversation with Selenskyj, though it does not fully reflect the text. The July 25 phone call is just an episode of a much larger story, centered on Trump ’ s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public ’ s point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times reports to Rudy Giuliani ’ s travel plans for Ukraine, who wants to meet with the newly elected President Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate.
The lawyer and former New York mayor seem to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump ’ s opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had colluded with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to create an occasion for US Russia investigation, but that charge was never taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation Trump will talk about so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July, with Giulian and the president in the form of the former vice president and now promising candidate for Democratic nomination, Joe Biden, as the Obama administration ’ s Ukrainian envoy, pushing for the dismissal of Ukraine ’ s then-Attorney General, Viktor Schokin, in order to stop the gas company ’ s investigation, on whose board his son Hunter Biden worked. Biden had financial blackmail from Ukraine to cover up his family ’ s corrupt machinations.
In fact, when Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian Attorney General to go, the investigation of the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected, and Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt behavior, while the US government was far from the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal, and the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation of the company.

Will Britain ’ s government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson cautiously
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is wondering whether he is looking for ways to circumvent Parliament ’ s most recent law against an unregulated Brexit, and, on Friday, he told journalists that his government would abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the death penalty if no agreement with the EU has been reached by mid-October; Johnson criticizes this as a "surrender law" that made negotiations with the EU more difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, and that Johnson could use a procedural trick to postpone the law ’ s entry into force until after the EU exit.
Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union: 'We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way forward is through an agreement'.
Iran appears to be running high on uranium enrichment
Iran ’ s President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on the European parties in the dispute over the bailout of the historic nuclear deal. “Unfortunately, European states show inability or unwillingness to take concrete action, ” said Rouhani at a press conference on Thursday at the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York, promising“ further ” from the 2015 deal. the, the, the.., the of, the of the., the
The conflict surrounding the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb in exchange for a pledge to normalize economic relations with Tehran, led the US to withdraw from the agreement unilaterally in 2018 to force Iran to change course in the Middle East policy deemed to be aggressive, with President Donald Trump ’ s administration seeking to negotiate a new deal with tougher conditionality and now relying on tough sanctions against Tehran, most recently by restarting the treaty ’ s uranium enrichment.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared for use the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 other centrifuges, according to IAEA.
Perhaps Europeans are not willing to bear their share of the deal, leaving Iranians alone with the costs and burden of oppressive US sanctions, supposing Rouhani, but there will still be further talks, which I hope will be a solution.
Rowhani continues to deny Iran ’ s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the mix changed: Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, following Monday ’ s US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen had committed to the attack, which the United States regarded as a false commitment. “We,,,, ” Rouhanon on Wednesday.,,,,,,, and,,,,,,.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence," said Rowhani, though European leaders would not have done so in talks with him during the UN General Debate; instead, they would have called only for the rebels in Yemen not to launch an attack like this; Rouhani had met German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, Rouhani demanded that the US administration ’ s far-reaching sanctions be lifted, urging the government in Washington to switch to a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Crossing the Solar System ’ s Comet of Other
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the deep space, which was achieved before.
What was initially only a presumption is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system.
The most widely travelled comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea, with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter.
2I / Borisov, after 1I / 'Oumuamua of 2017, is only the second interstellar object that was spotted during a flight through our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get a glimpse of a foreign solar system from close quarters before it disappears to near-sightedness.
According to the analysis, the comet is on the way on a so-called hyper-plane that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as stated by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), it is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies, 2, at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and,,,,,,,,
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been spotted, leaving researchers many months to study.
A team around Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already guided the characterization of 1I / 'Oumuamua, have already targeted the visitor at two to 16 kilometers.
Researchers from the Canary Islands astrophysical institute (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar welder offering a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum resembfrom comets of solar system, the of.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors in just two years, according to the IAU, suggests that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems, but it is difficult how often these are, and one of the next interstellar visitors could possibly catch a satellite mission from the European Space Agency, Esa.
According to the research director Günther Hasinger, the agency intends to set up the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" by 2028 at a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth.
Beijing ’ s New Mega Airport Daxing
Just before the 70th anniversary of the People ’ s Republic, a first passenger aircraft from China United Airlines landed at the new mega airport in the south of China ’ s capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
China ’ s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project, and China ’ s most recent prestige project is called “Sea Star ” because of its six-pillar structure.
The complex has four take-off and landing lanes, which will be extended to seven later, and is equipped with the world ’ s largest automatic air traffic management system.
During the construction, the Chinese had already said several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing.
New supersonic aircraft is to fly in 2030: four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - this is the dream of the UK Space Agency, which is to make possible this supersonic flight (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire is developing, quoting the US channel CNN from the agency, "this is the technology that could definitively accomplish this," said Agenturchef Graham Turnock to the station.
The Concorde was the first aircraft to fly from the British capital to the Australian metropolis.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport", writes Reaction Engines on his homepage.
Rwanda in Washington: Trump wants to detect anonymous whippers in the Ukraine affair.
In the Ukraine affair over the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump wants to find possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," said Trump in front of US envoy staff at the United Nations in New York on Thursday, who was as "a spy" in the past "a bit different" from today..,,,,,,,,,
The event was not actually public, but several US media broadcasted audio recordings of the speech on Friday, and Democrats were outraged by the president ’ s statement.
The US House of Representatives ’ Democrats had announced preparations for impeachment on Trump on Tuesday, based mainly on the written complaint by an anonymous intelligence officer levying heavy charges on Trump and his headquarters. The advisor ’ s accounts had been made public at high public pressure on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants information from several government officials that the US president "uses the power of his office" to get another country to interfere in the 2020 US election in his favor.
At the center of the accusation is a controversial telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that might hurt his political rival, Joe Biden, with former deals by Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his spawn from Ukraine ’ s judiciary. Biden is ahead in the race for the democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with a view to the Ukrainian phone world: leading government officials would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover.
The New York Times reported that it was a CIA official.
In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the whistleblowers had disseminated second-hand information that turned out to be incorrect, so there may be no typing or spies at all.
But, as Trump said in New York about those who allegedly provided whistleblowers with information, he aroused outrage. US House chair Nancy Pelosi reacted alarmingly and complained that Trump ’ s statement once again undermined the government ’ s integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his environment have been underway in various committees for months. With Ukraine ’ s accusations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with new force to initiate possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
“The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation, ” said Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House ’ s Intelligence Committee, when Trump attacked ship, accused him of misrepresenting things, and again called for the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly the ship and it months ago.
More than 300 former US security and foreign-policy officials, most of whom worked under democratic, but also Republican, presidents, issued a statement on Friday behind the Democrats ’ investigation into possible impeachment. If the allegations were true, Trump would be “an unscrupulous abuse of power. ”
There is no precise timetable for the next procedure, with the Democrats ’ majority in the House of Representatives pushing for an “impeachment ” procedure, but the choice of actual impeachment would come in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority, so the prospects for such a process ’ s success are slim. No US president has yet been removed by an impeachment procedure.
VW works council: 'creeping' jobs are being dismantled.
The VW brand ’ s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe, a concern that is driving the auto manufacturer ’ s works council to reduce its annual factory costs by EUR 10 billion by 2023, of which EUR 500 million will be saved this year.
The 'Future Pact', negotiated in 2016 between the company and the works council, already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany by 2020.
As our newspaper has now learned from works councils, however, jobs in production, which are not actually available, are 'creeping' through a different path - bypassing the official course - so that vacant regular posts are often not re-filled.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility of forcing the reoccupation, but in many places there is a lack of staff, the concentration of work is increasing, and concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicle works are increasing, thus raising the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world.
The VW brand wants to standardise production worldwide and control new projects centrally, which also aims to reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and therefore competitiveness.
Tostmann, a leading German automobile manufacturer, announced today that he will be able to offer a complete range of products for the automotive industry.

The Wolfsburg plant is located in Wolfsburg, Germany.
As Tostmann, the head of production, announced last year, "perspectivivisch" is expected to roll a million cars out of the band in Wolfsburg.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg, but sales of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined, so expectations are now resting on the Golf 8.
Forced to prostitution by Voodoo: convicted of traffickers
Young women from Nigeria have been swamped, fled to the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six alleged traffickers have to go to prison.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday, with young women from Nigeria forced into the Ruhr region and forced into prostitution.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old and were transported across the Mediterranean using Libyan smugglers, but the dream of a better future did not come true, but they were distributed across different brothels in Germany to deal with the alleged smugglers' costs, on average, of EUR 25 000, and their wages were completely taken away from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted that the young Nigerian women were being injected into the trial and then distributed to brothels.
The judgments are on the commercial and ribbon entry of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo Calls for Negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm ’ s ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group has once again threatened the cabin crew ’ s union Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "inform on 14 October about the industrial action in the LH Group", announced Ufo tariff chief Daniel Flohr on Friday.
On this point, after a decision by the German Labour Court Frankfurt, Ufo decided that the collective agreements had not been terminated, and the court rejected the application, and the company confirmed the decision and tried to appeal., ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application to the Federal Employment Court in Frankfurt to have Ufo's trade union status reviewed by the courts, arguing that the trade union had not established a board of directors with the right of representation for months, thus not being able to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
It was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the Spare Trade Union, during which many members of both the Board of Management and the Advisory Council resigned, including the long-time trade union leader Nicoley Baublies.
Simplified entry: Saudi Arabia announces a new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is now to change, with the Persian Gulf country seeking to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
It is the largest city in the world, and has a population of about 250,000.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had hit two of Saudi Arabia ’ s most important oil facilities: the country ’ s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and Churais, and the country ’ s oil field subsequently plummeted national oil production, oil price shoots soaring, and it is likely to take several weeks for the Kingdom ’ s oil production to return to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber ’ s Wedding Preparations
The model was the first to present a series of photographic photos in her Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time).
Justin posted several colorful suits on Instagram, including bananas, and asked his followers: "Help me choose my wedding smoking".
A year ago, the Biebers gave themselves the word 'yes' in a New York registry office, but there was no celebration at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."

Half of Europe ’ s tree species are at risk of extinction.
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging, and the growth of cities are the causes of the threat, the IUCN World Conservation Union reported on Friday in Brussels that it has examined the stocks of all 454 species of trees known in Europe, 265 of which do not exist on any other continent, 58% of which are threatened, 66 are already at the highest risk of extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", "threatened with extinction", and "extinct in nature" to "extinct".
Eberesche and Wild Rosskastanie
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus), one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency, said: "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Balkan Miniermot, which has spread from South-East Europe since the 1980s and has scarcely natural enemies, estimates that the number of wild rose-chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe is less than 10,000.
Hard and Moose in Risk
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, bushes, and mosquitoes; more than one-fifth of molluscs and mosses, and almost half of all shrubs, according to the IUCN, are under threat, mainly due to the destruction of wilderness, infiltrated species, agricultural practices, and climate change. Weisuch as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and as food for birds and other animals.
'This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet ', said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau.' We must limit the impact of man on our ecosystems and make protection of these species a priority '.

Cook-Faite: Get Money from Insurance Hotels
According to a press report, the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook is likely to be expensive, with high write-offs on outstanding bonds and loans, including Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to carry out write-downs totaling up to £1.8 billion (roughly €2 billion) on their books, according to the report, as AlixPartners ’ estimates would have shown.
Bondholders would have to accept write-offs of £900 million to £1 billion and lenders £550 to £825 million, with the amounts actually to be write-down more likely to be at the top of the bandwidth, an expert said.
The loss of creditors in the end will become apparent after the insolvency proceedings have elapsed, and a person close to that process did not have much hope, such as Thomas Cook ’ s 40 or so aircraft in the UK were “old ” and many of the properties were in bad locations, and most of the money could be recovered by selling the airport lots and the Thomas Cook brand.
Rackets alleged to have brought murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are alleged to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but do not any," said the spokesman for the Sea-Watch refugee organization, Ruben Neugebauer, dpa news agency.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy, who are accused of raping, torturing, and killing people in Libya; the alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy; newcomers stressed that the refugee organizations could not check whom they on their ships.
On 29 June, Carola Rackete illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa, piling up a ship of the Italian financial police, on which the three suspects are said to have arrived, and the captain is being investigated for assisting illegal immigration.
Warning Federal Government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust Huawei, the Chinese network supplier.
We believe that the risks are too great, "said Pai the" Handelsblatt "with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law," which requires every company "under Chinese jurisdiction," to comply with the instructions of the security authorities.
Current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, "the FCC boss continues, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand from suppliers a "declaration of confidence".
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" on the basis of its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible, and 5G technology is not just made of hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the equipment up to date, which consists of billions of lines of code that change over time, "said Pai.
It would be "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," said the FCC boss.
He accuses Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The company that allegedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government, "said Pai the" Handelsblatt ".
The US would have insights that government officials would be placed within the company, and Pai was recently in Berlin to promote the US position.

French Finance Minister: 'Germany must invest now'
The French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, "said Le Maire on Thursday evening, when the French budget for next year was presented.
The minister warned that the eurozone economy was weakening.
We must not wait until the economic situation gets worse in order to take the necessary decisions'.
Action would have to be taken by those states that would have budgetary room for more investment, said Le Maire, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the Minister added, and pointed out its country ’ s high national debt, which is more than 98% of GDP; French public debt must be “stabilized ” and“ reduced, ” said Le Maire.
In recent years, French politicians have repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy, in exchange for repeatedly calling on France to manage its budget deficit.
The French 2020 budget presented on Thursday provides for tax breaks of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government is responding, among other things, to the Yellow Vest movement ’ s protests, with new debt falling to 2.2%, according to an expected 3.1% this year.
Is he still trying to trick?
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticizes Parliament's "surrender law".
The Tory government is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaotic bloxit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could use a loophole, but the Tory politician is evading that possibility.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is obscured by whether he wants to push through an unregulated Brexit, despite the most recent law passed by Parliament, which is precisely what he was trying to prevent. Johnson simply told journalists that his government would abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the death penalty if no agreement with the EU has been reached by mid-October; Johnson criticizes this as a "surrender law" that made negotiations with the EU more difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law; the prime minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU exit; Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way forward is an agreement.
Meanwhile, Johnson ’ s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, declared that he regarded Brexit as a “walk in the park, ” and expressed confidence that the desired exit from the EU would come true:“ We enjoy that, we will win, we will leave (Red: from the EU), not worry, ” according to Cummings, in the British newspaper Telegraph.
Cummings, who led the Brexit Vote Leave campaign during the pre-2016 EU referendum, now serves as chief strategist at Downing Street, the UK ’ s headquarters, to support the uncompromising policies that have put the prime minister in an almost impasse.
Linda McCartney's Polaroid Diaries
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera by Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers, but not always the big glamour.
Paul McCartney, married from 1969 to Linda ’ s death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the book “The Polaroid Diaries ” at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September, including Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison, and Pretenders-Frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the Launch Event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "# ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary pre-Instagram family, a celebration to the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the immediate magic of the Polaroid film".
Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she was able to take photographs, has always been with the camera, and thousands of Polaroids have done it, and several hundred of them are now published for the first time in The Polaroid Diaries.
"She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword.
McCartney was born in New York City, New York, and raised in New York City.
Like hardly any other medium, the Polorai camera captures the immediate moment.
It is a matter of deciding click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you, and then you have to kneel it at exactly the right moment, "said Paul McCartney.
"The Polaroid Diaries" is not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes seem like abstract paintings.
'We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran '
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from its neighbor, despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, "said Erdogan in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, because some companies had "withdrawn because of US threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey 'particularly on this issue and on many other issues will continue our relations with Iran', said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran ’ s oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably in recent months.
The US Government wants to Restrict Refugee Accommodation
The US government wants to slash the absorption of refugees, with the US State Department declaring on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, equivalent to a 40% cut.
The State Department has said that while the US remains committed to helping refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens, the US immigration system.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on accommodating two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country, and who are in danger, as the State Department has declared, while a maximum of 1500 refugees are expected from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
The 1980 program will select and resettle refugees from UN camps around the world, with the ceiling of 18,000 refugees for 2020 the lowest in the program ’ s history. The current ceiling of 30,000 is already low, with US President Donald Trump ’ s predecessor, Barack Obama, leaving the White House close to 85,000.
Relief organizations reacted appallingly to the announced lowering of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said International Rescue Committee Chairman David Miliband, which would further damage the US ’ s leadership role in protecting the world ’ s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US, both legally and illegally, with the US government, according to its own accounts, expecting 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year, which are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump: "Come near a nickel"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage; whoever has attributed evidence to the whistleblowers who accuse him of abusing power, “comes close to a nickel, ” Trump said, according to a record of a private event in New York on Thursday, as several US media report.
So, when asked about the person who informed the whistleblowers about contentious events in the White House, Trump said, "This is close to a nickel," and then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart?
Observers appreciated the latter remark about a possible allusion to the death penalty, with Democrats strongly criticizing Trump ’ s statements and accusing him of intimidating witnesses, and an attempt to impede a congressional inquiry into possible impeachment, the Chairmen of the House of Representatives ’ Committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Supervision.
The Whistleblower accuses the president of abusing his office to ask another country to interfere in the 2020 US election, including his controversial phone call to his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: Trump suggested that he launch an investigation into his possible democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, in Ukraine.
The Whistleblower is the largest and most influential foreign intelligence agency in the world.
Refugee Boat Killed: Baby and Infants drown in Aegean.
Time and again, people are trying to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea, often by far too small boats, and seven migrants - including five children - have died in the fall of a rubber boat.

Bubble Hire: WeWork Fears Real Estate Markets
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
In just a few years, WeWork is rising from a small start-up to a driving force in the world ’ s most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis, with landlords fearing billions of dollars in revenue.
A few days ago, founder Adam Neumann was deposed as head of the company, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months.
WeWork is one of the world ’ s leading companies in the field of corporate governance, and is one of the world ’ s leading companies in the field of corporate governance.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded rental contracts with maturities of up to 15 years, implying commitments of more than $40 billion, which could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire property markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented nearly 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months.
In the UK capital, too, the equilibrium in the real estate market could be shifted noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive start-up, including WeWork ’ s main tenant, Deka, a savings bank fund provider last year, for nearly €100 million in the centre of the financial metropolis.
WeWork is a global leader in the construction and construction of the WeWork and WeWork Group, from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia Reconfirmed Numerous North Korean Fishermen
The Russian Coastguard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen, with a total of 262 poachers in the last few days being arrested who had illegally fished in the waters, according to the Russian National Security Service FSB, reporting to the Interfax Agency on Friday.
Just ten days ago, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested, before the border guards had been shelled and three injured, and this time there were no injuries, it was said, Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages.
North Korean fishermen were thus on the road in Russian territorial waters, where Russia's coastguard, according to its own data, patrols for the protection of its marine biological resources, discovered 30,000 octopus fish, confiscated after three fishing boats and two motor boats, and transported to Vladivostok after Nachodka and Posjet.
This year, the Russian fishing authority did not issue fishing licences to the North Koreans, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been temporarily arrested in 2019, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of serious environmental damage by North Korean fishermen fishing with narrow-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia, which would also take small creatures out of the sea, and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be dismantled, and the ships themselves would not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coastguard were injured during the arrests last week, and another wounded North Koreans died later, according to the FSB, of his injuries. On that September 17, Russian border guards first set up a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened the fire.
The United States imposes an entry ban on ex-President Castro
The United States has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, as stated in a communication on Thursday by the US Department of Foreign Affairs with Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations." As head of the Caribbean Communist Party, he is heading a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
"The Cuban regime's disregard for human rights and the use of force to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump ’ s entry bans on Wednesday were, among other things, directed against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle has been raging for months between the government and the opposition, with the US imposing a series of sanctions on Maduro ’ s government to bring him to his knees and bring him to power as the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president, Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is considered to be one of Maduro ’ s closest allies, with the socialist Caribbean island receiving oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of seconded doctors.
New Fridays for Future Climate Protests
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people are now seeking to take to the streets once again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future Movement is planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world, starting with the time shift in New Zealand and Australia before the protests move across Europe to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to attend a major rally in Montreal, Canada, and in front of the White House in Washington.
Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, more more than four million people were for the climate," she wrote on Twitter.
A good third of the world's demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had, according to Fridays for Future estimates, participated in the protests in 575 German cities, a report rain cities in cities, in cities in cities such as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In August 2018, at the age of 15, Thunberg contacted the Swedish parliament to call on their country ’ s politicians to step up their efforts to combat climate change, resulting in the creation of the Fridays-for-Future movement in a short period of time, with climate protests mainly attended by pupils and students, but increasingly by scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from policymakers in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe, and, above all, the Paris climate agreement requires that global warming be reduced to below 1.5 degrees relative to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just over a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic talk with a deep-sea racing yacht, where she recently participated in United Nations climate protests and summits, and delivered an emotional speech to the UN on Monday in to the world world leaders, on Wednesday for the Nobel Prize for the Right LivFoundation for climate change.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
The Russian people will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balconies, which means a change in fire protection, "including for smoking," said a spokesman from the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow, according to the Tass Agency, which is to enter into force on 1 October.
If you smoke, you will have to pay a fine of 3,000 rubles (EUR 42.46), and if the cigarette is to cause a fire, the penalty will be higher, and according to the Ministry the cand, the, the bar,,, and.,,,,,,,,, and..,,,
Beating Cyber Crimes - Examining Server
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have, for the first time, removed a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites on which internationally active criminals operated their activities as operators of a data centre in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Mosel.
Seven suspects were arrested in a major action on Thursday evening, and Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Among the offenders ’ customers are alleged to have been the operators of the world ’ s second largest Darknet Market for Drugs, “Wall Street Market, ” which investigators crushed in the spring, and the attack 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016, according to the AttPublic, a server in the cyber bunker.
This is the first time that a host of this kind has been discontinued in Germany.
There have been searches in Germany and neighbouring countries during the access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9, which was the result of almost five years of investigation, and at lunchtime the investigators want to provide further details.
New Global Fridays for Future Climate Protests
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets once again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland in Sylt.
Climate protests – Who are Thunberg ’ s backmen?
In a world full of war and smoke factories that warm up the climate, justice and courage are high virtues, even in the twenty-first century.
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is setting the masses in motion and encouraging young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world.
In addition, Greta Thunberg has published a book that has sold extensively, thanks to her daughter in the spotlight, and Greta Thunberg's long-standing followers were a little outraged by the last public relations show, or the trip by boat was too for some of their successors, which is not without, because the campaign the world's media and it a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
It is also the case that, in the course of the World Rescue Action, certain categories of people work together with stock exchange brokers, regardless of their position, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions, and so it makes sense to question critically even seemingly pious projects by certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar Guest crosses through our solar system.
A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The astronomers have confirmed that a strange comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system.
2I / Borisov: Komet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea.
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer called Gennadi Borissov in Crimea, who looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observation confirmed his first suspicion.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain insights into a foreign solar system from close quarters.
Komet was already sighted before the start - and can be observed for several months.
Before it reaches that point, astronomers can observe it in depth, because, unlike its predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been seen in its inclination, which means that it can be investigated from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest in mid-December and will be seen with medium telescopes by April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
Initial discoveries about Komet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter, and at the same time the celestial body seems similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of welding is similar to ours. that comets in other solar could through processes similar to in, de de Le, de Lede, de de de de de de de de de de de de de
The fact that two of these objects have already been discovered in just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids frequently employ the explorers, only recently a giant asteroid rushed past the Earth and came dangerously close to them.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson appalled at Brother
His brother, Boris Johnson, became more lonely; his younger brother left the cabinet, and now his sister, in clear terms, castigates the Prime Minister's bellicose language as "distasteful." It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitalization", "fraud", "contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is continuing to arm - at least verbally - at Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, which was met with massive opposition outrage and by other: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be 'hanged, long pulled, quadrupled, tarnished, and tortured', which she found highly reprehensible, not recognizing the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnson, who stood up for the anti-Brexit Change UK party in the European Parliament elections.
She was particularly struck by the fact that her brother, Jo Cox, mentioned an EU-friendly member of the House of Commons who had been murdered by a neo-Nazis a few days before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the memory of which can best be honoured by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons. "It is very distasteful to refer to a member of parliament murdered by someone who called 'Britain first', and the perpetrator apparently came from the extreme right-wing camp, which feels' strengthened by this kind of language ', anyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and,.,,,,,
"I am sick when Jo's name is used in this way," he tweeted, and the best way to honour it is to be passionate and determined in advocating what one believes, whatever one believes, but never to "demonize the other side." He also complained that an atmosphere has arisen in which attacks have become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother, Jo, resigned his post as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory MP. "I have been torn between loyalty to the family and the national interest in recent months - it is an indelible tension," Jo. Jo Johnson.
As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language 'unworthy of that country' and, in a joint statement, they said: 'In recent days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside Parliament, and we should speak with respect'.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez compete in the Super Bowl
The NFL marks the 100th anniversary of its existence: in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latin roots appear, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show on Thursday (local time) at the upcoming NFL Football League finals.
"I feel incredibly honoured and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," said Shakira in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th anniversary next year, will take place on 2 February in Miami.
"I love the Super Bowl putting two women on the stage this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez, sending an important message to all Americans and the world, promising "an explosion of fun and energy" for the show.
Lopez was born in New York City after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico.
Shakira was known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer, making her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of mid-term guests is expected every time in the US, and many this year see selection as a political gesture, because the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump ’ s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sporting event and a gigantic advertising spectacle.
In the early 1990s, the band had a reputation for being one of the most successful bands in the world.
An actor and Youtuber admits Egypt ’ s ruler: for now, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have had an influence on the flow of blood on Egypt's streets have spent the past week both abroad, one of whom flowed back to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly; the former general who deposed the Muslim Brotherhood Mohammed Mursi, the country's first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump praised Sisi's actions against political Islam and did not lose a syllable about human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president.
Mohamed Ali has, of course, remained abroad, evading the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he attempted to enter Egyptian territory.
In his second job as a builder, he seems to know very well what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as shown by the explosion of clicks.
After thousands of people protested against his rule for the first time since Sisi's grip on power last week, and nearly 2,000 citizens, including prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers, and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million march" this Friday, which meant that so many people really would dare to take to the streets, but there were occasional small protests, such as in Giseh near Cairo and in Kina near Luxor, where videos in social media showed protests that Al-Sisi accused of corruption and demanded his departure.
On Friday, a massive police presence was reported from the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where protesters cracked banners with the president ’ s portrait last week; security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the failure roads; several underground stations in downtown Cairo were closed for “maintenance work, ” most streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked; and Rabaa Square, where supporters of the ousted Muslim Brotherhood Morsi were locked up in 2013, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, was designed to prevent dissatisfaction from gathering together: Sisi ’ s Future Party wanted to hold a major demonstration for the president.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square," said Ali in his video camera in Barcelona, "Let police," but: "All Egypt is Tahrir Square".
If Provider Promises Too Much
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities.
If you sign an Internet contract, you don ’ t have to blindly trust the speed information provided by the providers, and customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved in the event of attacks.
After all, the pre-promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre Bavaria.
If the connection always appears much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test possibilities, for example the measuring tools of the Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to vendor specific requirements and are therefore not calculated in a uniform and objective manner," says the Consumer Centre Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is considerably slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable time limit of 14 days for the supplier to produce the promised service.
If this does not affect anything even after multiple requests, customers may terminate and claim damages.
First Corporal Republicans for Investigation
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it leads from here, it is determined by the facts that are being established," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday, wanting to know more about the whistleblowers before taking action - an impeachment procedure may lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, for Trump observed Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far been reluctant to criticize Trump for the Whistleblowers affair; few have shown unease. Scott ’ s statements are the first sign in Trump ’ s party, and Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as loosening environmental legislation and tightening immigration rules.

Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat failure
One baby and four other children drowned in the Aegean when a refugee boat was captured, and seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coastguard reported on Friday.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland, and four children, three women and five men.
At the moment, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are migrating to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wanted to 'find out what the refugee situation is like' in Turkey, said Seehofer on Friday, and then in Athens he wanted to learn more about the 'administrative problems of the Greeks' in order to be able to help deal with them..
On Friday, a spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed Seehofer ’ s planned trip with EU interior commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France ’ s interior minister Christophe Castaner.
On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increase in numbers has recently cast doubt on the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants illegally arriving through Turkey on the Greek islands, in exchange for receiving a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each Syrian deported.
Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, have nearly 29 400 people left to deal with asylum applications, the worst of which is the situation in Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with capacities for 650 people.
Never since the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact entered into force in March 2016 has it been so many, the State Radio reported.

The Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo pan.
Elizabeth May, Canadian Green leader in the election campaign, was the Becher rigged for that reason?
The Canadian Green Leader holds a multi-way bottle in her hand in a photo, but now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - It has been a long time gone unnoticed - and finally noticed.
Green Leader Responsible for Photosline
The National Post then accused May of manipulation, and that Fake News produced fake news to appear more credible on the issue of environmental protection, in the midst of an election campaign to the House of Commons, in which Trudeau, too, finds it increasingly difficult to do so because of a bribery scandal.
The photograph was viral in the social media and raised the discussion about fake news.
May was shocked and told on her blog that she didn ’ t know about this action, and to underline that, she immediately posted the original: she, talking to citizens, had a cup in her hand, but she correctly put it out of bamboo, and she always got him there, and a party spokeswoman said that it was only a matter of putting the party logo in the picture, not covering it up.
May writes that she is suffering for the collaborator who has done so: 'I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide', she says to the Guardians, and at the same time she asks something of her over-committed team: 'If they want to work on an image again, could they not do what with my face, so I look younger?'
The German Greens have also come to Shitstorms for their use of disposable plastic or for air travel - but their pictures were not fancy otoshoppt.
Influencer wants a free upgrade: A Lifelong Ban on Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was alleged to have received an upgrade from Cathay Pacific by mail, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Get a Business Class upgrade spontaneously - many passengers dream of it - sometimes they are lucky, and check-in staff offer a free Economy class change.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-proclaimed influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade.
Jaqueline was the first woman in the United States to have been a member of the United States Air Force.
Jaqueline is a member of the JFK International Airport (IATA: ICAO), a member of the JFK International Airport.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific.
With her case, the influenza therapist turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influenza therapist has committed fraud, remains suspended for future flights, and the airline ’ s terms and conditions also state that she does not have to pay the new flight.
Oil prices reflect a ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices plummeted by more than one dollar on Friday lunchtime, costing a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea strain Brent $61.83 – about 1.4 percent less than the previous day.
The Kursrutsch was triggered by a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil facilities had stalled 5% of global oil production, with the Houthi rebels allied with Iran in Yemen ’ s civil war country claiming the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran, and a ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region.
If an agreement is reached, it will be possible to focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Commodity Strategy Department at Saxo Bank of Bloomberg News Agency.
Oil prices are continuing its downward movement in recent days, with a barrel of WTI oil cost nearly $59 a week ago, Brent nearly $65.
More recently, by invoking insiders, Bloomberg reported that oil repair work in Saudi Arabia was progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September, with output reaching eight million barrels a day and moving back toward the original quantity.
Most recently, insiders cited press reports of rapid progress by Saudi Aramco ’ s state-owned oil company in repairs, but commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock market launch to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after Iran ’ s arrest and the recent release on the way to leaving the port.
But the US announced that it would move defensive missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia as Iran ’ s arch-enemy. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and the United Kingdom had temporarily pushed up oil prices significantly.
Accusations of Trump He
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up charges have been raised against the White House, with several senior officials working hard to prevent access to the conversation after a contentious telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, as an anonymous adviser said, with the Speaker of the House, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly calling the White House "cover-up." Trump spoke of a witch-hunt. "
North Korea regards Trump and Kim ’ s Third Summit as questionable.
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be held in the nuclear dispute. The meaning and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of a lack of progress in implementing the first-summit agreement in Singapore, said senior diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA agency.
The US has so far done nothing to implement the summit ’ s decisions last year, said the North Korean State Department ’ s adviser, criticizing tougher US sanctions and joint military exercises by the US and South Korea, but hoping for a “wise ” and“ courageous ” decision by Trump to restore rapprochement.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he agrees. Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program have stalled since Trump and Kim ’ s failed second summit in Hanoi in February, and both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states in June, agreeing to revive the talks, but without much success.

Pound under Pressure - Expected to cut interest rates
British Pound Under Pressure
With interest rates down soon, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculated that the Bank of England (BoE) would soon cut interest rates to the pound sterling, with the British currency reduced by 0.4% to $1.226on Friday.
The sales triggered statements by central banker Michael Saunder, who suggested cutting interest rates even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, because the uncertainty would affect the UK economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, because Saunders was a champion of restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already referred to the economic burden of the Brexit hickhack without signaling a direct cut in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to leave the EU, even without a divorce agreement, on October 31.
Moreover, with his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: More Russian Manipulations Faced
Material from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former Director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and now Head of Integrity of the World Athletics Association.
In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport was revealed, after which the Wada had blocked the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years, during which time Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage.
Positive findings missing
In the following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada Bann, but demanded access to the laboratory and the samples in question.
However, the Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes, we received the data nine months ago and we should check whether the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in Friday's interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
The World Cup Not Afflicted
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: the athletics association is the only organisation that holds the Russian flag.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada Manipulations had already launched and called on Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks, and Russia is now threatening to open the Rusada again and, at worst, to exclude the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
