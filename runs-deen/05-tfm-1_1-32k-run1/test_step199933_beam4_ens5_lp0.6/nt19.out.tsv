Treysa has to fight with vandalism and the Unrat .	-3.9075
The entrance to the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired .	-5.5163
Recipes against the rampant vandalism , but solutions are hardly emerging .	-3.6067
Scherben , cigarette kibs , garbage and unrat , demolished dustbin and now dismantled signs - this has been presented for a long time with the entry group to the Radweg on the Haaße-Hill in Treysa .	-9.8777

The problem has already been raised in the Committee on Transport .	-3.4073
There is no solution .	-2.8792

Volunteers would have already reported more frequently , ADFC member Susanne Klippert .	-3.9089
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean .	-3.1240
You are annoying that the Rastplatz on the Radweg in Treysa meeting point for Sau.	-4.9961
" Along the entire cycle path it is situated on the Haaße-Hill , the Radomomomer , which is now also the new radar facility in Ziegenhain , which is now opened .	-10.8792
" Make the same fate , it is quite expensive ' .	-4.6404
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill : " Perhaps the threshold is significantly higher to reach common good .	-6.6911
But that would then require a police strike at a close time .	-4.6068
In principle , Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the Haaße-Hügel .	-3.1899
It must be more attractive .	-1.7138
The frequency of the radar system has so far been very satisfied with the frequency of radar .	-6.4297

Musik-Contest im Kulturbahnhof : Die " Kö von Hiltrup " und der See der See " .	-3.8686
The first call to the music contest was a success , creative and co-existence .	-3.3708
" D a song for Hiltrup " is the appeal of the city 's participation offensive Hiltrup , in the " Music contest for large and small , young and experienced musicians " .	-5.1699
A contest " with eyelids in the sympathetic Hiltruper family " , as Karl Franke said .	-4.8945
In fact , it was soon a family co-existence with coffee and cakes of the Honorary Office of Culture .	-7.8651
Seven formations took place , from the Ein-Mann-Band to the great ensemble : Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied , Henk Humberg with guitar , Rolf Ihmig , a long in Hiltrup living Albachtener , the Neun of Hiltruper Sternfarben , three members and three generations of Trenkamp and Claus , an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties .	-6.1713
This contest , declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt , was a novelty .	-3.5334
We have not yet seen that in other parts of the city .	-2.8260
What were the textures ?	-4.5713
In the places the Hiltruper See and market allee especially frequently mentioned .	-5.7376
Rolf Ihmig the Allee in his striking song to the " Kö von Hiltrup " .	-4.5754
The cultural station was also appreciated .	-2.8481
Time and again it was about the experience of co-existence in these places , especially at Alvin Jasic .	-4.8695
Karl Franke belebte the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their work .	-5.4967
So he learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry , but now also guitar .	-5.5431
Franke ’ s Tontechnician Stefan Schemmelmann knew that the recent meeting in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest .	-7.0049
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed on Youtube .	-2.8431
" It is not about winning " , Franke said .	-2.6938
In fact , all participants received a gift from Hiltruper gastronomy . . .	-5.6960
For the favorites of the jury , there was something special - so that others can hear their songs .	-6.0260
A whole CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann .	-2.4906
Other musicians can record a song : Ihmig with his help drums , the Franke especially with his music , and the " Lummerland-Rudel " : " a very beautiful performance " with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon , Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle .	-6.5244
Like everyone , children joined the finals once again - and even without electronic support " right " , as Franke said .	-6.1835
The jury was inspired by the aspects of originality , reference to Hiltrup , intransigence of melody and recognition .	-6.2909
The jury belonged Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik , Andreas Klomfaß von KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahler from the economic verbund as well as Jan Kaven , Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive .	-4.8486
The city ’ s part offensive had created the event of its ten-year anniversary .	-6.7881
It valued the event as a full success .	-2.9025
All are " very satisfied " and " the atmosphere was good " in the near future very full cultural station .	-4.5099
The word game : " Decrypto " in the game etest .	-4.1880
The players are two teams facing each other .	-2.9859
For each side there is a visibility screen , four cards with keywords that can be removed - the old trick with the red slide - only if you have hidden them .	-7.1492
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything .	-4.8436
On the cards , for example , from left to right : " 1 Renaissance .	-4.6594
2 .	-0.9581
3 .	-0.6164
4 . Fest " .	-2.2320
These are the terms that must be encrypted .	-2.3217
Because guns are not supposed to guess but codes .	-4.6870
Changing a player per team is the encryption .	-2.7890
He gets a code card that may be " 3.4.2 " .	-3.4564
Errates are not supposed to be listed in " Decrypto " , but their encryption codes .	-6.6828
His task in this case : He should - in this order and in this example - the terms " dice " , " Fest " and " windows " - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opponent team will not be able to crack the code .	-8.1303
The encoder notes and reads loud : " Werfen " for the dice , " Lose " as opposed to feast , " Lose " as opposed to feast ; here would of course also be as " party " and " Prague " because he was in school and knows the windows there .	-9.7710
This is the way round , team for team .	-5.9267
You do not know the terms of the other side - but you can get together with any indication that the encryption there is better .	-10.6181
Perhaps mysterious , but not to be turned off , the changeover is so difficult for his team .	-7.4295
