The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas , an offer by the federal government ’ s Geoport of Bavaria , are far from current – but instructive .	-6.0853
Especially when you compare them with current online cards .	-2.8417
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century .	-3.7353
The digital Bayern atlas is a patchwork that you don 't recognize as such .	-3.7806
The large map for cities and municipalities has been incorporated into more detailed maps , so-called primal position sheets .	-6.1377
According to the Bavarian survey administration , these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .	-5.1041
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.4715
The French army leader occupied Bavaria from the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-4.2604
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and ordered a topographical reception of Bavaria - obviously for military purposes .	-3.8870
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9 , 1801 , it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern map . of , , , , , and . , , , , , , , ,	-9.1261
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian Geographic Administration .	-4.5226
The Munich Urpositionsblatt dates back to 1856 and , like all the others , can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek .	-7.4450
The comparison Sooner / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .	-4.7349
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.1460
An example of this is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.7283
Sendling was incorporated into Munich as a district 21 years after the map was created , in 1877 .	-4.5355
Today Untersendling is located in the heart of the city .	-3.2559
The Untersendling houses are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserserstrasse , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-4.9994
Where the West Park is today , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : at the Hinzomen , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : handwriting numbered pieces from the so-called " Uraufnahme " , from which the property tax was derived .	-7.6842
Today , small plots no longer occupy farmers there , but rather small gardeners at the ' land in sun ' facility .	-6.8410
A large green area is north of Untersendling .	-2.8857
The Theresienwiese , the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810 , was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-3.4064
On the other side of the Isar , the historical card gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.7541
In the Urpositionsblatt , in the area of today 's Au-Haidhausen district , one reads not only the street name " am Gasteig " or " Auf der Lüften " - but also in large letters " Irun Anstalt " .	-6.2365
Yes , people with delusions were once locked up on Auerfeldstrasse .	-3.4270
In 1858 / 59 the Munich district art " Auf der Auer Lüften " was born .	-4.5309
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .	-4.8874
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the arrival of the so-called madmen .	-3.7732
In addition , he has prohibited the personnel from using violence against the inmates , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Haidhausen , who has worked with the institution for an exhibition .	-5.8062
There was room for 280 patients at first , and then it was extended to 500 places .	-5.6823
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreismannstalt in hair in 1905 .	-6.0538
Since 2006 , the Isar Amper hospital in Munich-Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatry , has been located there .	-5.7580

Marienplatz was listed as " Hauptplatz " around 1856 , Kaufingerstraße was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-3.9239
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-2.9422
In December 1944 , the Allied bombing broke many holes into the city centre .	-4.6896
A big one remained until today - at Marienhof .	-3.8694
The English Institute , small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work was carried out these days and on 5 April 2017 the spade for the second S-Bahn train line .	-6.8662
With the slider you can compare the old map of Munich with the aerial picture of today - and fill up the hole at Marienhof .	-8.7041
Civil Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri	-1.9585
The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning to colored people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-4.4184
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travellers , visitors and revisionists to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling through the state , as a number of questionable , racist incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here , " said the group 's opinion .	-7.6541
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination actions , as well as state law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities , led the group to issue the travel warning , NAACP said .	-4.5527
" You have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-2.8010
They are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten up or killed , " said the president of the Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-3.2436
'We hear complaints at such frequency that we have not heard yet ' .	-2.7101
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-2.4517
The group cited incidents like racial offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black Tennessee man .	-2.6595
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year , after he had no gasoline left during the state trip and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .	-5.1175
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri , which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 % more likely than white drivers .	-5.7370
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri , " Chapel said .	-3.0027
'People must be prepared to bring bail or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state . '	-5.0179
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crimes trial program , which rank the state to 16th in terms of the number of such violations .	-4.4537
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.6959
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration offences , which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling .	-4.7783
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries , but lately , interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.9608
Project of Weight is Fundamental	-5.9524
The FischerWeideaun project in Munich is a successful project and will continue next year .	-4.7924
The CDU MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on the ground .	-4.7153
At the " Rechtgrabenhof " of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies .	-5.9650
Markus Schwendemann gave insights into his farm , where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and hosts holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.7589
For him , " Black Forest milk " is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , says Schwendemann .	-4.0843
The guests ’ tables are exclusively regional .	-4.9665
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the Weidewand project " elementary important " .	-4.3107
I cannot make a profit on such steep areas .	-3.7353
The green area makes for a lot of work , much needs to be done with the Motorsense .	-5.8031
" We are struggling with conditions and topography here , " said Schwendemann .	-3.3421
In 2003 , he took over the family business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not run a organic farm .	-5.0129
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidewanderprojekt and is glad about the Leader promotion " .	-5.4664
The cost of EUR 3 000 to 4 000 per hectare would require support for farmers .	-3.5832
It is hoped that this would allow afforestation to continue for a long time .	-5.0994
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business , " said the mayor .	-5.1446
Farmers are often criticised for their promotion .	-3.6911
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced in through the promotion of pasture .	-4.6428
The remaining area is 40 hectares , which must not be replanted by at least 2023 .	-5.0390
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was supported by Leader , a quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischerbach .	-4.2789
This left farmers with EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of willow trees .	-4.4066
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-2.7005
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You are doing a good job , without farmers and rural women it is not possible " .	-4.9633
Peter Weiß also said : " Here are the best food produced " .	-4.2512
The Landschaftsbeschreibung ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of grassy trees .	-6.2882
The aim is to preserve the Black Forest .	-2.8655
A prerequisite is the existence of a support framework defined by the LPR .	-5.3845
Moreover , the area to be fenced must not be traceable to tractors ( more than 35 % of the slope ) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation .	-7.3814
For the Fischerbach Weideaunprojekt 2018 , the application of eight participants is under way with 24 plots that want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence .	-6.2236
The remaining area is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-4.8151
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.1710
Trump ’ s White House is now taking the Statue of Liberty	-2.3219
The surest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .	-2.3256
Americans appreciate it , as do any others - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad ’ s Firdo Square in 2003 .	-4.7284
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta about the president ’ s proposals to slash legal immigration .	-3.1055
To be fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.9221
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have hated him if he had .	-4.3054
But it took on its importance , and in particular the importance attributed to it when Emma Lazarus 's famous poem was added to its base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-5.3835
As Miller called Acosta , " I don 't want to go into a whole thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world .	-3.7188
The poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '	-2.4382
Miller is factually correct , but as he put it himself , this is not really about history .	-3.4752
It is about the contemporary response to Lazarus 's shouting words , the only one in which a state invites not just any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " Your mosquitoes , your poor , / your crowded masses who long to breathe freely / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . "	-6.7738
There was never a time when the ' miserable waste ' on our screens was better visible .	-3.1696
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.8559
This conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-3.9209
Lazarus - and her friends who tried to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they did a highly political act .	-5.2547
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a time-worn classic visual representation .	-6.6587
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-5.4802
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of the exiles .	-2.4349
The combination of poetry with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.2797
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the right wing people wanted to change it a long time ago .	-7.6429
The great scream of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative , bringing the American flame into the world that is being reinterpreted : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-6.5898
It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.1640
The torch should not clear the way to the United States . '	-3.0694
Quite unusual here is Limbaugh .	-4.0247
The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the position of perception .	-3.0229
Lazarus 's great imaginative act was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , wretched but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-5.6443
It is literally a question of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-2.7151
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-2.8148
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-3.1730
Their torch is not intended to enlighten the way , but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power .	-3.6204
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team .	-2.4624
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were in the UK team .	-2.8702
The performance director of UK athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup will ' make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-4.5616
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.4371
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and that the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn from it .	-3.4310
" We welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , " said Black .	-2.0760
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.5007
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.4799
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-1.7026
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.5872
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.6731
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team .	-5.7577
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.7203
Her chapter speech was incredible , " says Black .	-3.9674
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated .	-3.4334
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally gave was great . "	-4.1806
The Commonwealth Silver medal winner , who will compete at the fifth World Championships in the 400m hurdles , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-4.6848
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes in the World Cup so far was seven , reached in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.7128
The midrange runner Muir is on this path and has set five British and two European records last year .	-4.8789
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .	-3.0018
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1.500 m , is another Scot to be seen after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-5.1671
Doyle remembers her first World Championship when the only other Scot in Team Lee McConnell was .	-3.8405
The team captain says that she is " immensely proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team , but will also , in some cases , be involved in the medals and finals .	-5.1399
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me makes it a very special thing for me , " she added .	-5.3894
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-1.9256
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.6468
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to get on podium .	-4.0829
As regards my speech as a captain ?	-2.8884
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.5382
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .	-3.8553
So it is really important to count on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-3.8343
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . '	-3.4551
Blocking critics over Facebook : Don ’ t worry about public office if you can ’ t tolerate voters ’ heating up .	-4.8920
The father of our country knew something about bad press .	-2.7680
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles .	-3.1471
He railed at the critique , sure .	-3.8191
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.2402
For in 1783 Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dumb , we are being slaughtered like sheep ' .	-4.4567
This brings me to Maryland to become Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.4175
Hogan ’ s staff blocked and deleted the entries from at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-4.9960
The American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him earlier this week .	-1.9188
The staff of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Well , and ? " .	-2.7446
" It 's just Facebook , " many people said .	-1.6369
But it is important .	-0.6757
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.5933
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular .	-2.2046
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.5485
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead .	-1.1340
He has shown a firm hand in the governance of his state and strict adherence to principles .	-3.3302
He was also very adept at using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his constituents and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side .	-4.1957
It is therefore unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people on the side of the governor - who is a public forum , who is called official and who are paid with public tax dollars .	-5.8951
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesperson , Amelia Chasse , defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation .	-3.1799
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people wielding the whip online .	-3.4460
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-2.4804
And these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , not trolls .	-3.5127
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profound .	-1.9164
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-2.2317
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , MEP , was not hated , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.5217
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the news program " The Post " .	-3.6946
" Nor do I value this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then some disrespect it more as a so-called collective effort and do not recognise it as a large group of citizens affected . "	-7.0182
What the governor 's staff called a " concentrated spam attack " would probably be called " advocacy " by others .	-3.4308
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.4794
It is much cleaner than it was in the past to have done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-4.5174
But that is what is happening digitally .	-2.6814
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-1.9252
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.7375
One of the first milestones on this issue came last week in Virginia .	-2.0899
The chairman of Loudoun County ’ s Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to US Supreme Court judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she expelled a voter from her Facebook page .	-8.1862
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-1.7957
This should not be so difficult .	-1.7246
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet .	-3.1345
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters appealed to his leadership .	-2.8821
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.2794
The people who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all the letters to Washington 's decisions .	-4.5970
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity , Trade , and Shipping with the United Kingdom overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project .	-4.5381
But he did not silence them .	-1.4233
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourses are at the heart of our nation .	-9.0145
And true leadership means accepting it .	-1.2392
Ronan Rafflety hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club	-3.3525

Passive smoking reduces lung cancer deaths .	-7.8928
In the last two decades , fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.5124
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) study this findings .	-4.6456
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year , " said Heiko Becher , director of studies .	-4.3907
As a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .	-4.7015
At that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases per year in Germany due to passive smoking .	-3.1439
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-2.4440
Domestic connections prove to be very complex .	-2.1701
The construction works on Villinger Straße are in full swing and " are reasonably in time " , says the head of the building Fred Heinze .	-5.3297
In the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than anticipated , because much is hidden underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .	-6.0645
The traffic , which repeatedly obstructs the construction work , is a major problem for the Stumpp company .	-5.4343
" The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and shutters is enormous , " says Heinze .	-4.0791

In 2015 alone , Freeport has mined gold and copper worth $ 3.1 billion .	-2.5868
Papua also has an estimated $ 78 billion of wood resources .	-2.2058
These riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence .	-4.1353
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost $ 20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.5086

Indonesian President Joko Widodo , commonly known as Jokowi , promised during his 2014 campaign to address the inequalities and violations of rights in Papua .	-3.5814
The former carpenter secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.0717
But little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel betrayed .	-3.0749
" Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , expecting him to fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-3.5010

On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-3.0392
The starved children told them that they should turn on their headlights .	-3.3550
One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Yavet Tebai .	-4.4869
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifles , said victims and witnesses .	-3.9688
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.9162
A child , 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma .	-2.8617
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was burned , and things escalated the next day .	-3.1814
About 1,000 young Papua men , women , and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .	-3.5136
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - in the circle , imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe .	-5.5809
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts .	-4.9823
When the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers over an internal radio : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " says an official TIME document that was not released to the local media .	-5.4881
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali , saw the imminent danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home .	-3.8633
Nobody was in the mood to listen .	-1.3738
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his brightly painted wooden house .	-2.7405
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .	-3.1147

According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured .	-1.9516
The news of the killings came to Jakarta only the following day ' filtered ' .	-2.6825
Three weeks in Jayapura , Jokowi gave a passionate speech expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical grievances in Papua .	-3.2635
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-2.8572
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations .	-3.9750
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.2707
" Most injuries have occurred long ago .	-1.7145
Some were in the 90 's and the beginning of the 2000 's .	-3.3582
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that need to be gone through , ' he said .	-3.7319
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua .	-3.1970
Instead , " everything is regulated by law , " he said .	-2.2104
Wiranto , accused by the UN of ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor 's bloody 1999 referendum on independence , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved , including the Paniai incident .	-4.0046
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with fierce disbelief .	-2.4590
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.9417

" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.3963
'I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . '	-7.6513
His brother , Yasobus , repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-5.7159
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-2.3021

The shootings have not stopped .	-1.3085
On Tuesday , Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai ’ s neighborhood , Deiyai .	-2.0591
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .	-2.7737
The man , 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who drowned when he fished in a nearby river , died on his way to hospital .	-2.1675
Recorded villagers protested before the company ’ s location office .	-3.3018
The police said that villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-2.3472
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) started shooting at the crowd and killed one .	-2.5541
" We were so panicking , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed the quick delivery of the injured , according to the TIME .	-5.4181
'I have been hiding in my house for two days ' .	-5.2317
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area .	-2.8314
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian Government .	-1.9585
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribe Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal , who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.9014
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and abductions by Indonesian soldiers .	-8.7106
Some of the top OPM guides come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-2.0540
In response , thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-2.8748
Some never appear again .	-1.9733
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.8424
Poverty reinforces discontent .	-1.8932
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-2.1019
Bread is just as beyond reach .	-2.1142
The people here are building everything they eat : especially Nota and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-4.3687
Agriculture is the job of women , who can deal with four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .	-3.9454
They keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.6583
Ten pieces Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.6251
Over time , economic inequalities between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants have increased since the opening of new flight routes to the Nabire airport .	-4.0555
The few jobs that exist in the region typically go to better-educated and wealthier migrants .	-2.6952
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills needed to run its own businesses competitive .	-3.5826
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , head of the Paniai tribal council .	-4.0199
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.3235
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain tense international media .	-3.5194
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , although they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.4905
According to Phelim Kine , Human Rights Watch ’ s Deputy Asia Director , the promises made by Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-4.3445
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa denial and a blacklist , " he said in a statement .	-3.8571
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-2.9887
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread injuries ' in Papua , including the Paniai Shooting .	-3.5822
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-1.6278
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Arrmanatha Nasir , dismissed the group 's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' Indonesia still has a democratic system and there is free media , making it difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.5746
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-7.7081
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and pressured him " We want freedom " , according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous .	-4.4377
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi .	-2.4631
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the paniai bullets , " says Gobai , the leader of the tribal council .	-5.0849
He wants Jokowi to know that , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , the Paniai people are in poor education and health services .	-3.1430
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their vote for Jokowi as a " debt " that he must repay .	-3.7646
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.2766
Despite the threats and intimidation , the families of the Paniai victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance : the body of a victim was buried on a site in front of the police and the military station .	-5.4032
They know that they may never get justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .	-3.5617
" A member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with his head lowered .	-3.6105

Fire capture Dubai 's ' Torch ' skyscraper for the second time .	-2.4112
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high 79-floor building .	-4.0265
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise building in just two years , which is coincidentally called the Torch Tower ( torch tower ) .	-5.3710
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.0544
" We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and at the shouting of people .	-6.9733
We ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor , " said a resident who named George , Reuters .	-4.2583
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that fire-fighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building around 4.00 a.m. local time ( midnight GMT ) .	-4.6479
The government said that it is working to provide shelter to those affected .	-2.7315
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outlying high-rise areas around the world .	-4.1941
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the fairing , the outer fairing for decoration or insulation .	-5.5688
In the United Kingdom , the police said that they believe that the system of panels for insulation and facing at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people .	-5.2827
No Davis Cup reform : Next Best of five	-3.5122
The President of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has failed with his large Davis-Cup Coup at the General Assembly .	-4.1671
At the Ho-Chi-Minh City meeting , the proposal revolutionary for this sport to play Davis-Cup-singles on only two sets of wins was hardly supported by the two-thirds majority required .	-6.8745
The five-piece classic , which is often very long , but also very much appreciated for that reason , is thus preserved by the traditional competition .	-6.8688
63.54 % of member states voted in favour of reform , so ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal was only narrowly missed .	-4.2037
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not adopt the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-2.7982
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic contests , " said Haggerty .	-2.7148
They will continue to work to improve the competition .	-5.8341
Not for the vote in the first place , after many objections , the proposal to complete the final in a neutral place had already been made .	-5.8679
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the next year ’ s first round .	-4.2376
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers , the training grounds requirements and so on will be made easier and players will have to meet less official media dates before the Davis Cup .	-6.8145
More than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring prohibited items into the aircraft , find out a poll .	-5.6299
A flight passenger survey found that more than 20 % deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 % who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades .	-4.7194
Less than 1 % claimed that they were belatedly discovering that they mistakenly traveled with guns , ammunition , or explosives .	-6.7371
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travelers tend to disregard the rules .	-4.3142
Of the respondents who admitted that they had knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % that were members of Generation X .	-3.6156
The most common items deliberately bypassed TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.5357
More than 3 % admitted that they had knowingly carried objects with blades through security checks , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft .	-5.3008
The company said it had consulted travelers across the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled goods through airport security and how many would have done it deliberately .	-4.7630
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unwittingly - through security were those who fly most frequently .	-4.5111
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.6565
People are often unsure about what liquids they can take with them or how much of it .	-3.8548
So it is no surprise that the largest number of prohibited liquids seized by TSA are .	-3.7753
For a while , people thought that TSA could treat books as contraband .	-3.0690
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.8328
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order	-2.4982
Elektro-Wintersassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for its new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-4.5302
So far , he has failed to understand that some of the customers have already withdrawn their no-obligation reservation .	-6.4489
In addition to the increasingly triumphant figures on sales increases and gigantic sales targets , Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time a different , less glittering figure when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet : the cancellation of the new mass-market model 3 .	-7.6212
Musk often advertised in recent months with more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .	-4.8337
Now Musk admits : of the 518,000 preliminary orders , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-4.1507
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-3.0527
In case of cancellation , Tesla will fully refund the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 and UK £ 1000 ) " reservation deposit " .	-4.7666
At the moment , 455,000 such no-obligation reservations had been made , and Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts .	-5.1107
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling around 12 percent of all orders could be a problem .	-4.2863
His argument is that the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-3.2813
Last year Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles .	-1.9084
In 2018 - all models put together - there will be 500,000 , and in 2020 there will be one million .	-4.2307
The demand for this is obvious .	-2.5733
There are currently 1800 reservations per day , according to Musk .	-2.6160
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions to maximum utilization .	-5.5002
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.4217
However , if there are major delays , the non-binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-5.4189
After all , the company cannot prevent discontented customers from running away in droves .	-4.2813
Europe ’ s leader , Pruitt , withdraws from the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions because of its .	-6.6771
A day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the Environmental Protection Agency ’ s chief , retracted his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama era ’ s rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants .	-4.3945
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved itself to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-4.5745
He did not mention the lawsuit against his former post in a federal appeal court .	-3.6334
It is a deadline set on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-3.5504
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time , study the plan , and avoid “ interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth . ”	-3.7514
Pruitt , a public prosecutor for Oklahoma before he was appointed by President Donald Trump , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .	-3.7995
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry oppose .	-3.4505
Wednesday ’ s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback to the Pruitt regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.3162
Last month , a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority by attempting to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-4.0680
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his U-turn in ozone standards simply reinforce CEPOL ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-3.9425
" Under previous administrations , CEPOL often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others , and to set the deadline for implementation in an agreement , " said Pruitt , who sued CEPOL more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-4.9744
" We do not believe in judicial regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-1.8856
We also take seriously the law and the authority that we have . '	-2.6937
Nevertheless , the EPO ’ s statement said that Pruitt will at some point use its " belated power and all other legally available powers " to ensure that the rules are " based on sound policies and the best available information " .	-5.9545
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a more comprehensive overhaul of ozone rules .	-2.6651
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.5068
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.7222
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiterman , who led the coalition of states that had sued the CEPOL this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.9941
" The reversal of CEPOL - after our complaints - is an important health and safety gain from these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities , " Schneiderman said .	-4.8362
In this case , New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-6.0022
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemical plants and other atmospheric sources react to sunlight .	-3.0010
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in vulnerable groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .	-2.7852
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered about Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-3.1572

750 years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old Friedhof area in Tumplingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.30 .	-5.0230
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius complex a popular place to stay .	-4.1891
Visitors to the sixth benefit spa can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-4.4023
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made friends and patrons of Tumlingen their concern .	-4.7682
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village gem " .	-2.5644
In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in a document in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the nearby parish church at Tumplingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .	-4.7822
According to the letter of the document , apart from the former parish church , there was also a stately courtyard on the Tumminger Berg , to which the church or the right of patronage belonged , and not the other way round .	-6.9629
They also lived there .	-2.9100
As the Oberamt Freudenstadt ( Oberamt Freudenstadt ) described in 1858 , next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumplingen , the " Berg " was the third , stately settlement centre of the village .	-7.1424
Old maps from the period around 1600 confirm this historical reality .	-3.8662
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval right to a church .	-5.7325
A Lord who built , furnished and occupied a church with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could inherit this own church .	-5.9272
This was accompanied by the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .	-4.4140
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-2.0264
The larger ones disintegrated at Christmas 1673 .	-3.6513
In 1692 , the newly erected bells sounded for the first time , but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942 .	-10.7901
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the windows were cracked and the bells were stolen .	-4.4535
The roof was leaking .	-1.5825
In 1796 , French troops stormed near the church .	-2.7153
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-2.5843
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-2.6171
Until 1869 , the Tumminger Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from horns .	-4.7307
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Church of Hilarius was abandoned .	-3.4246
Only the church tower was left standing .	-2.9052
In the New Year 's Eve in 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .	-3.3875
In order to prevent an accident , the tower was cut off .	-4.9005
Only the Tower Tower Tower , which still exists today , was preserved as a witness to the 750 year old church history .	-4.4826
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the " Schaffigen Pensionen " , as successor to Dieter Dockhorn , care for the Hilarius plant .	-4.7596
On Sunday , July 16 , the friends and patrons of Tumlingen invite to the sixth Serenade at the old cemetery of the St. Hilarius Chapel .	-6.4536
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-3.9724
The local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word .	-3.7090
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.8180
Entry is from 3.30 p.m.	-3.1824
To finish the Serenade , a runk takes place in front of the cemetery .	-4.8453
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest " , the organizers highlight the fantastic view .	-4.6616
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-2.8385
The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius plant , which is important for Tumplingen and Hörschweiler .	-5.3277
Friends and patrons of Tumlingen are particularly committed to home care , as Serenade organizer Walter Martini has confirmed .	-6.7875
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines verified .	-4.8531
" Boisheim resists " does not see any legal condition for the construction and has therefore contacted the Landrat .	-4.8117
The association " Boisheim resists " has asked the regional council Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette .	-5.4751
It was unlawful .	-1.6412
The association argues that , at the time of its approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at all at the Boisheim Nette , since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind concentration zone at the city border with Schwalmtal .	-7.0370
Within this concentration zone the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone results in the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .	-5.4121
Such zones are intended to prevent a " barrier " of the landscape .	-5.1055
Although the town of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier by amending the land use plan , this had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf , due to a formal error .	-7.4396
" Due to the lack of a planning legal requirement , the issued permit certificate is still unlawful and therefore also withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim resists himself " .	-7.0735
Current state of affairs : before the summer recess the city council decided again the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette ; a permit from the district government is pending .	-9.6589
According to the statement : " This makes it legally impossible to grant permission for the construction of wind power plants " .	-6.6427
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.8801
" The relevant letters have been received by the circle of Viersen since last week , " said a speaker .	-4.2385
The circle gives them the opportunity to look again at the matter .	-4.0442
However , they are unlikely to stop the process .	-3.1855
In view of ongoing proceedings at the administrative court , the circle did not want to comment on the arguments of the association " Boisheim resists itself " on Thursday .	-5.7911
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four 200-meter wind turbines on an area on the Nette Boisheim River .	-5.0980
Last year , the company , in which the town of Viersen is indirectly involved , closed lease income with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .	-5.0945
The four wind turbines are designed to meet the electricity requirements of around 11 400 households - roughly one-fifth of the electricity requirements of all Viersen .	-5.3034
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .	-3.4071
Last summer the town council of Viersen gave the green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in Gesac-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg .	-5.6238
Car and tractor scrape together : Mrs dies in terrible accident	-5.2512
One terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel ( Rhein-Lahn county ) .	-3.5815

City and traders are planning " Home Shoppings " weekend	-3.9343
Bad Langensalzburg and people from the region are to rediscover shopping in the city centre in September .	-4.6470
The Gewerbeverein and the City Hall want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice the inhabitants to go shopping in the city centre .	-6.1308
As the chairman of the Gewerbeverein , Christian König , announced , the " Home Shoppings " weekend is intended to raise the awareness of the offers offered by the city apart from the usual supermarket goods .	-7.4298
It is therefore planned to have a market with regional operators , similar to the weekly market .	-4.6534
In addition , domestic companies will present their training places .	-4.7585
In addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to " midnight shopping " .	-4.8487
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .	-5.6979
According to Christian König , there are commercials on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that indicate the weekend of action .	-6.2396
The City Council and the Commercial Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry . from to , and . of , , and , and . .	-9.2370
The Gewerbeverein and the city thus go into another stage of the project " Attractive downtown " .	-4.7916
This includes new offers such as the first " active day " to the Brunnenfest , including an open Sunday for sale , talks with all traders and hosts to get them actively involved .	-7.0382
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .	-4.0164
In addition , customer potential is to be re-developed or re-developed .	-4.7340
This includes spa guests and tourists .	-2.2590
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre while shopping .	-3.5883
In the end , everyone would have to contribute to the revitalisation of the city centre , including landlords , businesses throughout the city and associations .	-5.5426
King said in the spring that he had to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly spread .	-5.0184
Birgit Stress , head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , announced that the third " home shop " day , five Thuringian cities will participate for the first time in Germany .	-5.5842
In addition to Bad Langensalta , this is Weimar , Södigerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-4.5468
The day should " promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities " , Streit says .	-5.3155
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen with his / her buying behaviour can influence his / her direct environment .	-5.5660

During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .	-2.3841
New people were injured .	-1.6470
A gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis killed two people and injured nine others , some of them severely .	-2.7054
According to the fire brigade , on Wednesday ( local time ) an injured person was still in critical condition .	-5.0062
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion .	-2.9114
A missing person was also killed later .	-5.0540
The dead were school employees .	-1.8824
As an accident , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .	-3.0742
At the time , few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building .	-4.1642
After leaked transcripts of telephone calls , Trump put Mexico under pressure to pay the border wall .	-3.0661
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-2.2567
On January 27 , Trump telephoned Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.7073
The US President insulted him for openly denouncing the wall and reportedly said to him : ' You cannot tell the press . '	-4.8285
Trump started his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the US southern border and vowing to have Mexico pay for the project .	-3.4754
Transcripts of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbul were also released and revealed a tense exchange .	-3.0560
Mr. Trump said that trade for the US would be " ridiculous " for refugees who emigrated to Australia , " " bad " and " stupid " , and that insisting on trade conveyed by the Obama administration would make him look like a " Depp " after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-6.4743
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull that ' this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-4.4456
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : Activists resurrect racist lynchak as a call for justice .	-7.5209
A 1948-year-old Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and caught up on Moore 's Ford Bridge .	-4.4950
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with guns to block its way .	-3.1907
The mob ’ s leader – a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit – took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield .	-4.8565
Inside , the inmates were in fear .	-3.2120
" We want these n ---- r Roger ! " the man shouted .	-3.4261
'Get him out of the car ! '	-1.5570
Calls torn the silence when a young black man was torn apart by the front-passenger seat .	-4.0880
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a sequel .	-3.6036
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " almost everyone in the audience cast very real sighs .	-4.6255
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to emulate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.4627
No one has ever been charged with the murders .	-2.3037
" It is truly inconceivable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities even though we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organise the succession .	-5.6317
'It is a dirt stain on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . '	-2.6139
Brooks is a 71-year-old former member of the Georgia State Congress and a lifelong civil rights activist .	-3.1331
For him , deferment serves as a dramatic call for action , and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.2760
" We want law enforcement , we want ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-2.9934
'We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-3.0306
A forensic physician lays a blanket over the corpse of one of the victims of Moore-Ford lynch on July 27 , 1946 .	-4.6601
According to FBI files received by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process .	-4.2112
But no one has ever been charged .	-1.7582
Although suspects have remained at large for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-8.5684
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court ruling enabled Georgia ’ s black citizens to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign .	-3.7476
Around the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner , Barnett Hester , down during a fight - allegedly for a woman .	-3.7731
Brooks said that the rumour in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom 's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .	-4.3250
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to release Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-2.3979
Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey went to prison .	-2.6614
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynchmob surrounded the car .	-3.1982
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes an FBI report .	-2.7499
'It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution , which not only involved in the murders , removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses ' .	-8.8439
Brooks puts it even more succinctly .	-1.9071
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.4736
'You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and if you vote , it will happen to you here . ' . is . , , , , , , , , , , and .	-8.2281
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene led the annual sequel to Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-2.7360
Their depiction is vivid , moving and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America .	-4.6151
It is hard to watch and even harder to look the other way , but greens said that is the point .	-3.8221
" We don 't want to talk about lynching , because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-3.9070
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you don 't want to listen to me or you don 't want to hear what I have gone through " .	-3.9476
The rehearsals for this year ’ s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors – a dozen whites and the rest blacks – rushed into a room and listened when Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the piece .	-5.6175
Wade Marbaugh is Green 's co-director here .	-1.6879
He has been the chief clan member for years , but he said the role would never be easier .	-3.3145
" I feel dirty because I 'm not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.9580
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times ' .	-2.7325
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.0296
The play begins with Malcom , who hits Hester and hits him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-4.8688
'I said n --- he , conspire with my property ! '	-2.9646
The fire returns quickly .	-3.0603
There is a pause .	-1.1160
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-2.7413
Greene laughs the loudest .	-2.3153
" What ? ! " Rascona asked .	-1.5209
He is alarmed and confused .	-1.3663
Was I too tough ?	-1.1702
" No , " said Greene , still kidding .	-2.2846
'I simply do not think that white people said ' n --- he ' at the time . ' . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.6398
" But " , joked one of the other black actors .	-3.1931
'You only have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-2.1816
And that is where the energy is shifting in space , a feeling of comradeship replaces unease .	-5.0451
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-2.7315
The scene starts again .	-1.4855
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and emphatically .	-3.4639
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.4541
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-1.7973
There are shouts , shots and then silence .	-1.4787
A woman dressed with a mourning dress stands above the actors ' bodies and gives Billie Holidays mourning praises " Strange Fruit " .	-4.6772
Your voice breaks every second word .	-2.0891
About a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sweeps and tears from their eyes .	-4.9079
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .	-1.9395
A couple has come from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many just down the street .	-4.4628
Every nearly eight hours , Brooks has experienced the stifling moisture of Georgia when she travels on a pilgrimage to the tomb of the Malcoms and Dorsey .	-6.6827
Until that point , the murders have remained anecdote , but now that you are in the same country where the Lynch murders have taken place , the air feels spooky .	-5.1972
When the final notes of the song end , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body .	-4.3488
Children hover at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other .	-3.8980
" They are not really dead , " a little boy mutters as if he wanted to remember .	-4.1830
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it 's over .	-2.8641
The actors throw the lynch away and wipe their tears .	-2.3944
Bradshaw embraced Marbaugh , the man in the suit who played the clan member .	-1.7268
Nick Rascona hugged two of his fellow players and then cried in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .	-6.1427
" It 's okay , " whispers one of the women .	-1.7377
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.8849
You did so for one reason . '	-1.6050
Later , the audience met with the actors for dinner .	-3.3586
At a table , a white pair from Atlanta chats animated about the rendition with a black pair they have just met .	-5.8574
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that made the performance feel .	-3.3537
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you , " she said .	-6.5940
'What this really does with me leads me to believe that the lynch is still continuing ' , she added , ' today it is only called police action ' .	-5.5699
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks ’ court holds at his table , he eats and remembers citizens ’ .	-5.7656
He said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .	-2.8874
" The posturing is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.4408
" If we do not learn from it , it can happen again .	-3.6126
Those who do not study their own history , those who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat them . '	-2.8835
" Twilight of the Gods " reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth	-2.7052
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf is also using a colourful , frivole staging against a gigantic , six-storey backdrop .	-5.5236
The revolving stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) features either a shabby street corner with masonry and Dönerbude in Berlin , a " plastic and elaste " logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-5.6253
Prior to that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhinetöchter posing as a rockergirl , or alternatively an Isetta .	-7.1279
Enchanted oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf 's leitmotif - Money , Power and Greed - that draws through his " ring " production .	-5.6932
The three Rhine butchers - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmbkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise as they did in the " Rheingold " .	-4.8305

Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty hail that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer .	-3.2231
Brutal the scene when he shot Siegfried .	-2.7621
Later Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) must believe .	-4.0180
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .	-2.1329
It is a great celebration for Foster , Milling , Vinke and conductor Janowski , who gives his hands a modest and formally bowing to the merkel-rout .	-8.9321
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which is showing itself for the first time on stage - in the face of the great heat again in casual casual casual casual clothes .	-7.1991
The performance was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his director team .	-3.6522
Five years later , if he had to undergo a gelling whistling concert in 2013 , there was great jubilation in which the sporadic " buh " roast fell .	-8.6177
The festival director Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this .	-5.0680
" One notices that the audience has somehow grown up with the " Ring " , " she said shortly before the performance of the dpa .	-5.1945
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but also an understanding of his view grew .	-4.5682
I draw a positive conclusion .	-2.0313

On May 31 , a massive bombing at the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since the US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001 .	-3.1123
The violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Trump is weighing up increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country .	-3.5433
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani .	-6.5159
CEPOL Reverses its decision to delay the Smog Rule after Complaints	-3.9016
The US Environmental Protection Agency has rescinded a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , which requires states to reduce smog-causing emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move .	-4.9540
CEPOL announced late on Wednesday the decision to push ahead with the so-called ' ozone provisions 2015 ' and said that it showed the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-5.2715
" We believe in dialogue and in responding to our state partners , " said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.9222
In June , Pruitt announced the CEPOL ’ s intention to delay ozone regulations – which will measure emissions of pollutants in one part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards – in order to delay one year until October 2018 .	-5.6278
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the Colombian district , filed a complaint on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal .	-3.5920
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has sought to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump claims is intended to boost economic growth .	-4.5129
The effort , however , has triggered the setback of the Democrats and nature conservation groups , which worry about the impact of major emissions on public health .	-4.9445
The website of CEPOL says that inhaling air containing ozone can " reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms " such as asthma .	-3.5832
Town council wants community area	-4.0807
In the end , the decision was clear : in the event of two votes against , the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a common area in the future residential area for senior citizens .	-4.8877
Before the discussion there is an important information : The purchase contract for the missing property has been signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-4.0664
While it will take time for the parish to be in municipal ownership , there is no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be run by a private investor .	-7.2029
There is a discussion about a Community area .	-3.5827
One of the two investors still on the boat has offered to meet the community .	-3.8130
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square metres for a special price .	-4.0328
The administration and the majority of the municipal council have in mind that such a common space should not be used as a meeting point only for the residents of the senior-related housing , but should be openly integrated into the community .	-8.2782
As an example , the word " knitting café " went round .	-3.7493
The decision made in advance by providing funds for the current budget last autumn will be sweetened by means of funding opportunities .	-12.3288
The building is located in the rehabilitation area .	-3.1866
The creation of a Community area would be eligible , according to Tjaden , at 60 % of 30 % .	-3.5766
The proposal for a resolution , in order to signal to the investor that they do not want to put a spanner between their legs in this respect , states that both the saddle - similar to the surrounding construction - and the canopy - which would reduce the height of the grapes and make the construction more economical , would be possible .	-8.6193
Not only Wilfried Sohmer says that this addition is unnecessary .	-3.8840
If it helps , it happens unanimously .	-4.2202
The common area is not so easy .	-3.3105
Daniela 's reputation refers to the many buildings that you do not really make progress with , but now you are turning your back on the window in the common room , she says : ' I 'm doing a lot of trouble with it ' .	-11.2467
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common space - but absolutely against communal participation .	-4.6508
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to already wealthy people or even foreign investors .	-4.3562
That is not the case , because if you buy the area , you do not give a subsidy , but get real value for money , which can be marketed in case of doubt , is the objection .	-7.7402
Staiger 's proposal to split the proposal for a resolution accordingly has three supporters .	-5.3051
This leaves two votes against the original programme , which Stefan Haller sums up : " If we take the decision in this way , we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure " .	-8.5467
Vehicle collision : Radler on the road	-4.6585
On Wednesday in Garath , an 82-year-old cyclist crossed the road and was seriously injured .	-4.9962
As the police said , the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his bike at 12.20 p.m. on the cycle path of the Schwarzer Weg road from the direction of Hilden .	-6.6467
The senior wanted to cross the road at the top of the road at the Buchholzer Busch .	-4.6213
He was given priority by a car driver travelling in the same direction .	-4.1228
When Langenfelder took to the road , however , he apparently did not pay attention to the other traffic .	-6.7358
He met with a car steering a 66-year-old Hildenerin .	-3.9665
The man was thrown onto the streets .	-2.5227
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital with a rescue vehicle .	-3.2875
FC Bayern München has to renounce David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund .	-3.8598
The Supercup takes place without him : David Alaba has to let the game run against Dortmund .	-3.6912
The FC Bayern will travel with personnel care to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .	-4.9561
Seven professionals miss the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner .	-4.4627
Die Personalsorgen beim deutschen Fußball-Recordmeister Bayern München werden vor dem Supercup am Samstag ( 20.30 Uhr / ZDF und Eurosport ) bei Pokästeiger Borussia Dortmund immer größter .	-6.8649
In the duel with the BVB , coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to renounce David Alaba .	-5.3356
That was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .	-6.3850
Also missing are the miners Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat .	-2.6639
For the five defeats in the last six test games , Ancorotti blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .	-4.9246
" We know that we are not in the best physical condition , " said Anconotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-3.5275
That was not good at the end . '	-2.8606
However , the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory season .	-3.8704
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.3490
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .	-2.1452
The team is ready .	-0.7129
We want to play intelligently , " said Ancellotti , who expects a " difficult , intensive game " .	-3.7108
The duel of the two German soccer heavyweights captivates the fans .	-2.7439
The match is sold out with 81,360 viewers , informed the German Football League ( DFL ) on Friday .	-3.6517
Walking in the Harz of Stern	-1.8840
The first star trail in Germany is to be created in the Harz Mountains .	-4.7151
The Verein Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg is planning this .	-2.7297
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.7989
A " star path " meets the information needs of many visitors to Harz , it was said .	-4.0467
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.8432
Members wish to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-4.3733
In a first phase until 2018 , the association plans " well-attainable installations in five to six places " in the Upper Harz .	-4.8020
St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hoegeiß and Sieber would be called into question .	-5.7778
The information on the tables is to be added via Internet .	-3.9771
This is why a good mobile network reception is important when choosing a location .	-5.0932
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.0353
Later , the star trail Zug will be extended by train .	-4.5814
" On the starwalk trail , visitors learn a lot of interesting things , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " the association explained .	-5.5578
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star is stronger than another , even though it is much farther away .	-4.6225
It also tells you which constellation a selected star is in and when it is best to see .	-5.1836
Since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest astronomical observatory in North Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-7.6034
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-3.1733
From there , the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen with the naked eye .	-4.0576
Since 2003 Göttingen has had something similar to the planned Planetarium - the Planetarium Trail .	-5.5845
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the Mount Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an " extraterrestrial " location in Diemarden ( municipality of Gleien ) with the planet Sedna .	-6.9415
The steals with the individual planets - including Pluto at the end point , degraded to the dwarf planet - are situated exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-6.6266
The earth shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away sun measures 70 centimeters .	-7.7527
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres .	-3.3939
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto .	-4.4338
Pedestrians are faster than the light in space .	-2.0368
But the march to the next fixed star would take six months .	-3.0456
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown .	-2.7932
Vascol Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under £ 147 , met for the first time on Thursday .	-4.2261
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the clumsy World Boxing Council lightweight champion , went down to welcome Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Champion .	-3.6226
After Garcia 's victory by unanimous decision over the former four-divisional world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the Top Five Pound-for Pound-list .	-4.0883
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-3.6351
I wish you good luck . '	-1.4394
Lomachenko defended his belt against Miguel Marriaga at 7 p.m. on Saturday evening at ESPN .	-3.9971
When the pair posed for photos , Lomachenko Manager Egi Klima realized that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect order " .	-4.1601
" I am a former feather weight , " recalled Garcia .	-1.6933
" I went up for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-2.7438
I am small for 140 .	-0.8636
I would like to come down to light weight .	-3.1840
And he must move on lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.3391
That is what fans demand .	-2.3349
Let us give them that ' .	-1.6874
Lomachenko agreed .	-1.2984
'Boxes need this fight ' .	-1.9334
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachanko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) , which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares Luke Campbell after their lightweight fight in the Forum on September 23 .	-5.1578
" This battle could take place in pay-per-view mode , because all fans asked for it , " Garcia said , and later expressed himself openly , to fight on the network that offers the best financial package .	-8.2583
We are the best .	-0.5611
No other names can generate this kind of attention .	-2.0200
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.4034
Garcia said that he regarded Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter , " and that he might be taking part in his Saturday fight .	-5.4851
But Lomachenko held the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought Riverside 's tri-fight champion was " very slow , sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out " .	-7.4656
Garcia said the focus is to show hit strength , then boxing .	-2.6469
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own struggle .	-3.2054
" This is the battle that must be conducted .	-2.5582
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.1782
I am more than happy to work on this , " said Garcia .	-2.1438
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.6732
It will be a great fight . '	-2.0404
Four injuries after tyre burners	-3.5291
In the event of an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon four people were partially seriously injured .	-3.7885
According to initial information , the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his vehicle after a tyre user at around 4.30 p.m. shortly before the Marktrotz .	-6.9929
The car slipped to the right into the eviction , where it passed over and then remained on the roof in the green strip .	-7.5719
The four passengers - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident .	-3.4087
The A7 was closed to the north for about an hour during the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , after which traffic on the left lane could pass by the accident site .	-7.4668
Forkuna Hoffmann : ' Tripartite chain works better '	-2.6449
After 2 : 2 on the season opening against Braunschweig , Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the defence formation in Aue points out .	-4.4553
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season , but with the result too , if not the two opposite players at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-7.6595
" These were two opposite goals too much , and we need to be even more careful in Aue , " says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.7332
In the Ore Mountains , the three-way chain is to be further optimized .	-4.3846
And a gate after a freekick does not want to catch the Fortunes anymore .	-7.5326
'For the future , it will be the case that no one will stand alongside Michael ( Rensing ) . '	-5.2168
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better on the basis of experience in the preparation of the three-way chain than on the four-wheeled chain .	-7.0754
" I do not yet know how we will act in Aue , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but his cause is certain , " because we have just in the three-way chain on the half-positions in KaHoffmann to Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann players who can build well , " Hoffmann said .	-7.4090
'Condition is , but we need to be even more harmonious and we do not afford so many play-errors . '	-7.4651
Of course Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game .	-3.2926
" But whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw does not know .	-4.1156
The performance could be quite okay , " Hoffmann said .	-3.9114
'If , however , we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season ' .	-5.4344
His coach did not want to know about this .	-3.5979
" I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of the match , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the match of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm .	-5.7965
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann , who believes that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher , as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna for a career favorite in the bones .	-7.1027
" But they do not know exactly where they are at the moment , " says the internal defender of Fortuna .	-4.2102
It is true that the guests from the Rhineland as an easy favourite go to the meeting at the ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday .	-5.8962
" It is nonsense that we are throwing them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six , " says Funkel , whose record is quite positive in only one defeat against Aue from nine games .	-7.3276
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset , " explains Forunas Chief Coach .	-5.6300
'Making such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant ' .	-1.9643
And so Funkel doesn 't want to experience his players on Sunday .	-3.8224
New results of Sweden 's Asylum Age Tests	-4.1828
The recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these findings .	-4.9014
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority ( Rättsmedicinalverkeet ) has started to carry out the tests last year .	-4.5644
They are supposed to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Administration ( Migration Coach ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-6.3700
To date , migration statistics have sent 6,880 cases to be tested , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-4.9737
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-4.0640
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years old " .	-2.4571
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-7.3675
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-2.8086
" We see no big difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant , " he said to The Local magazine .	-3.7506
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his or her age .	-3.5130
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases ' proposing that the person in question be 18 years or older ' .	-3.4585
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the 581 published findings , it found that in 243 of these cases , the person had frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-3.7978
The method of medical age assessment in which X-ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticized in some areas .	-5.1118
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether sooner or later they passed through puberty .	-3.5008
" I had reason to think about it and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.5709
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.4677
If we cannot say it safely , we should not act as if we could , ' he said to the Metro newspaper .	-3.4233
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .	-3.7788
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 % . '	-4.1708
Full in the Plan	-2.1483
Work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.5892
On Wednesday , a seven ton heavy concrete section of the bridge was installed at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-7.7355
" We are very good in the time , it is running super " , says Reinhold Leicht , construction manager at the Department of Road Management and Traffic at the government headquarters of Freiburg .	-7.3186
In April the work began simultaneously on all three bridges in need of reconstruction between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-3.7408
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is met .	-4.3535
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads over the Trombach .	-2.5058
It is a vaulted arch bridge of concrete covered with red stone and has a total length of 4.80 metres .	-4.3702
It was built in 1900 .	-1.2446
Like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .	-3.0968
In order to ensure durability and road safety , the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated .	-3.7904
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach .	-2.1676
They are made of red coloured stone .	-3.8005
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.60 metres long .	-3.5057
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter wide and seven metric ton ' bridge ' cap on Wednesday morning .	-5.5894
This is a side fortification which is also used as an operating route .	-4.8179
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap will be used on Friday .	-4.6643
The pedestrian path should then follow .	-4.4293
The special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-5.6144
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-1.9535
The building in Lauterbach requires a special touch of sensitivity when laying lines .	-6.1726
There is also a fiber-optic cable to which many companies are connected .	-3.9483
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand papers .	-5.3668
In addition , fish and cancer had to be caught first .	-3.6800
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collector ’ s pond in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .	-6.0809
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " is completely closed .	-4.7645
The total cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000 .	-2.9530
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-2.7504
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunched protests at German potato salad	-2.8139
It is not so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative für Deutschland ( AfD ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconcile .	-7.3978
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel ( CDU , SPD , Grüne , FDP , FWG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peacefully the flag on this day , because the AfD invites to the poster " big campaign opening " in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell .	-6.1082
And with familiar names , such as Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the leading duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beatrix of Storch .	-7.1843
But those who are there hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to AfD students , but to demonstrate .	-4.5927
The motto " The Eifel remains colorful " .	-1.9529
The city picnic was originally planned under the motto " All at a Table " on the Brunnenplatz , but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - right in front of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle .	-6.9524
A colourful picture that can be seen here .	-5.7747
And what Christa Karoli , chairman of the Forum One World and one of the relevant organizers , really enjoys : " Great how many people have met here " .	-5.1105
There is music and a lot of food , including a " German potato salad , which the AfD could easily eat , " says the woman who brought him with him .	-5.4494
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , and they are also present at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .	-6.0098
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-1.7813
Mario Hompes reported from the AfD Volcanic Eifel that he was trying to get such an event and was awarded the contract .	-6.3573
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially inquired in Daun , but had received a cancellation there because of the already built up Laurentiuskirmes there are not enough parking spaces .	-6.7124
Now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a beautiful event here " .	-3.0513
Looking at the event at the Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the right of people , the main thing is that it remains peaceful " .	-4.3578
This is also the case : Towards 8 p.m. a band provides entertainment at Rondellvorplatz , and various speakers in the Stadthalle , including the Rhineland-Palatinate leader Uwe Junge .	-6.6764
There are about 200 people in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the Deputy Chairman Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches .	-5.6304
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.0242
The AfD event lasts for a little more than an hour , while the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath , but there is also a need to clean up shortly after 9 pm .	-7.9242
The police can move away - no special events .	-3.5992
Trombone meets Trumpet	-1.9014
There will be a rehearing with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli in the series Haslacher monastic concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .	-5.9290
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto " Black Sea meets Black Forest " , or even " Balkan folklore " meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .	-3.8974
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras .	-3.1775
Petkov is the solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the solo trumpeter of the SWR Symphonic Orchestra .	-3.0455
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .	-4.5048
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds in a new guise , Daniel Schnyder 's " World Music " is combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece " Exchange Suite " by jazz pianist Nils Wogram , classical music , jazz and free play are combined into a fascinating overall piece of art .	-7.9404
This core of the programme was first launched in Freiburg this spring with great success .	-4.1360
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Haslacher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert .	-4.5264
Kristen Stewart speaks of her bisexuality .	-1.8962
" Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .	-1.6988
But I want to try it out " , says Kristen Stewart quite openly about her bisexuality .	-3.5405
'Once I bite in grilled cheese , I think : ' Oh that was cool , what comes next ? '	-4.4622
The most famous relationship of Hollywood star was with Robert Pattinson , her " Twilight " colleague , who ultimately fell apart bitterly .	-6.4771
In spite of all this , the young actress assures the " Harper 's Bazaar " magazine : " I was seriously in love with everyone I wrote .	-5.6207
Or do you think I have played it ? '	-2.6464
After her separation , Kristen admitted that she was bisexual : " I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism .	-3.7989
So I have never been confused or obstructed .	-2.0674
I have never liked not to be taken seriously . '	-2.6232
She suffered especially from this , according to " Bang Showbiz " but in school time , when she preferred to dress like a bub : " Not all girls are typical girls .	-6.5117
That really did hurt me .	-3.2139

Whether you like it or not , the democrats have moved away from me , " said Governor Justice .	-2.2746
'Today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection ... today , as a resident of West Virginia , I will tell you that I cannot help you any more if I am a democratic governor . '	-4.6606
The rally erupted in jubilation .	-2.5083

Meanwhile , on Thursday evening , the National Republican Committee issued a statement saying : ' The change of government by Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again ' .	-4.5672

Coe praises ' honest ' Russian apology for doping scandal	-2.3513
The global leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to return to sport .	-4.6202
Russia ’ s athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country ’ s exile from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .	-3.8280
He said he was sorry for " all athletes caught gold and silver medals in competitions " .	-3.6127
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.1364
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-2.2451
'The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realised to itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is reorganised . '	-5.2207
Coe said he was also ' pleased ' that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction .	-2.6161
'I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the task force 's recommendations that this is not the time to reinstate Russia , ' said Coe .	-3.0947
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation .	-2.9457
The guiding principle has always been to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system , " he added .	-2.9631
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players in the World Athletics Championships that begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IAAF criteria .	-4.9683

At a funeral in Fritzlar in northern Hesse , around 1000 people of the two soldiers died in a helicopter crash in Mali .	-4.7588
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Cathedral City under high security conditions .	-3.2827
Minister of Defense Ursula von der Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing about the still unresolved crash case .	-3.5296
However , she called the two former pilots the " experts of her profession " .	-5.3141
" We salute this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she explained .	-3.2260

At noon , only the members of the church initially fared .	-3.9358
After that , the funeral began in the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics .	-5.1688
These included Hessen ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker .	-2.8975
Traumers laid down roses , relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins .	-4.4240
In front of the church Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas .	-3.4022
Minister of Defense of the Leyen described the converted soldiers as ' highly decorated ' and operational .	-5.2968
Stabshauptmann helped establish the operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment .	-4.5957
Volker Bauersachs , commander of the regime , to which the soldiers belong , also said : ' If this occupation could not prevent the crash , no one would have been able to do so ' .	-5.4281
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali were not expressed by Minister of the Law : the operation was dangerous .	-5.3054
But it was also very important ' for a country from which we are separated by only two states ' , she said .	-3.5220
After the funeral the coffins were taken out of the cathedral .	-4.7175
When and where they are buried , the Bundeswehr did not provide any information about this .	-3.9889

The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-2.9583
That was announced by the royal house on Thursday .	-2.8615
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple are buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-3.4654
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.0690
The Queen agreed with her husband ’ s decision , as stated in the communication .	-4.0202
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear .	-1.7438
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .	-3.6251
Prince Henrik had never concealed the fact that he was unhappy with his title .	-5.2988
After ascending the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would have liked to have become king .	-3.8296
In 2016 , he retired , with the title " Prinzgemahl " .	-4.7321
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark , he does not regard himself as equal to his wife - even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief spokesperson of the Danish royal house .	-5.7012
Where the final resting place of the 83-year-old will be , it is still unclear .	-3.8786

Prime Minister Weil ’ s Rapid Reelection	-1.9218
The CDU and the FDP before Possible Majority in Lower Saxony	-2.6258
Niedersachsen 's prime minister , Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country 's parliament after the loss of the Red-Green government majority , but he does not want to resign .	-6.0612
Because on Friday it was in favour of Parliament being dissolved .	-3.4741
Prior to this , the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her state parliament group in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-5.6130
Five months before the official date of the regional election , the red-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition of the CDU and FDP .	-4.4669
Elke Twetten , a former Green MEP , founded her move on a non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency of Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-5.0067
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hannover .	-2.2687
The CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to include them .	-3.9656
Together , the CDU and the FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Congress , the SPD and the Greens , with 68 seats .	-4.8725
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-2.0109
The new Land Day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-3.9952
Thümler said that the red-green regional government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.4542
Stephan Weil , however , considers it essential that the Land Day decides on its own dissolution as soon as possible .	-5.0172
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats will on Tuesday .	-10.5202
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the day of the country would deprive the Prime Minister of his confidence and elect a successor .	-6.4225
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.2429
These possibilities need to be examined in legal terms , " said Thümler .	-5.3829
'We shall calmly discuss all the issues when they are legally properly examined ' .	-5.6428
Thümler called Tweestens step " doch ein kurios " .	-2.2341
The politician herself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-2.3157
I feel very good ' .	-1.0331
She called herself a black-green supporter .	-3.4422
The Greens called on the renegade members to return their country 's mandate .	-4.1631
" We assume , of course , that she will immediately return her regional mandate , which she received through the Green Country List , " said the country 's president , Meta Janssen-Kucz , and Stefan Körner .	-7.2081
The chairman of the Green Group , Anja Piel , said : ' We very much regret the decision of Elke Twetten ' .	-3.6738
She has deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group .	-3.1008
'Nor can we understand this step , given that there were no differences of substance . '	-4.9172
SPD chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twetten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-4.6982
" The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters , but also a betrayal of the Rot-Grün , " wrote the Federal Chief of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .	-4.8596
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to have the country ’ s parliament elected quickly .	-4.3516
The exit Tweest costs Rot-Grün in Niedersachsen the majority .	-3.8245
The politician , " in her wounded vanity and in her frustration , put her personal interests before the welfare of the country , " criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-4.6645
'It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony is playing this dirty game of intrigue and trying to make political capital of it ' .	-3.7038
Niedersachsen 's CDU leader , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend his deputy to join the CDU , Elke .	-6.2023
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppenmann , accused Twetten of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 regional election with personal career thinking .	-4.8124

Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.5247
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.8621
How did the scandal happen ?	-1.6520
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.2098
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is speaking and answering in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.3313
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves against poisoned eggs ?	-4.7829
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your fridge and to check the stamp .	-3.5843
On the consumer protection portal www.Food Warng.de , the federal states provide the latest information on the egg charges concerned .	-6.2321
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.3219
Even if , after everything we know at the moment , there is virtually no risk to health .	-4.8185
Does Aldi now have the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educator is not really being played by the Federal Agriculture Minister ?	-5.0299
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states .	-2.2692
Nevertheless , my House has immediately opened its doors and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the German crisis became known .	-6.0655
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.0736
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health .	-3.9416
If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded in the case of eggs , they are not transportable .	-4.5618
However , unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed .	-2.7678
This time it is not the farms that are to blame .	-2.6276
Do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?	-2.6730
The current state of knowledge is that production companies are not directly to blame .	-4.4865
Instead , they face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service providers .	-4.2870
As always , there are too few inspectors in the event of an emergency .	-3.5325
Is it just a matter of staff or of coherent competence ?	-5.2338
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.4281
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 % .	-3.4432
It is precisely for this reason that it is essential to provide consistent information on these events and to hand over them to the prosecution authorities in cases where criminal offences can be committed .	-7.3055
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the responsible authorities .	-3.2170
Is regular alarm really necessary in the case of food scandals ?	-3.2789
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable food .	-2.8985
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-1.9971
Manufacturers , dealers and consumers have been placed in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary by the patched means .	-6.1825
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of animals which are delivered by life is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-6.3323
This must be done consistently and at all levels .	-3.1937
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the situation quickly and fully .	-4.3788
How soccer ’ s financial rules affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris .	-2.5736
The rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Barcelona , Spain , to Paris Saint Germain , France .	-8.9459
Any consequences will still have to come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA , because the governing organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-5.3544
Financial fair play rules , created by UEFA in 2011 , mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar ’ s transfer was financed without major losses .	-4.6082
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and Neymar will receive a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year .	-3.7082
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France .	-1.8748
PSG can certainly make the money available to sign Neymar and bring him to a galaxy of other stars , given the team ’ s funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar .	-4.8065
Clubs may spend a lot of money buying players , but they must use legitimate revenue sources to help them break even points in their football business .	-6.2139
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007 .	-2.7357
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in pursuit of success effectively cheat and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-4.4396
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.1947
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a tougher business .	-3.8897
During the current three-year FFP assessment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can incur losses of € 30 million .	-3.1812
And , while Platini fell from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , remains committed to deterring excessive spending .	-3.5681
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traversa , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.1915
Although the PSG has paid Neymar 's buy-out clause in a lump sum , it can distribute the amount for the accounts over the duration of its contract .	-5.3564
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer fee of EUR 44.4 million can be recorded in the annual accounts for the next five years .	-3.9466
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the PSG , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , has imposed the most severe sanctions . of , , , , and . , , , , , , , , ,	-7.6435
The PSG was fined € 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and the team members for the 2014 / 15 season were ordered to be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 .	-4.9817
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outlaw their financial supervision by inflating their earnings by companies associated with the owners of a club .	-5.6446
While a Catholic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standard market values , UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income .	-5.2646
This was precisely what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.7140
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made by the World Cup Organizing Committee in Qatar in 2022 .	-3.9166
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and that such a maneuver for UEFA ’ s regulators could be easy to figure out .	-4.1765
Previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.0687
UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.6659
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity , because they were not empowered to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.0823
The latest published reports show that PSG has made a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.9646
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published .	-2.8461
It is expected that Neymars ’ arrival will be a boon to sponsorship deals , merchandising and trikotva gains .	-6.5089
The association assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing .	-4.6264
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go , and it tried to prevent Neymars from moving by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-4.1496
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the president of the La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-3.0280
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is owned by an American sport-tycoon , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .	-8.2882
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.5760
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.2578
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-3.7621

Now sweet cooperation is about to end : the airline redesigns the order .	-5.6337
Swiss-Spotherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a report of the newspaper " Northwestern Switzerland " on Friday at the request of the news agency sda .	-4.4826
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.9965
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-3.4210
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the spokeswoman .	-2.5482
Some 17 million small red white shoggit trays of 14 grams are distributed annually by the cabin crew before landing to passengers .	-7.3162
The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs .	-4.6913
Industry insiders estimate the order volume in accordance with " Northwest Switzerland " to between 1.5 and 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual sales of approximately one billion francs .	-5.6712
But more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious contract .	-5.6089
The Swiss do not want to reveal how many applicants are present for the new tender .	-5.1566
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-2.7691
According to the newspaper ’ s report , Chocolat Frey will seek to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .	-3.0615
For the sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-5.5518
Since 2006 , Swiss Chocolate Tables have been distributed on board their flights .	-2.8982
Before the Swiss entered into a contract with the subsidiary of Migros , Barry Callebaut , in collaboration with Hug , delivered the chocolate tablets .	-3.9924
The possibility to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of the cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.6221

Nostalgia enters the niche in " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " .	-1.9487
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 's , for the 90 's Grunge era ( when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd , went to bigger things .	-5.8576
As a cultural artefact , it is also a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook era of permanent memories .	-2.4638
But as a franchise , it feels like time is running out .	-1.5167
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a talkative can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.4767
By focusing on the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless made it impossible to win back the last part of the joke .	-6.0524
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotional and his parody goes more scatter around , including a riff on the stalker movies of the 90 's like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " .	-6.1482
At one point , a character grooms through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates , and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.4327
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.1006
The endearing Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now a novelist , Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) has still not forgotten .	-3.1763
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.1504
And there is another ignominious plot involving Ronald Reagan ( including Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-4.3822
As always , the excursion is the best part of the franchise .	-1.5461
It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's underbeard of " Singles " , whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-5.2174
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until he achieves what I assume as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twelve Years Later " , whose final scene will show the band how to attend the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-5.0728
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War by " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East-facing West wrestling iconography .	-4.3709
The comedy made by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , directed by Rhys Thomas , claims to be a TV series found : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism .	-4.8102
The main roles are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt .	-4.1861
It is an ingenious idea .	-1.3347
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.2917
There are some nice gags to watch ( the police spend time watching TV chess , as Americans may do with football ) .	-3.2964
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game of ' Find the voice ' .	-2.9248
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .	-3.7406
In six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-4.2783
" Comrade Detective " , edited to a lesser length , could better deliver its Agitprop style , because Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers .	-6.7139
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for a celebration .	-4.2493

15 accused people between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them .	-4.3797
In addition , officials ensured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine , firearms and several hundred thousand euros .	-3.4538
At the same time , two people were arrested in Italy .	-6.3814
German arrest warrants were issued against the two Italian suspects .	-2.4409
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany .	-3.0863
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.1648
In total , more than 300 police officers were deployed .	-3.3622
Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime , violent acts , attempted murder , robbery and blackmail .	-3.7021
Since the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor ’ s office in Konstanz has been investigating organised drug trafficking in the southern German region .	-4.3511
There was a lively exchange between the prosecuting authorities in Konstanz and Palermo , and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-3.9755
For this reason , the large deployment on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .	-5.8684
The investigation was aimed mainly at Italian nationals closely related to the Italian mafia .	-5.7334
Also , an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , in which several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go into the hands of the gang .	-4.9902
Encouraging large gaps in the foreigner register	-4.7640
" Data from citizens who should not appear there " : According to a report , the foreigner register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-5.1735
This leads to sometimes serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-3.1583
According to a media report , the Federal Government 's refugee management officer , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners .	-4.8883
In the case of asylum procedures and deportations , deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to ' sometimes serious mistakes ' , warned Weise in an analysis which is available to the ' Süddeutsche Zeitung ' .	-5.9942
According to the data , the register covers ten million people of foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.4383
The data are therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.5522
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , some parts of the data quality has not been good .	-4.9014
In individual cases , data from 1921 were found , " by people who have long since ceased to be alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register " .	-4.8640
" Incorrect data input can significantly slow return processes , " the report goes on .	-4.5806
The statistics on people who are liable to leave also cover EU citizens who do not need to leave .	-5.0366
Such false attributions , however , ' led to a distorted debate on the treatment of those who are liable to leave ' , says the analysis .	-7.4020
Meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy when they have arrived from there .	-4.7085
This results from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reported by the " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-4.0923
According to the paper , the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures " with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - in Italy since 1 June 2017 " .	-6.3554
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014 , according to the newspaper , referring to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.7443
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees are the responsibility of the EU state that they first reach .	-3.1345
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that country can send him back to the country of entry .	-3.3267
As a justification , the office now writes : ' In the meantime , the absorption capacity of families with children under the age of a minor has increased considerably in Italy ' .	-7.1015
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.4261
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) regards these commitments as sufficient .	-2.1702
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement .	-2.8002
Ulla Jelpke , the left-wing spokeswoman in the Bundestag on domestic policy , criticised this decision : ' Families with children face the threat of inhumane reception conditions and a threat to the welfare of children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system ' .	-6.6675
Second Best Score	-2.0857
A total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Oberreichenbach has already been provided by the blood donation service for other people .	-3.2341
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-3.1645
First of all Jürgen Greule , who with his 100 donations now shared 50 liters of blood .	-4.6086
Traditionally , the community at the council meeting honors the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-4.6379
" It is brilliant how our body is designed and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood to strangers , altruistic , " said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-7.1492
" A single blood donation helps several people " , explained Holger Maisenbacher , head of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the canned foods are broken into their constituents .	-7.2768
In this way , three people could benefit from blood donation .	-4.3354
At the same time Maisenbacher reported about the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach .	-4.0296
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK District Manager .	-4.4365
Obviously , the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher attendance .	-4.9162
Even before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbert were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each .	-4.1090
Half as many as Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexiger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter are ten times per 500 milliliter of their lifeblood .	-4.8112
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.2851
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase .	-3.7929
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " by maintaining interest rates on family incomes in the midst of intensifying pressure .	-3.6151
Policymakers of the Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking to increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-4.1076
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation expected to rise to close to 3 % in the autumn .	-6.3553
But they signaled that interest-rate hikes would become necessary in the next few years to rein in Brexit inflation , and that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.2181
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-3.4671
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - GBP 115 billion .	-5.1760
Just minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the bank said : ' Gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term in the MPC 's central forecast , as the pressure on household real incomes continues to put a strain on consumption . '	-6.0198
At interest rates , she repeated that " some monetary tightening " would be needed to cool inflation and " a little larger " than markets expect .	-4.5650
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.9282
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-2.7320
The Bank ’ s down-adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % projected in May .	-4.1769
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.9940
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after that news .	-2.3617
The pound fell 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-7.1597
The choice is not made after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of an interest-rate hike , and GDP rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the second quarter .	-4.9195
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , though it will recover slightly after the bank by the end of the year .	-3.0481
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage increases , as the tightening will first get worse before it improves .	-7.3543
She added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " income collapse in the next few years , but she added that wages will " recover significantly " by the end of their three-year forecast .	-3.9735
The economy will also be strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending .	-4.2745
The decision comes a year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused sterling to fall .	-3.4577
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to reach prices and the economy fully .	-3.2882
Before the Bank ’ s latest interest-rate judgment , the call for an interest-rate hike had risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-3.9431
Inflation fell last month from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that this was expected and that it would revive in the coming months .	-4.2088
The bank said that the excess in relation to its 2 % target was ' entirely ' due to the weak pound .	-4.0771
Andrew Montlake , Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders clamor for deals and want to end the year in a positive way .	-4.5655
The market looks particularly good for those in which existing deals are phased out and new mortgages are completed , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more popular . "	-10.5943
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people .	-3.2602
Patients will be given access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against funding for the drug in the NHS .	-5.1859
NHS England announced that pre-sex pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 % , will now be delivered by the health service for an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-5.2135
He agreed to finance the trial after the Supreme Court of Appeals confirmed last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it .	-4.7198
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS English chief Simon Stevens as ' important new intervention ' , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a ' decisive moment ' .	-4.9453
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and more clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced across England in April 2018 .	-3.3069
Predisposition prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.8592
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases where there is a risk of infection .	-3.2860
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-5.8735
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-3.2335
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully .	-3.0964
In clinics , appropriate participants who agree with the study are identified , including men , women , transgenders , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.4425
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for participation in their local sex clinic .	-4.2873
The program will be £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .	-3.4891
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-5.5310
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.9594
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity 's greatest health challenges . '	-2.8307
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.3829
PrEP , aimed at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.4131
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner , which will improve many , many lives .	-4.9782
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.8944
Ian Green , chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-4.1844
Now that PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are well on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . "	-3.6252
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delays by the government .	-3.7145
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention , and how to end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-2.9250
This trial brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-3.1293
It is now important for this study to be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and to help bring us a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.7534
Living great life : mezzanine floor and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-3.6945
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , downsized from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-3.0200
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-3.9252
" Before that I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-3.1476
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my prize .	-5.8226
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-1.8678
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . '	-2.4505
Since the first visit , the 1.000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken .	-4.0971
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height .	-4.9929
" I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light .	-1.7873
That was my request ' , she says .	-2.0435
To this end , she commissioned the Duck & Shed architectural and design studio of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.7595
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand .	-4.3440
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task .	-2.4314
" The steel mill is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.6366
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend .	-4.7841
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of putting steel in a way that was the right height for the function above or below . '	-6.4552
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other in full , with a lot of additional drama .	-4.1988
For the mezzanine , a classic retrouvius copper light window looks down over the glamorous living area .	-3.8283
Coupled gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.7563
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .	-2.2329
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer .	-3.7689
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .	-3.2411
At the entrance there is space for all beasts and glasses of Joanne .	-5.5083
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.4281
Folding kitchens are nothing new .	-4.0534
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.3212
" A little engineering art went into this , " explains Erfan of the steel reinforced , veneered MDF door .	-4.4362
'It is counterweight so that when you push the door it glides very easily ' .	-3.9260
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.2755
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued , " says Erfan .	-3.3100
'In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the soil ' .	-3.9521
Here , they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .	-5.5266
" The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-2.8541
" You don 't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.6790
They are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.1947
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something quite amazing by good design and increased square meters of something standard .	-4.8865
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave this .	-2.3436
Brothers Fight for a $ 500 million Real Estate Imperium	-1.7334
Two brothers , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , are in dispute over one of Victorias ’ largest real-estate empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-3.4625
The former director of the Carlton football club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared .	-4.9766
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.8001
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a shop in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-3.7077
There the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-2.9180
It was sold in 1999 for USD 85 million .	-1.2662
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller , as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .	-3.8050
After an agreement with their late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company 's assets and Paul owns about a third .	-5.1033
A court case says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million worth of property and Paul has $ 176 million worth of property .	-3.5153
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.7956
" The allocations proposed by Colin left him with what I thought to be the best objects , " he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015 .	-3.6843
Last Friday , after several failed mediation , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.4198
The brothers are now also fighting to control the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled out .	-5.3034
Colin argues that this is not true , but instead accuses Paul of incompetent management of some possessions .	-4.4625
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-2.7718
" My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.9607
Costs will increase in the case , with hundreds of pages of Affidavits , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-5.2878
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessen from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.3714
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family 's first jeans camps .	-6.5675
Colin says he started Westco when he was " high school in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.7561
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property gracefully to their sons .	-2.8950
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court , " she wrote .	-3.0428
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , while Colin claims that when leaving the company , Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke was paid $ 26 million .	-3.6892
Both Lukas and Mark , Paul says , have become embittered by the conditions of their financial separation .	-4.3606
Colin was very reticent even though he was a former AFL board member and , following a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , the best friend of the TV star .	-4.6605
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.1819
Colin only answered by SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case was before the courts .	-4.1650
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-3.2566
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.8063
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end our current quarrel , " he said , adding that he " still hopes for a solution " .	-4.4652
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.2523
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.4699
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-1.8999
Others have tried and failed .	-1.7086
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it . . . , , and , , , , , , , ,	-4.7479
If so , he will be the first .	-1.1202
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course .	-4.2748
Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.6774
" When John F. Kelly , the new White House Chief of Staff , met senior officials on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to fix : bad information that gets into the president ’ s hands .	-4.0740
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . '	-4.0468
Kelley ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.7361
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.4701
" If candidate Trump was angered by unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from convincing posts , " former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February .	-5.2511
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady price of praise . "	-4.7924
Okay .	-1.3421
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit was ever " under control " is ridiculous .	-4.4468
Perhaps campaign officials know something we don ’ t know for others – that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their intervention .	-6.5836
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.9625
If his staff have managed to keep him out of trouble several times , their efforts have paid off .	-4.3168
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-2.8118
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing parties , people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting material to Trump that might promote their views from the world .	-4.2853
Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about consultants ' preference for providing the president with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-5.0044
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.5223
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press clippings , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is bent on finding out where they come from .	-4.4483
That is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused deputy chief Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a pile of leaks " in the White House .	-4.8134
Though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or that he offered no concrete evidence , or that in the past he made false accusations and revoked them .	-4.2155
Trump read the article and began questioning staff about Walsh . "	-3.0779
Goldmaker added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives . "	-3.1156
How did it work ?	-1.8883
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-1.4194
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers still seek influence .	-2.7857
These immutable factors make Kelley ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.2672
Europol ' s most wanted criminals receive mail .	-4.6501
As the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped .	-4.3176
Police throughout Europe this summer send ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals fleeing .	-2.9739
Since the addresses of the serious criminals in question are not known by nature , information from the population is hoped for and requested .	-6.7929
Europol reported on Friday the action following the ' EU Most Wanted ' advent calendar from winter .	-3.0759
Experience would have shown that many fugitives hide in holiday destinations , as Europol said .	-3.5251
You have put together 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries .	-2.7778
Since 2016 the website www.euhostwanted has been available , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .	-4.6129
36 of the online applications have been arrested so far , at least 11 of them on the basis of indications of publication on the website .	-6.3869
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the Millionaires series .	-3.7746
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again at war with some determined travellers who have negotiated a communal ditch to reclaim a field in front of their mansions .	-4.3524
Travellers parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull , which is called the " Millionaires series " .	-3.7120
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters with them after they were thrown out only in May , but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their incursions . , , and .	-10.6017
The tactical group found a gap in defense equipment , pushing its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-4.0089
Angry residents have harassed the advice of Solihull , who said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-4.1277
An anonymous resident said : " They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones at the passers-by .	-4.1872
The Council must be forced to put it into practice by shame , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-4.8549
Travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back again .	-3.1735
More came yesterday evening , probably even more today . '	-3.3388
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long assignments to protect its parks .	-3.9726
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-2.4115
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said : ' It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-5.0724
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park . '	-3.6019
A spokeswoman of the Solihull Council said : " We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls Police .	-6.0763
In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-2.8108
This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the Court will have to examine when we will present our case . '	-5.1952
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise	-1.7428
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise .	-3.0261
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.6402
This is good news for the city .	-1.1971
After all , with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time and also income from the visitor ’ s tax .	-5.2754
In the autumn of 2014 , with dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the Landratsamt , causing controversial discussions .	-5.8462
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-7.8355
The decision was not uncontroversial at that time in the municipal council .	-3.9260
But above all Freudenstadt 's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious prospective guests at the house .	-6.2836
He should be right .	-1.4933
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-4.8779
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object .	-2.6500
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.5038
They are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.5412
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time now and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovations will be undertaken .	-9.8805
The floors were torn out , ceilings were partly dismantled , old bathtubs were removed from the rooms .	-4.6046
The entire hotel building is a single building site .	-2.4991
There is still much to be done by March .	-2.0191
" It 's actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-3.1297
Everything is to be renewed in Black Forest style .	-2.8404
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed .	-4.0727
All should later become " nice close to the citizen " , as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-5.8978
'We want to add a jewel ' .	-3.0664
Swimming pool , spa area and meeting room are all at your disposal .	-3.7623
Scherer points out that you don 't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but already at a high level of the city centre .	-7.1956
The Waldhotel Luise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wanted to expand widely , explains Scherer .	-5.9097
Both individual holidaymakers , groups and business people should feel at home in the hotel .	-6.0504
He has already had discussions with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause , Scherer says .	-3.9730
The room was clean and comfortable .	-6.2352
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.7755
When asked about the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to commit himself exactly .	-4.5451
He expects less than a million euros .	-4.1699
The exterior systems are also being brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .	-5.9480
A large terrace is created in a courtyard which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-5.0396
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt ist ein gutes Markt " .	-1.4615
Russia Affair : US Special Counsel appoint Grand Jury	-2.9825
In the Russia affair of US President Donald Trump , Special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.8407
The panel has begun work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal , citing people familiar with the matter .	-5.4706
The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations .	-4.5897
The CNN station reported that there are already first subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-4.0769
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-2.4417
Mueller investigates whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-3.0846
The investigation will focus on several men who campaigned as Republican adviser .	-3.6445
Mueller has reportedly been scrutinizing Trump ’ s private and business environment more and more .	-3.3697
The " Washington Post " wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Counsel has personally focused on Trump and investigated the charge that the president may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-6.5828
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine available evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether to prosecute .	-5.7636
Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictments .	-2.3920
Most of the time they are involved in major and controversial cases .	-4.9065
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors .	-1.9350
The board can also be called on by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to interrogation under oath .	-4.3489
According to CNN , charges have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump , Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-2.8740
People who participated in the meeting were invited to make a statement , as the report said .	-3.9973
They should also provide documents .	-1.0970
In addition to Trump , Jr. Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and his then campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were present at the talks .	-5.3212
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the installation showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary .	-4.5544
However , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be involved in the end in order to decide on the charge .	-7.5952
Yet setting up the panel is the start of a new phase of investigation , and a new cause for concern to President Trump .	-4.9867
In the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents .	-3.0620
" Russia 's history is a complete invention , " Trump said .	-2.0881
The issue gives democrats a chance to ' feel good because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-3.8461
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , stated in a statement that he did not know about the appointment of a Grand Jury .	-3.9902
But they also usually work in secret , he stressed .	-4.2480
The White House is in favour of any measures that would speed up the work of the Special Investigator in a ' fair ' manner .	-4.9824
James Comey , former FBI chairman , has said three times that the president is not being investigated .	-3.9971
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , as the statement continued .	-4.9534
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey .	-5.1360
Because of this rout , accusations against Trump had been made that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary .	-5.4134
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-2.7512
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.2088
According to US media , the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff .	-4.4118
This triggered speculation about Trump ’ s intention to dismiss Mueller .	-3.2085
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Counsel , such as the Watergate affair of later President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president ’ s insistence .	-8.8315
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-3.3386
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday that would make the Special Investigator less easy to dismiss .	-4.7748
Antarctica : Gigantic Ice Mountain Fueled in Antarctica	-3.3260
In West Antarctica , a gigantic iceberg of just seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved itself from the shelf .	-4.6085
This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-2.5234
The colossus , weighing more than a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers , is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-5.2192
It is one of the largest ice giants recorded by researchers over the past three decades , with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres .	-3.8710
It does not pose a threat to people .	-2.5217
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear according to research .	-3.4289
In total , however , there has been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice cuffs in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSITC ) in a fact-based background .	-5.7955
According to many researchers , this could be linked to global warming .	-2.6014
The now broken colossus was part of the larsen-C shelf .	-4.8938
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.8682
As a result , it grows ever further into the sea and breaks down .	-5.2036
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula .	-3.7065
North of this shelf , the balance of growth and breakage was disturbed a few years ago .	-4.2991
A complete shelf was broken there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-4.0051
There is much to be said for the fact that the larsen-C shelf is also in danger , because the front edge has never been as far withdrawn as it is now .	-6.2225
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and may collapse if a piece breaks down at a key point .	-8.6044
Melting Schelfeis and Eisberg does not raise sea levels , because they swim on the water and crowd ice out as much water as it does after melting .	-5.6127
However , the loss of the shelf means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow out much faster than before .	-4.7441
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-4.7112
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is , according to the AWI data , the fourth largest shelf in the Antarctic with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-5.5134
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-4.8285
It breaks down regularly .	-3.5114
" Although it is natural and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of Swansea University in the UK .	-9.3161
" This is the widest withdrawal from the records , " he also confirmed .	-4.3181
Among scientists , it was controversial whether the larsen-C shelf would now grow again , or whether it would fall back in the long term and possibly collapse , as his colleague Adrian Luckman said , " Our models say that it will be less stable " .	-10.2499
But it will take decades .	-1.5784
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , a great many ice cuffs of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades .	-5.2123
This long stretch of the Antarctic stretches towards South America .	-5.0775
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.3845
Temperature increases have contributed to the decline .	-2.2122
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years , making it one of the fastest growing areas of temperature .	-4.6929
CDU Wants Personnel Tariff	-2.5558
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions , the CDU is calling for the resignation of the employers ’ association in order to become more attractive .	-5.4173
Shortly before the summer break Kreistag waved 41 new posts in the administration .	-4.0072
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.2155
Now again 17 apprentices have their first working day behind them .	-3.9818
The training places at the circle are obviously very popular .	-4.9416
Some 620 applications were registered for the places to be vacated this year .	-4.9084
However , the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .	-4.0082
Currently , there are still 50 unfilled positions in the Mettmann district .	-3.7872
We are looking for doctors , engineers and general administration staff .	-5.2792
The CDU wishes to take the initiative in the district day together with the FDP and the UWG to counter the shortage of skilled labour in the administration .	-5.6208
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to " develop a concept for personnel recruitment and human resources development " .	-5.7512
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers , but also to counter the shortage of candidates with a view to the future , it is said .	-5.9853
The overall concept should orient itself internally and externally , highlight concrete measures for newcomers to the region and include a training offensive , demand the CDU , the FDP and the UWG . of , , , and . of the , and of , , and .	-8.6396
That sounds like a good approach .	-1.7107
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known in the past . of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.5538
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .	-2.6453
We are talking about genuine ' competition between public employers ' .	-3.1560
In addition , there is a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-7.5350
It is time to act , so that more jobs are not left unfilled .	-5.1545
But Klaus-Dieter Volken , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.4345
He recently caused a faint-hearted surprise in the district day , when he publicly questioned staff costs ceiling and stunned the other parties .	-6.9685
Peoples want to see a review of all the options that allow them to leave the local employers ' association .	-6.0844
" If we do not reach a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the local towns - should aim for a pet tariff , " says the people .	-7.2759
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service collective bargaining system actually provides .	-6.2520
Wages are currently strictly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level that is geared to professional years .	-6.1121
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown more and more in recent years .	-2.9537
Only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on the protection of prostitutes .	-4.3924
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , the Thomas Hendele district council and Martin Richter district director have a problem : they have too few staff .	-4.2823
Italy Tighters the Tone of NGO Migrants ’ s	-6.7025
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they comply with new rules governing their operations .	-4.1242
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-3.2889
Minniti 's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation ' Youth Save ' because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.6726
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian Public Prosecutor , Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.5780
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-8.6173
'We cannot judge any accusations that are being made until we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-4.9919
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of ' Youth Save ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-9.0682
It is believed that his crew will be carrying inflatable boat migrants , delivered directly from human traffickers , and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again .	-6.4505
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosecutor ’ s file , the content of which was published by the Italian media .	-9.4190
The occupation is suspected of defying the authority of the Italian coastguard , which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason .	-4.4942
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must first and foremost have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities .	-3.6769
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-3.0787
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring ' substantial changes or obstacles ' to their bailouts .	-4.0616
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Laureate Organization Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.3049
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the bailouts has fallen sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.5797
'In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , ' said the Minister .	-2.8439
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-2.5907
Increases and Trials	-2.4989
Nine female bikers , the " Berlin outpost " and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-4.1566
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose . , , , , and . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.5112
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.7745
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.6676
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidiesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-4.1036
It was followed by viewing points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains .	-6.4564
In between , there were several longer climbs , for which long trials rewarded .	-4.5924
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurzmarkt .	-3.9841
Another lookout point was raised at vantage points , connected by " floating " trials and moderate climbs .	-6.5890
On the last two days many vertical meters were announced .	-4.3084
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and resting huts brought welcome breaks .	-2.8721
In Bad Dürkheim , bikers breathed healing Sole in the open-air inhalatorium .	-4.7795
New town has also been promoted .	-3.3464
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had come to know the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural .	-4.5307
Fits for E-Sport Console instead of lawn Bundesliga	-5.0103
In the future , are sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles instead of battling through the wind and the weather ?	-7.3566
Fact is : E-Sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages included .	-4.1086
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs to become increasingly involved in this area .	-4.5141
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015 , later FC Schalke 04 followed and finally VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .	-5.3558
" We hope to inspire completely new target groups to the VfB , " says Management Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-4.3890
He is sure " that there are still a lot of clubs on this train " .	-5.9743
This weekend FIFA World Cup in London will host the first " Interactive Club World Cup " where gamers from different clubs will compete .	-5.5117
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified .	-3.2824
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports .	-2.0851
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.4924
" The real football has to deal with the 14-30 year olds in particular , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-5.5307
And : the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian ones .	-3.3792
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , one could be present on these markets much more online than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year .	-5.3068
What exactly is this about ?	-1.8683
In e-sports , computer games such as " League of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterfight " or even the football simulation at FIFA level are played .	-6.0831
As in normal sports , leagues have long established themselves in which the pros compete against each other .	-4.1866
And in Asia games 2022 , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-3.5862
But is it a real sport at all ?	-2.8106
For many , the idea certainly needs getting used to .	-5.6413
Ingo Froevil , too , has been grappling with the question for a long time . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.0450
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.3346
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and a rapid response capability .	-5.0304
Professional gamers should not only train their bodies at the console , but also take care of their nutrition .	-4.4157
'The fittest player is a good player ' .	-1.6280
But there is also some cheer about problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-6.0193
Controls are difficult to implement in online games , and the scene lacks the structures of classical sport .	-4.9950
On the positive side , the scientist emphasises the high integrative impact of e-sport .	-4.6582
Players travel internationally , which is like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.4372
A study by the consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth in e-sport .	-7.4102
In 2016 , it was € 50 million implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship , and large tournaments .	-4.6502
In three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .	-7.5713
This is little against the nearly EUR 2.4 billion of the Bundesliga .	-4.8272
However , e-sport is " not far away from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , writes Deloitte consultants .	-4.3447
Internationally , many countries have moved on .	-3.2546
Major markets are Asia and the USA , where former basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.9507
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting company Unikor .	-4.3922
There is also something happening in Europe .	-3.3004
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a subject of instruction , says Froangry .	-5.3132
According to Dutt , football clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-3.4397
VfB ’ s VfB Board of Directors , Röttgermann , explains : “ Germany lags behind compared to Europe .	-7.9056
It is no longer enough just to indulge in nostalgia and redouble the old times .	-5.2826
It is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time orienting the company to the modern market .	-4.1443
" We live in a digitized world , " says Dutt .	-2.2131
'In this regard , it is impossible to maintain that only in the case of football will everything remain as it always was ' .	-7.2271
Toxic Eggs - The egg Alternatives to Cooking and Baking	-2.8591
Almost all federal states are now affected by the toxic eggs scandal .	-3.1745
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted by taking all eggs out of sale throughout Germany .	-3.5033
Only eggs which are demonstrably not containing fipronil should be taken into the shelves .	-4.5583
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts pushing Conrad Roy to commit suicide .	-2.5634
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .	-2.9063
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months condemning them behind bars and five years suspended .	-2.7513
Carter was convicted in June of careless killing by Conrad Roy , who died on July 13 , 2014 .	-2.2498
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is unbearable .	-3.4703
My son was my best friend . '	-0.9335
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .	-2.0611
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness .	-2.8955
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse , Carter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and eyes looking down when she was convicted .	-5.0898
" Their actions killed Conrad Roy , " said the attorney .	-5.6411
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-2.0927
She did not take responsibility , ' she said .	-2.6302
'She has not shown remorse ' .	-2.0128
But Carter 's lawyer said it was a ' terrible circumstance that she deeply regrets ' .	-4.3500
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he had not found out that her " age , maturity , or even mental illness had a significant impact on her actions . "	-4.3945
A prosecutor read a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy , who said that " there is no day when I mourn the loss of my beloved son .	-4.0715
I want him to be proud of me and like me around with everything , I try to be there for his sisters , despite all the pain that we will carry with us for eternity , " it says .	-6.7799
Royal ’ s sister , Camdyn Roy , said she was " persecuted " by the realization that she would never attend her brother ’ s wedding or be an aunt for her children .	-4.4135
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-3.8158
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.5263
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-1.9453
The case attracted national attention after Carter revealed text messages that it encouraged him to end his life .	-3.6495
" Hang up , jumping from a building , arise yourself , I do not know there are many paths , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.4150
In the moments before his suicide , she wrote : ' You have to do it , Conrad ' and ' All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-3.6429
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she benefit from the case through some press .	-3.6053
The case shared legal opinion .	-2.3147
Among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Knox was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British co-inhabitant in Italy before being acquitted two years ago .	-3.5809
Ms Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-2.9498
Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the new Mini Lahm of FC Bayern .	-4.2663
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up as captain of the Audi Cup is no coincidence .	-4.1172
The FC Bayern is confident of a big season for the Confided Cup winner - there is no extra motivation to do so .	-8.4037
Something was different on his seat in the cabin , which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately , even though the extra garment was very , very small .	-4.6845
But as Philipp Lahm and Manuel Neuer were not to be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , he stopped at his arm .	-5.8394
" The coach did not announce it , " the Confed-Cup winner told after his first assignment as a Bavarian captain .	-6.5654
Good , the stand could have been better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-4.2932
But the Coach 's sign could also interpret Kimmich as such .	-5.4215
It was not Arturo Vidal , who was eight years old , who was chosen as a leader in the C-Elf , which was made up of youth players , debuts and recently vacationed professionals .	-13.2432
Sugar is most likely to be distributed to those whom you trust a lot , who you want to keep on a whim .	-6.8564
So anyone who has been chosen to take up Lahm ’ s legacy can only use a little extra motivation .	-4.9889
Kimme confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : to take responsibility " .	-3.6419
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flipped over the field as a mini-Lahm .	-5.1499
To the right back , this is now his position , the white tie on the arm did the rest .	-4.6651
And Kimmich worked in this starting formation like the one who can best take the helm .	-7.1068
He gave instructions to try to direct the unplayed force .	-3.5982
He looked for the whole thing while many others were concerned with himself .	-4.6719
He also played the title role in the first season of the season , and in the second season of the season , he played the lead role in the first season of the season . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-20.0805
That , after all , worked very .	-3.8210
Süle ran up next to Kimme , Rudy before the defense , both were sovereign .	-3.4584
In the early 1990s , he was promoted to the rank of captain .	-9.6313
His colleague , Mr Rudy , admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped it would be ' .	-3.5539
But he , too , performed well on the debut .	-4.0207
Relocation , Tempowechsel : " I was brought for this style " .	-5.0984
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new entrants was then seen .	-6.3834
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs , but certainly six or seven .	-2.4160
Kimmich said goodbye after a few short statements in the back of his new players .	-6.4812
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle : " What is missing here , I have already noticed .	-9.9340
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game " .	-3.4599
After all , he no longer needs to teach the new .	-2.4407
Alaba Motivated ÖFB Ladies	-3.1584
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies .	-2.0974
Austria ’ s most famous footballer reported on Twitter just before the match and wished the ÖFB ladies well .	-5.3096
After all , the Bayern Legionaire is almost club collection by Austrian captain Schnaderbeck and is working with our ladies .	-6.7174
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champion League winner should be a special motivational sprint .	-3.4683
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern Dusel .	-4.8926
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissing 's Tempo	-4.2873
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.2492
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Economics Minister Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-3.3125
On T V request , regional chambers and companies speak of a change in economic policy - and at the same time rebuke the old minister .	-5.9798
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy , which Lemke has all blocked " .	-4.6361
Natus sees the greatest U-turn in infrastructure policy : the closing of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities .	-8.1241
This year , the Ministry hopes for a plan determination procedure , with the construction law in place by 2021 .	-7.3769
The western boundary of Trier , which is the primary requirement of the Federal Road Map , also plays a role in the country ’ s plans .	-6.2944
The goal is to get the line up and running in December 2020 , says Ministerium Speaker Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.8629
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but international competing companies .	-3.6709
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( IHK ) of Trier aims , as suggested by Wissing , to create a Rheinland-Pfalz label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been dropping for ten years .	-6.0065
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , praises the IHK .	-4.8864
The Trier Chamber of Trade sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.5213
A prize of 1000 euros is planned for the completed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master training .	-6.4763
But the country ’ s household tax list remains long .	-4.1043
In the planned road construction , facts can be created quickly and at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , Chief Executive Officer of the Trier Chamber of Commerce .	-6.7087
Of 56 new engineers who want to employ mobility at the national plant , only 29 positions have been filled .	-5.9562
The IHK demands that more orders be awarded to external offices .	-4.1308
Christian Baldauf , a member of the CDU Group , points out that the Court of Auditors has calculated that the country will invest more than EUR 20 million less in maintaining roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed .	-5.7728
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it intends to remedy the shortage of skilled labour in the region .	-4.5802
It is also sobering to see the country ’ s broadband expansion .	-6.8771
In 2016 , regional companies had only rated net supply as 3.4 in an IHK survey .	-4.4467
They complained about faltering Internet connections and abortions .	-2.8139
By contrast , former Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of Pro Wind .	-4.9651
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where , after four months of disagreements , she has already returned .	-6.1772
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - Car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-4.4165
One day before Audi announced that it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.9848
The chairman of the BMW Group said that the company believed that there were ' smarter options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based , banning or restricting diesel vehicles .	-5.0907
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.9112
None of the companies described the companies as a recall .	-3.0981
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with the rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-3.4398
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.2550
The cost to car manufacturers of installing systems to neutralize exhaust gas emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.4214
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with cuddling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.1694
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which is using so-called towing devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but which are returning under normal driving conditions .	-6.4043
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been indicted , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.7479
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested for Audi 's engine development in Germany .	-3.5904
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-2.7600
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was extended .	-3.8336
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profits of Volkswagen .	-4.1848
This message has the Floss on Saturday ’ s Isar	-3.8724
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.8060
In order for Isar visitors to take part , a raft rides through Munich tomorrow Saturday with a special message .	-5.9999
If you go back to the Isar on Saturday , you will see a large raft between Flauser and Reichenbach Bridge .	-5.5457
And this is not a common raft , with Isar tourists .	-4.5288
But the construction department wants to clarify .	-3.9384
On the raft you can see a large information transparent .	-3.4743
It shows a mountain of rubbish .	-1.6675
The start of a public campaign to appeal to Isar ’ s visitors .	-3.7976
With the motto " True love is ... " the aim is to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river .	-5.3417
As early as last summer , the raft passed through the Isar , and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-7.6886
Mordillo ’ s Knolls and Laughter Against Pain	-3.7027
Mordillo was one of the most widely published cartoon artists , and the bud noses of his characters are his trademark .	-6.3728
Even with 85 , the Argentinean still draws and works on a film .	-4.0520
His message : laughter , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-3.1762
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 in Buenos Aires .	-2.1485
In his first years as an artist , he was among others a draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him . , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.3320
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost in my job , " he once said .	-2.4476
After graduating from Lima , New York , and Paris in the late 1960s , he made a breakthrough with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-5.1310
Even in China Mordillo found many fans .	-1.8865
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities .	-3.2048
Large , round Mordillo figures appear in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .	-3.6302
In the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting on the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-5.5859
His drolly figures continue to be widely spread worldwide through calendars , puzzles , books for young , t-shirts , toys , and .	-5.9145
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .	-3.9077
The main character in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillo 's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousandth footsman as an opponent .	-4.6385
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is scheduled to appear on the screen in 2019 .	-5.2609
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it 's strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.6565
He is not writing the script .	-1.9696
He is also the only actor to have appeared in the Star Trek : Deep Space Nine episode " The Next Generation " .	-10.1665
Provence ’ s Lavender Threat to Climate Change	-2.0255
It has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.0894
Lavender is falling due to drought conditions and disease-carrying insects , which is a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-4.3589
Eric Chaisse , expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-5.4713
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender .	-2.5967
There is also a small cincade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . . , , , , and . , , , , , ,	-7.3990
The stakes are high .	-1.5577
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics .	-4.6546
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-3.8771
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.4225
The solutions that are being considered include better water distribution and slower soil evaporation , but also plant spraying with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-4.8351
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary this year .	-3.1268

The killing of a journalist underscores Mexico ’ s growing threat	-2.8063
The workers of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime , corrupt officials , and relentless drug wars .	-4.3514
But that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.1074
They have been informed that it is important to change their routines .	-1.7777
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : to bring their children into the office who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009 , or to leave them at home .	-5.1854
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.2647
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , perceptions and stomach feelings are rich .	-3.8197
There are drug smugglers , politicians , business people , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s or cartels ’ payroll , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-4.2736
There is no respite from violence , and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 ; 589 are under federal protection following attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths this year in seven states .	-5.4865
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration of Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-2.8714
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " said Valdez in one of his numerous books on drug violence .	-3.3995
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " hang on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-5.5001
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , paranoia .	-2.2967
Although a special federal law firm was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings .	-4.4524
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ’ murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.4962
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating Sinaloa ’ s violence , even though they are inconsiderable and the terrain is now more treacherous .	-4.8633
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , Ibarra says .	-3.2592
" It 's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.6478
'Until we know why , we distrust everyone . '	-2.5749
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-2.4406
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times , presumably because of the newspaper 's name - translated as " Twelve River " .	-5.4802
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-1.8078
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.8664
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.5661
Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan freely .	-1.8603
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the Valdez issue .	-2.5560
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , with rival factions fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-2.4982
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street , or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .	-6.0387
Forget for a minute that there is a state of ' calm ' when only a cartel has control of the coastal state , with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-9.0157
Nevertheless , and despite Valdez ’ s awareness of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is broken up with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .	-8.4114
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder .	-1.6405
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.4906
This publication may have annoyed the sons , suspected gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-4.4882
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story .	-3.2698
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.1653
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.7058
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 U.S. dollars of investment .	-6.2477
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drugs problem , " Bojorquez said .	-2.4663
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-3.4845
Reporters loved to publish hard-hitting surveys without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with .	-4.5329
Eight years after Riodoce was founded , she received the prestigious Maria-Moors Cabot Award for her coverage in Latin America .	-3.5182
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexico 's drug history wherever it went .	-4.6161
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.4190
" I want to live on , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.8775
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompevian TV .	-3.3004
" You have to take on the job that you as a journalist can do - either that or you play the stupid .	-5.7695
I would not like to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.2984
The Riodoce team missed Valdez , the fun bird that could flood like a dockworker , the friend who was generous with hubris and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-4.6552
They relied on his routine .	-1.5090
He would always wear his hat .	-0.8438
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-3.0753
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his undoing ?	-2.4063
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive .	-3.6797
'You don 't like it when you look at their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways ' to move drugs .	-5.1634
" These things were not allowed , " Bojorquez said .	-1.9359
The result , even in the best of times , is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-6.4747
Trust his own instincts .	-0.8984
If it smells wrong , stay away .	-2.2796
The trouble , the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said , is that ' smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter happened with Javier . '	-3.7361
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as they do in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states , where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.2340
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.1087
In the space where the Riodoce staff met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly not allowed ; days earlier , it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.4450
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-2.6998
They were tasked by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan .	-4.8822
Half jokingly , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the police that the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-5.0137
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountains , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-4.0399
For this week 's issue , Riodoce looked at three main stories .	-3.4929
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.8287
They also had an exposé of government spending that focused on the governor ’ s hometown .	-2.7322
And there was a group that carried out an abduction in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , one block away from the public prosecutor 's office .	-3.2511
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.3960
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which controlled all political levels for almost the entire century .	-4.3559
Recently , several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption .	-7.9074
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the restaurant , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.3547
Just a few months earlier , readers would have seen the Valdez column as the most informed source of the abduction .	-3.3628
Villarreal , 46 , nicknamed " El Flaco " for his slender body stature , said , " We to have known what has happened . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.2061
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken . '	-2.3649
The Valdez office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists , because the staff have become what they themselves would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-5.0886
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist at the public prosecutor 's office .	-3.9990
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.0298
A burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests , that it is his .	-2.3393
Journalists across the country have become louder by writing down " SOS Press " on walkways and buildings in organized protests .	-4.1732
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-4.0844
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth .	-3.2193
Since then , she has asked for the government to divide her up again because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-5.3816
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved , and a uniform society .	-4.0874
In his last book , Narco Journalism , he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs , but also by politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime .	-4.3736
The " Articulo 19 " media watchdog group allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials last year .	-3.7746
" In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up , " said Ramirez .	-2.9958
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.7415
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-1.8805
Your body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-2.9944
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separated head .	-3.1568
Some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslav Breach in March .	-3.3458
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .	-3.4362
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled ' What do you want from us ? '	-3.8168
Some journalists have fled their home countries , or even from the country .	-2.6703
It is a painful decision .	-0.9399
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-3.0339
And sometimes they are hunted , as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after fleeing Veracruz .	-3.7398
For those who are left behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.2330
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking scares him .	-2.2552
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a reporter , " he said .	-1.9684
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was finished , Riodoce 's editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all of their phones suddenly began to hum .	-4.6797
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .	-4.2420
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a series of anti-trust missions in the region .	-5.9038
From the edge of the roadblock they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone .	-5.3718
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.6603
Siren howled up nearby - another shooting in the area .	-4.5529
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who held guard to see if they were prepared .	-3.1875
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-2.8188
Riodoce ’ s employees followed his footsteps under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all of Sinaloa .	-5.6661
'How can you even think of it , ' said Bojorquez , ' when , on the same day as Javier was murdered , the interns asked me to send her to the streets for reporting . '	-6.0628
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies	-2.6646
At first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-5.0299
Now researchers have found that the first findings of a Canadian miner 's incredible rhino have been so well received that experts have described it as the " Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs " .	-4.5243
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of red brown - and they said that she had had something of a " restless past " .	-9.4381
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " called it " the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world " .	-3.4604
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaur , which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.7545
His incredibly well preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-3.5643
According to reports in National Geographic , the adulterated herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-3.3718
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-2.8251
He met something that seemed out of place by the surrounding rocks and decided to look more closely .	-4.3761
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-2.1790
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) of the earth ’ s clumps .	-5.0982
After all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be unveiled .	-2.1599
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-4.2680
'It will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs . '	-3.4520
Researchers have found that , although this herbivore is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank , it is likely to be threatened by roasting dinosaurs .	-4.7293
The dinosaur , heavily armored , used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.1017
This would have made it possible to mix better with his surroundings and escape from his enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-5.1236
The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaur family first made headlines in May and now appears in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-4.1722
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully exposing it .	-3.7088
The astonishing preservation of the example enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-3.9567
They discovered Konterschatting , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-5.2809
The results are surprising , however , despite the fact that the contour is common , since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today .	-8.3608
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs , that evolution encouraged concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.6463
But most of the contemporary animals that use the contershatters - think of deer , cebras , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival .	-6.3291
" Strong predators on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous dinosaur predators must have been , " said Brown .	-3.5699
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red .	-1.8916
Scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence of its life , including its canned intestinal content , to find out what it ate as its last meal .	-4.5980
They believe that when the dinosaur died , it fell into a river and was driven out into the sea , where it sank on the back of the sea bed .	-4.0614
At that time , Alberta was as warm as southern florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-3.6757
" This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with canned scaly skin , but it also remains in three dimensions and preserves the original shape of the animal , " said Brown .	-4.9265
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous times .	-6.3014
You do not need much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you just look a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . '	-5.0604
The chalk time was a time when huge Theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs , crossed the earth .	-4.3499
Although the king of them , Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years to Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors .	-3.0014
These include the Acrocantosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .	-5.2710
The scientists , whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology , believe that Borealopelta was sank in the sea after death and mummified in the mud .	-4.2938
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.7471
According to the museum it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the muzzle to the hip .	-2.7856
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.8909
It contained two 20-inch long spikes stretching from his shoulders .	-3.8787
Researchers believe that the armored herbivore was swamped by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-6.5668
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.4246
The fossilized remains of this particular example are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover bumpy tank panels along the dinosaur .	-3.7155
As Michael Grechko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as ' rare as a profit in the lottery .	-3.0382
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .	-2.1286
Hidden remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates bearing the animal 's skull .	-4.7001
His right forefoot is on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .	-3.8961
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.9096
In the thunderstorm : mass caramboolage on A8 : Many injured .	-7.6716
On Thursday evening , on the A8 , there was a massive accident involving almost 30 vehicles in a mass caramel .	-6.5782
There are many injured people , kilometres of traffic jams and gaffer .	-3.1330
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured during a mass carambolage on the late Thursday afternoon .	-5.0150
According to the police , at about 5 p.m. between the terminals Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) , almost 30 vehicles , probably including trucks , were connected during a thunderstorm .	-6.5972
At first , no information was given about the exact number of injured .	-7.7251
They are light to medium injuries , said a police officer .	-3.9052
A large range of rescue vehicles was present at the accident site .	-3.7811
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .	-3.0157
In the direction of Munich , there was a backlog of about ten kilometres long .	-5.9638
As one AZ-Reporter reports , massive obstacles were also encountered on the other side of the road - through numerous gaffers .	-7.5023
The fire brigade recorded the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who now face severe penalties .	-4.6696
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident took place on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.4132
In the process , a car transporter collided with a passenger car .	-5.5020
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .	-2.5522
Deutsche Bahn : Group is testing ' Comfort Check-in '	-2.2482
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nobody knows how to sit in the train and sleep .	-5.0808
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .	-3.6729
And then : pufff .	-1.1234
The creator comes and awakens one or the passenger from the middle of the workflow .	-8.5994
Checking tickets .	-2.6884
But the time of interruptions is soon over .	-4.0975
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the schaffnerlose ticket control .	-7.3530
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus devalue your ticket .	-4.5850
Currently , a test operation runs on two tracks .	-3.0536
" If the offer comes up , we will expand it .	-4.3473
It will then probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany , " said a railway spokesman .	-4.2336
" Comfort check-in " is the name of the ticket devaluation without conductor .	-4.3196
In order to use them , however , a number of requirements have to be met : You need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.7014
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do .	-3.9066
You also have to buy it from the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way to book your ticket .	-6.6271
And last but not least you need a seat reservation .	-5.0847
Because " Comfort check-in " works like this : you get into the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.9303
The test customers will then receive a button for electronic evaluation .	-3.9328
The train attendants will be notified that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked Y seat on their mobile devices .	-4.8802
If the train attendant comes to square Y at the ticket control desk , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an online ticket that has already been devalued .	-6.4617
We can therefore continue to sleep , continue working and remain silent .	-3.6484
Check-in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which is to be used by passengers .	-4.9019
" If you want to travel freely through our train crew without having to check in the DB Navigator yourself .	-5.7886
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time on the train , " says Michael Peterson , DB Fernverkehr Marketing Board .	-4.5543
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-4.2328
Those who often travel by train know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the greatest annoyances .	-5.6033
Because you often do not have all the documents you need to devalue your online-tickets .	-6.5305
Either a credit card or an identity card is missing , or else a document that needs to be presented .	-5.8080
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , which leads to a bad mood in the section or greater area and delays in controlling one ’ s own ticket and ultimately takes time for the conductor to take care of other matters .	-7.1657
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-2.2203
And only for the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stittgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections .	-3.8285
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked .	-2.7939
How an activist got to learn the answer to the question : " Which streets ? "	-3.1027
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-1.7053
Just a day after she arrived in New York City , the St. Louis born sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone .	-4.1907
She stumbled over a post from someone in high school .	-1.8753
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street , " they said .	-3.1352
Realized because no one else had posted the information on their feed , it closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.2841
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweetet on their timeline .	-2.9541
The rapper from the St. Louis area was watching the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo . , live .	-3.9293
He postulated a picture of Brown ’ s lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .	-3.7474
" That 's wild , " Ferrell thought .	-2.9542
But death was nothing new to them and their community .	-2.2211
She dropped her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on Canfield-Drive .	-4.0576
There were photos of the police force and people who shouted , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who wore a sign saying : ' Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! '	-4.1573
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog .	-2.7471
In another video , she said , another policeman secured his rifle and shouted : ' I will kill you ... animals all . '	-3.7297
" This is not usual , " Ferrell recalled her statement .	-3.3183
'This is not the kind of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call typical . '	-3.4454
At that moment I felt chills .	-2.3667
I was angry and crying . '	-1.6749
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.3239
After landing at 11 p.m. , she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father ’ s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-6.8570
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary , " Which Streets ? " , in cinemas since 11 .	-3.8179
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-3.8073
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter wearing a floral dress and a fitting crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had several times before this morning » about the black experience and the black condition « . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.0321
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? " she recalled what she said .	-3.2903
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.0390
I could not take them with me , " Ferrell said later .	-2.2563
" What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past .	-5.5378
It must know and see and be raised in it .	-3.4290
It must be well developed , not only in terms of activism and organisation , but also in terms of the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free , to free ourselves .	-4.7165
Although I have the good fortune to give her an experience where she personally does not experience any blatant racism , she is no different from the next black child .	-8.7787
I have the feeling that I would be doing her a disservice to keep her away from it . ' , , , and , , and . , , , and . .	-7.2724
The first station , when they arrived at Ferguson , was on South Florissant Road , a location opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson .	-5.0572
There , Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch .	-7.6928
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters .	-2.5614
A new kind of activism slowly began to take shape for Ferrell .	-2.8126
" My activism changed completely after August 9 , " she said , noting that as a student at the University of Missouri St . Louis , she was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.4853
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.8901
Everything has come . '	-2.4876
Weeks later , Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan , one of the film ’ s co-directors , during an evening demonstration .	-2.4666
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.2997
Ferrell thought of one question : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-3.7894
This skepticism has been fed by countless cases of people , often whites , in a community that has benefited from their pain and resilience .	-6.6466
As Folayan said in a recent interview , ' We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-4.0690
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates .	-3.5725
His dedication brought Ferrell closer to the project , and together with six other locals followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years following Brown 's shooting .	-5.4694
" This documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks for us , " said Davis .	-3.5268
'That was the main thing for me how these people are presented , because that is how I will be presented ' .	-4.8070
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement is " not a Messias leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - it turned out to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.4974
As a result , documents from " Which Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-3.7782
" I felt like naked , " Ferrell said and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-2.2977
'But I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people . '	-3.8877
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement .	-2.7094
Two of the three founders of the movement who , following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , coined the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-3.1785
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole , " Ferrell said , " and that is why we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-4.4606
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.2696
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.4785
She insists , however , that " this is not an affirmative type of action , " in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-4.1521
" She was the person who stirred up this energy , " she said .	-2.0263
" It is no coincidence , although she was in the front line , because there is so much at stake in a life at these crossings as a black , gay woman .	-4.7461
You can feel their energy through the screen . '	-2.2460
In the meantime , the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist .	-4.0622
Ferrell is suspended for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-2.7598
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A Chaos " .	-2.8107
Nevertheless , she clings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-4.3221
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.0861
It is our duty to win .	-0.8331
We must love and support each other .	-1.2256
We have nothing to lose , except our chains . '	-4.3683
From " dream " to " megalomania " : TV readers discuss Bit Gallery .	-2.8981
The Bit Gallery moves people , although it is far from being built .	-3.3021
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-2.9988
Cold matters hardly make one .	-5.5134
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.7509
While some say to the Bit Gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be real class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , comes from the other side : " Do not need a person " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply " megalomania ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-4.9066
While proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , which also benefits the rest of the shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian precinct will bleed out .	-5.8853
In addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the site where the farmer market hall is located , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-5.9932
The construction work will end there .	-4.1893
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside .	-4.7285
Simone Zimmer : " For many years we have been purchasing almost weekly in the farmer 's market hall .	-5.3922
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women in the countryside .	-4.7753
We also discovered the butchery for us .	-3.0546
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-4.4046
There are also other cities .	-2.9183
The small market hall in Frankfurt in particular is interesting . '	-2.5660
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the rent .	-3.3163
This should not be very low in the new project . '	-4.6678
Eva Kilic : " Why buy palaces in Bitburg ?	-2.1342
Whether clothes , shoes , drugstores or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-3.6478
There is enough of this in our city .	-3.1729
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.7056
However , since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall .	-4.3974
After all , the goods on offer there are fresh products , most of which are offered directly by the producer , and on top of that they are cheap .	-5.6041
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies , because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer .	-6.1033
It is a pity that there are almost no special deals and what remains of them will probably disappear . '	-6.1989
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me .	-3.2505
And the gallery doesn 't fit to Bitburg .	-1.6041
Above all : where should the farmer 's market hall go during the construction period ?	-6.1545
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term if the Bit Gallery actually comes at some point .	-3.8446
Or does the specter Bit Gallery manage to drive all businesses out of Bitburg ? '	-4.0145
George Marquet : " That just won 't work .	-1.8842
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty .	-2.1006
In my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmers ' market rather than this gallery .	-4.1079
However , thanks to the insane number of - in my opinion - pointless construction projects in Bitburg , there is no room for a farming market hall .	-5.8561
If the farmers ' market hall is destroyed , a bit of culture will disappear again . '	-4.2873
A matching similarity : artist Creates Portraits with Chelsea Manning ’ s DNA	-2.6075
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white , black and brown , which almost imperceptibly resemble - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-3.9327
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupmakers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-4.6930
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after exposing classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website .	-5.2358
The new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A matching similarity ) .	-6.1322
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united its expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and Manning , a transwoman and seminal dissident , whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-4.3426
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning , from which 30 portraits were created how someone could look with these genomic data , has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual , commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.2262
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her adolescence , was convicted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six breaches of espionage law , computer fraud , and theft .	-4.3946
Her image was repressed by the prison , so much so that there was only one photo - a grained , black and white Selfie , in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver 's seat and wearing a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated .	-5.9870
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012-project Stranger Visions .	-3.5311
In it , the artist produced portraits of foreigners from forensic artefacts , such as cigarette butts and chewing gum , extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like .	-5.3325
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.5199
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg during a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.5635
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-4.1230
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal postmates who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-4.7346
They even created a comic , " Suppressed Images " , illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's verdict would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person . , , , , , , , , and .	-7.5625
Indeed , Obama ’ s demand for Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just days after the book was published was a welcome coincidence .	-3.8028
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , because Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new , tweet-capable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to address .	-6.0620
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-2.9658
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning , with her oversized signature ( the " i " in her family name has a heart ) called for an end to " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which has been sex , race , sexuality and culture . "	-5.3164
On the opposite wall , their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and Aces , written in pencil .	-3.8214
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist ) how surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-3.7861
" Hopefully , what people will take away from it is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose 2007 video work , Spurious Memories , is also on display .	-6.1910
'DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 . '	-2.7096
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .	-4.1267
She shows Manning how she appears from the disciplinary barracks of the United States , such as King Kong , using a hands-free telephone .	-5.3688
" When they cut off your speech , they won , " they say .	-4.6213
'So never shut up ' .	-3.2843
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greet from Philadelphia .	-3.6203
'I still get gooseflesh when I talk about it ' .	-2.8333
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , by her own genomic simulacras , which gather together like hordes of protesters .	-5.7906
It was also purposeful , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 " 2 , Manning 's stature ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-5.0075
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.5411
'I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement behind its liberation . '	-2.8567
Professor of Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee for killing sought .	-3.2043
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee to be sought suspects after a man had been stashed with fatal injuries in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .	-4.8637
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) issued warrants for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranleau , as evidenced by the files of Cook County County 's District Court .	-4.7299
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several stings .	-4.0034
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-3.6019
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.0577
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead on the spot , and detectives investigate the stitches as murder , while the police actively search for the two suspects , officials said .	-4.0213
Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.3114
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice President of University Relations , said in an email statement that Lathem has now been registered and has been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University .	-8.0399
" This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.0014
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-2.0174
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible ' .	-4.8972
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up .	-2.8754
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Office of Chicago , Anthony Guglielmi , said he urged the suspects to confront the authorities .	-3.7573
" The police have an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them are intensifying , " said Guglielmi .	-2.7741
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-1.7422
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.6096
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.5622
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July .	-2.4582
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-1.9564
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.9446
The management team at Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents : ' The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . '	-4.0597
'We will conclude the WADA road map in the near future ' - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko	-7.6512
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for restoring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) are implemented .	-3.1153
" At a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road map , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.3156
The WADA timetable has been updated in this regard , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.0815
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA compliance roadmap , which describes the criteria for RUSADA reinstatement and was recently published on the organisation 's website .	-4.0980
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could give cause for concern to Russia .	-2.5981
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-2.2386
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.6274
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian Anti-Doping Authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation carried out by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.5630
On the matter , Mutko said : ' We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-3.4574
All measures have been implemented .	-1.4474
But there were no public programmes and we will not admit anything that does not exist . '	-3.3188
Mutko ’ s words coincide with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission .	-3.2365
In conversation with the Russian RSport sales office at the beginning of the day , Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.5065
Nobody wants to accept this report unconditionally , ' added Smirnov .	-2.4717
In November 2015 , following the doping scandal , RUSADA was excluded from WADA from carrying out doping checks in Russia .	-3.1752
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.2416
After visiting the organization 's headquarters in Moscow in July , WADA Director General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is " moving in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-11.3325
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being .	-1.9638
This was shared by the corporate groups .	-4.1914
It is a mere precaution that no health impairment can be assumed , as stated in the communication .	-6.5745
From now on only eggs should be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been negatively tested for fipronile-containing antiseptic agents .	-6.8711
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers .	-3.8601
The Start-Ups that will help your business not become the next Uber	-6.8094
Amy Erret wanted to measure the happiness of your employees on your e-commerce start-up , but the surveys did not work .	-4.6556
Answers have often been vague , unhelpful or , worse still , fraudulent .	-2.4734
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.6090
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Erret , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-3.4573
She has called people from outside for help .	-2.5829
A new race of human resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.1639
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , address special groups and demographic groups , provide anonymity and complaint hotlines to staff , and in some cases allows whistleblowers to bypass C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors directly .	-5.4294
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to follow their health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .	-3.6748
Erratt said that they gained a better insight into what your staff think and feel in the three years with glitt .	-4.4613
In addition to snap-surveys and surveys by certain teams , it offers a heat-card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill them down , why .	-6.0892
Companies come to understand that the top job culture must remain so that they do not become the next Uber to be implicated in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished .	-6.2268
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.6570
The global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to Let 's Talk Payments , the financial technology site .	-5.5560
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the midst of Uber everything discredited .	-4.0614
Convercent has nearly 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.1266
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-1.6601
Like Glint , Convercent Enterprises can send custom " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time , and view the heat maps of your problem areas .	-5.7262
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.8028
And if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the supervisory board .	-2.9053
" The court of public opinion has captured regulators , " said Patrick Quintan , Convercent 's founder and CEO .	-4.0056
When a company is found to be badly treated or unethical , it can experience costly consequences from consumer bargaining , worker turnover , and lawsuits , Quinlan said .	-4.6886
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .	-4.6500
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the headquarters , file a formal complaint , and hope that it was taken seriously .	-4.5837
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff .	-3.4996
Now that the company is using Convercent , problems that have previously been hidden by executives in offices in cities or states – such as discrimination , harassment , or practice – can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-6.4526
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.7455
'And we protect our shareholders against employment disputes ' .	-2.8095
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.3617
But it took the " social media to get their act together " that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online .	-4.6327
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.4143
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-4.3992
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups .	-2.6167
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-2.8848
Glitzers secured $ 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November , bringing total funding to $ 60 million .	-3.1851
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.6324
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they do now .	-4.9828
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-2.0171
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.9185
" If people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices are heard , and that the work you are doing is worth it , then they feel more committed to making it a success , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , who uses both Convercent and Glint .	-5.3382
Investors earn returns when their portfolio companies run well ; companies do well when employees are engaged and engaged .	-6.0198
If third party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and deployment , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-5.1146
The data on employee involvement according to experts of the workplace culture important .	-3.8504
But the data is useless if a company ’ s managers do not take action .	-3.2355
In fact , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is underway .	-3.9947
And if change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and discourage employees .	-4.1573
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on data collection .	-4.5914
" Because if you do not follow employees will ask , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.3507
Are you concerned about this ?	-1.6755
And who do not care about it , why should I ? '	-3.0899
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about glitter , so much emotion .	-5.3145
And , after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-4.5575
At Ruby Tuesday , the company continues to gain new insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to better retention of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-6.8101
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.9445
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.7211
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.3381
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins .	-3.2369
It starts at 23 : 00 when a lot of UCLA team players talk on one side of the team 's new training fields on the campus .	-6.4211
Some of them have pulled out their Trikotobot titles and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-6.3239
For a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .	-5.4878
Players enrolled in summer courses will return to their final exam after three hours of practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6 : 30 the next morning .	-5.3400
" This is a real treadmill for the boys over the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.5155
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .	-3.9575
Therefore , the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the players ' pre-packed schedule .	-6.0374
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras ’ six playing times in Westwood carried out practical exercises .	-6.4646
They are expected to have 18 exercises during the course of August , 20 before the formal start of the game preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September .	-7.1564
Mora said that he supports the NCAA ’ s change of rules , even if they add another point to players ’ busy routes .	-4.5155
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.4184
" And they have simply pushed it through , they continue plastering , they are great people .	-5.2855
I think that as soon as we arrive by Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-4.2928
The UCLA will end its practice once the camp is finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center , a high-class hotel that has already been promoted with footballs that have cleared a protective net behind a gate post .	-8.5311
Bruin players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are vacant during the season .	-6.2637
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.5659
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to record an exercise there .	-4.7696
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is quite a good deal .	-2.8960
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces in parking lot 8 .	-2.0471
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.9188
I am not too worried about this .	-2.9941
We have a plan . '	-0.9329
Facebook wants to intensify fact-finding in the fight against fake news	-5.4489
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party fact-checking , and then display their results below the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday .	-5.9411
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fact-verifiers that may display results of fact-checking from the original article .	-6.0822
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that it has also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-3.1881
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters inundated with false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled postings as they did before the September elections .	-4.6928
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands , and Germany .	-3.4623
" In addition to finding out which stories are being challenged by fact-checking third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news on a blog .	-4.7972
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the " related article " and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages .	-4.2663
Create a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.1882
In his recent past , Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-4.6532
But Scotney has lived 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Beul River Valley in Kent , and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mopharic Yorkshieman with a penchant for historical documents .	-4.6519
" I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says wistfully .	-2.9412
'What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hands ' .	-2.4744
A Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotland .	-4.6764
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : it wrote in 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotional . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.2932
" I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700- years working for the Jacobins , " he says .	-5.1353
" That is his thumb print !	-3.0057
And letters always smell smoke , for at that time one lit a fire because of the light .	-3.3348
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there .	-4.2660
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.3524
For someone who is so struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council in England and lived in a castle for nearly four months ( " To be honest , I have a little overvalued welcome " ) , all this seems to be too good to be true .	-5.9264
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , looking through the archives , and studying the castle 's many treasures and curiosities , such as the mounted hya heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch .	-5.2062
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape gardeners , gardeners and sometimes artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-5.1884
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-1.5281
Scotney 's intimate history is relatively unknown , as the National Trust gained full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.8114
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees just began to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it into the attic " .	-5.0185
Diaries , letters from the English Empire , maps showing who owned what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight for the two families .	-5.1128
Boys , let all go his way ! '	-6.4635
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse more broadly in English history , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381 .	-5.1983
" There is a record of a rebellion that occurred in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.4330
" The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-2.6896
Perhaps the two are interlinked ? '	-2.6753
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle , such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit patron who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the British Reformation .	-4.3373
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which depicts the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.1975
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favourite family of Scotney : " The lords seemed to be pretty crooks , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-5.7196
Other generations of Darrel men resolved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome boys , with a talent to recruit heirs . "	-4.9381
After his deployment at the castle , Rhodes is in search of other unique writing experiences .	-4.1509
He made a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki , the site of an early 20th century sanatorium , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-5.5771
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-2.2661
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.4640
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to deal with the damned life again ' .	-3.2118
Campaign started : Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf is covered up .	-6.0224
On Friday , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Thursday ’ s round ) with the sacking of the 301 year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf .	-6.2974
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.4477
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-4.0142
'Too good for us .	-2.2730
Or ? " , the actors of the campaign have been asking on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel since yesterday .	-5.1699
" We don 't really think this ( of course ! ) , " they write on their website , which was opened yesterday .	-5.4221
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.8346
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem .	-2.3115
In fact , we firmly believe that as a Bad Honnefer citizen we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-7.9560
The action is about more than just a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-4.1305
" It is necessary to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling feature " .	-4.7180
After all , it is in competition with other municipalities .	-2.5559
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a mid-five-digit amount of its new roof brand and campaign .	-5.4516
Military Reform in Turkey - Erdoğan ’ s Fear of the Army	-2.4146
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and promotion in the officer corps .	-4.8929
This week too .	-2.2334
At first sight a normal procedure .	-2.6406
But nothing is routine in Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.5652
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as it used to be , but in the prime minister 's office .	-4.1700
The five Vice-Premier and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs have now taken part in the discussions under the presidency of the Heads of Government .	-5.2992
Thus the civilians in the YAS were in the majority .	-3.7304
The government is taking the reins in the military .	-2.3017
Hulusi Akar Chief of Staff remains in office , but the commanders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy have been deposed .	-4.4744
Since the failed coup , Erdoğan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-1.3287
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army ’ s ranks , mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen , whom Erdogan sees as driving the coup attempt .	-4.7248
The 486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been negotiating in Ankara since this week .	-4.3614
The day after the coup , Erdogan called the coup a " godsend , " giving him the opportunity to " clean up the armed forces completely . "	-5.4752
But has Erdogan really got the army under control ?	-1.9965
At the end of February , the newspaper Hürriyet published an article entitled " Unease in Military Headquarters " .	-3.0770
In the General Staff there are concerns about the increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which manifests itself , among other things , in the lifting of the ban on the headscarf for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-4.9295
In any case , the army and the security forces are going on with big mail .	-6.7211
In mid-July , Erdogan ordered another 7395 civil servants to fire , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-2.8525
Yet Erdoğan seemed to have tamed the military .	-2.7765
The generals used to be considered the actual masters of the country .	-3.0150
Three times , they took charge of their role as guardians of the secular order of government .	-4.4575
After his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reforms .	-6.8261
Former officers say that Erdogan is deliberately pushing ahead with the Islamization of the armed forces .	-2.8454
In the ' Vocal Europe ' magazine , a non-named officer who sought asylum after the attempted coup for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be ' full of extremists and Salafists ' in a few years ' time .	-4.7744
If so , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-3.4963
In any case , after the cleansing , there are doubts about the commitment of the Turkish army .	-3.6183
The management structures and operational capabilities are ' weakened ' , NATO diplomats say .	-3.1413
Washington Change the Green Card Rules	-2.1939
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-1.6602
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas .	-4.5105
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.7485
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .	-8.0872
'This law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which Green Cards are spent on citizens from other countries ' .	-3.9091
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.3403
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-3.9624
The Ministry intends to rehabilitate circuit for Race Shuttle .	-7.5212
Over the past few months , there has been a constant dispute over the future of the race shuttle - now it is about to happen very quickly .	-8.0669
Before the end of the year , construction is to be carried out on the ailing route on which the tourist railway runs .	-7.0144
In order to secure the future of the Race Shuttle in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the track should start this year .	-5.7693
" With the decision to continue to order and rehabilitate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country is committed to this connection , which is especially important for tourism , " said state secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday .	-6.1780
He put the cost of repairing the route at around EUR 2.5 million .	-3.1906
Of this sum , the country takes over 75 % .	-4.0302
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country in the future , will be finally voted on , explained Sühl .	-5.0187
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operator are already agreed on the technical details .	-3.5077
" The road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated with this , " Sühl said .	-4.5623
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .	-3.0523
The race shuttle is to be ordered regularly on December 2017 .	-4.3457
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a railway line between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig , which is especially popular with tourists .	-4.6360
In recent months , a pilot operation has tested whether the track is used by enough people to order it again in the future .	-5.7559
In addition , parts of the track are in a serious state of decay .	-6.8751
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry .	-2.2593
Just when you thought that it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the sex robot sector comes out .	-5.7105
Yes , indeed .	-1.0431
Sex-robots are a big thing at the moment .	-3.0859
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .	-6.3689
According to Noel Sharkey , an emerging professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must start to take her rise seriously .	-2.9083
Customers can choose the robot 's eye color , its shape of the nipple and the type of finger.	-3.7568
'People are making fun of them , but companies are spending a lot of them and we will see them much more often , ' said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-4.7481
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-4.4206
The user can " adapt " his robot according to his / her beliefs , choosing everything from the robot 's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his / her fingernails .	-5.2794
But it becomes even more worrying , because many robots have the " personalities " that would make a Stepford woman look progressive .	-4.2215
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .	-4.7529
For example , the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as shyness .	-4.0053
And then there is the Roxxxxx Gold Sex-Robot , developed by True Companion , with pre-programmed personalities like " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shyness and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-5.1612
" Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well suited to your personality as possible , " says True Companion .	-5.5462
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc .	-2.3964
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people !	-3.2853
She can be tired , fixated on conversation , or she can be " in mood " !	-3.4542
There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics , the allusions to rape when one takes a step toward Frigid ( that is , reluctant ) Farrah , worry one the most .	-5.8695
On his website , True Companion Roxxxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.9142
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxxy ? " says the website .	-3.5273
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys . , and , , and . , , and , and , and . , and , , , and .	-9.4781
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-3.7339
Most men will not , of course , keep any sex robots , and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity , they remain on the fringe of consumer culture for the time being .	-5.7212
However , what leaks from the peripheral areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-6.7178
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market allows them to do so .	-2.6750
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women worldwide are under threat , when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of having sexually attacked women .	-4.8607
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Magd Report ' ) is not the graphic images , the twisted bodies and the dashed eyes , but how realistic this vision is .	-5.1047
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-2.6858
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with porn proportions ) .	-4.2864
Their builders want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-2.7904
But , to put it bluntly , when it comes to their " personalities " , the robots are not real women . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.8013
You cannot separate from your companion or just walk away .	-4.2295
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjugation .	-5.1192
In other words , they are complacent slaves .	-2.0607
Or , to put it in 2017 ’ s parlour , maid service .	-4.9578
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-0.8973
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense .	-3.2355
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families .	-2.7669
Around Christmas and the Harvest Festival , there were newspapers in the US offering advice on how to deal with Trump ’ s horror relatives .	-7.3309
We are all supposed to be demanding to burst our filter bubbles .	-4.9889
Less noted has been Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-1.5272
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with Republicans in our family for a long time , visited me in New York this week .	-3.1721
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.4206
With Trump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades over politics , is suddenly and uniquely on the same side .	-3.9708
With regard to the dining table , that is certainly a good thing , but it strikes me , in another context , that this also entails considerable risks .	-5.3852
Trump has strengthened the left , but his presidency ’ s rendering effect has the strength to push us all to the right .	-4.4476
When we talk about " normalization " and Trump , we are referring to the gruesome possibility that his bibs will one day stop offending us .	-8.2239
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “ normalizes ” right-wing Republicans , who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality relative to his standards .	-5.1034
Today , I find myself infected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s comical version of the madman – the car roof dog , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) – both of which , in fact , seem to be a very mild offense compared to Trump .	-6.1107
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.5217
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the central park carousel , the largest of New York City Park carousels , and the best $ 3 you can spend in the city if you don ’ t need a caffeine .	-4.6257
The horses are huge , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twisting to look over their own shoulders with fear - are extremely dark and the clipping music tells us this in a strange way .	-7.5028
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the Skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.4326
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not entirely over the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is not in fact a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in northern London .	-4.3562
The Central Park Carousel , however , is still a strangely magical experience , since two years old , one 11 year old and two women in the 40 ’ s can go to it and all have a great time .	-6.7609
If I had been able to evaluate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .	-3.9002
On the other hand , this week in a department store I was forced to rate my " experience " of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get through my credit card .	-4.2624
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to match the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .	-4.6166
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .	-4.0628
The poor woman in the department store was excused while I weary the experience of reaching her my five-star credit card .	-4.6565
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain .	-3.3553
Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.4626
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists , which , according to the prison authorities , he suffered after a case in his cell .	-4.1916
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first dead sentence .	-4.1106
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine ’ s Day in 2013 by shooting her several times through a door in his house in Pretoria .	-4.1226
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin .	-3.5272
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius ’ six-year sentence , which they say is too indulgent .	-3.7009
The National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.6750
Pistorius is in danger of raising his sentence to 15 years if prosecutors succeed .	-3.2629
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.9654
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg	-1.6552
As the last of Blumberger schools , the four-time plaintiffs from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and secondary schools .	-5.9028
Three of the school pupils will go to Gymnasium in the future , four to Realschule .	-5.2456
School leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the citizens ' house in Biedental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-5.9639
The 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle to grow up in the chicken farm but to be released .	-5.4521
In addition , the lively crowd introduced a musical entitled " Der Adler im Hennehof auf " .	-6.5026
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it brood from his hens .	-2.8258
Instead of a chicken box , a small eagle came out .	-3.6126
But the hope to make him a chicken crumbled , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and dissipated .	-5.6895
Then the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the incorporation of Yvonne Frank .	-3.2465
The hens danced with the young goggles , the cylinders wore to bet .	-2.7212
Adler stands for integration , said schoolmaster Angelika Sitte .	-2.8932
The young animal is different from the other young animals ( chicks ) , but is one of them .	-4.2991
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.6708
Its purpose is to be free .	-2.1515
She wished every four grader that he felt accepted in his new school .	-4.9813
They were followed by thanks to the colleagues , former schoolmaster Michael Müller , who jumps in time and again in case of school passports , and the parents ' representatives .	-7.1359
The kicking time is over , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.2062
They are very reluctant to release their students after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .	-4.9318
In the end , they were able to rely on the four graders .	-4.9665
In conclusion , all students had a song of summer time and holiday time .	-7.7782
A great deal of joy broke out among the children .	-4.3915
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year .	-3.1779
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.4835
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .	-2.8184
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally camping people , including the two Bulgarians , were arrested in Sithonia by the police .	-3.0303
On the same day , they were released while an investigation is under way .	-2.8538
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released .	-1.7962
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose considerable fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-4.8443
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-4.9933
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-2.7734
Software update for diesel vehicles : What those concerned need to know now .	-3.4723
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.6361
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the campaign ?	-2.9060
The most important questions and answers in an overview .	-2.5128
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.2949
They are intended to improve the emission behaviour of Euro 5 cars and Euro 6 in part .	-4.6215
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-3.0042
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates :	-3.1074
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.5191
No , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .	-1.1068
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have Schummel software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-4.1023
The Federal Office of the Federal Office of the Federal Republic of Germany ( KBA ) ordered their retrofitting .	-6.1080
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.2097
Manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the coming months , but have not yet given a precise date .	-4.4374
Daimler has announced that it will contact any person affected .	-4.9437
If an inspection is already due , that will be done within the scope of the inspection .	-4.7727
How long will the overall changeover take ?	-3.4558
" Hard to say , " says Smetanin .	-2.3361
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure .	-2.8742
'We have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the environment . '	-4.6365
How long should the update take ?	-1.6319
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.5826
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment .	-2.5558
What do car drivers do not drive from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-7.1724
ACE advises against waiting .	-3.2780
According to Smetanin , foreign producers would probably follow suit .	-3.3121
Is a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars now imminent ?	-3.7706
ACE fears this .	-1.8756
However , it is precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten .	-3.6594
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.8823
ACE advises to wait for a sale .	-3.5476
LL Cool J receives the Kennedy Center Award .	-1.9501
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.0293
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to be political .	-2.0615
One of the winners does not want to come - in protest .	-2.1191
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards .	-2.3917
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) , choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) .	-3.4964
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .	-2.1556
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife , Melania , in the ceremony .	-2.9625
Award-winner Lear , who has been known for his progressive TV series , has therefore already announced that he will not take part in the gala .	-6.0588
He said to the New York Times : ' This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the resources - and this is burdening me ' .	-5.9165
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view .	-6.6101
The Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.1674
Former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-1.9479
Making the City Living	-2.0595
Roland Wacker , Haslach 's City Architect , is retiring next year .	-3.2948
The job is already advertised - suitable candidates are scarce .	-4.9886
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years .	-3.1428
And his work still makes him great fun , as he communicates in the press interview .	-6.1263
He reports varied but demanding tasks awaiting his successor .	-4.1612
At the same time , he is surprised that no application so far meets the requirements profile .	-4.0475
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .	-3.7686
In this way - taking into account the regular periods of notice - there should be enough time for a study .	-7.4766
Since Haslach functions as a Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community , the Applicant must present the corresponding degrees .	-7.6371
The city wants to retain this function .	-4.6058
If they were no longer able to fill them in , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation .	-4.3963
But being close to the people is important to the city and to it , says Wacker , who reports of a good working climate and a good mood between the public authorities and the public .	-7.0020
In more than 30 years in office , Wacker has accumulated a number of important projects , which he is proud of .	-6.0142
" We make the city liveable , " he is sure about the building office and his employees .	-4.7179
In the future , however , various projects will remain on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for example , have been initiated .	-5.9694
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , and the stadium reconstruction is still under discussion .	-4.4069
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million , " if we get it right , " Wacker estimates .	-3.7258
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.5109
The work here is fun . '	-1.9803
For a master builder there is a lot of room for design .	-5.6942
With Haslach 's own farm and gardening shop , many things can be reactivated quite flexibly .	-6.2610
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-4.5452
Since the old town is listed as an ensemble , it is important to have " an eye for what fits in " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city builder emphasizes .	-5.5572
In any case , the city builder bears a great responsibility .	-4.1674
He is a builder , " in the end everything runs over my table " .	-4.4319
He can count on many years of staff in support and coordination : Markus Neumaier ( construction ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( civil engineering ) has been present for 15 years .	-6.0837
Wacker also wants his successor to stay long : " We are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the job " .	-4.8780
Continuity is important not only for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city .	-3.2706
If you want Roland Wacker to be buried , the city of Haslach has to provide you with a completed degree in architecture as a graduate engineer or a bachelor ’ s degree in architecture and with good expertise in the fields of construction law and construction planning .	-10.0621
The City Building Office is responsible for civil and civil engineering , building management planning , basic employment , management of urban properties , municipal farm with farm and municipal horticulture , as well as the Lower Building Law Authority including monument protection .	-11.3800
Bikes thrown on lines : South railway closed .	-6.5177
According to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of the Leoben Street ( B116 ) onto the lines .	-5.5770
They were damaged so badly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-3.4257
The investigators are from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-3.4962
Near the scene of the crime , witnesses observed a rose-tinted scooter and bike .	-7.2221
" This goes far beyond an eavesdropping , " said ÖBB-Speaker Christoph Posch to APA .	-5.4128
The perpetrator or the perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and also put rail transport at risk .	-5.0123
In addition to damage to locomotives and equipment , delays and the cost of rail replacement , the perpetrators could also be targeted at rail customers .	-7.1912
In general , a " substantial " sum should be assumed , said the speaker .	-6.2947
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , and rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without disabilities .	-6.6534
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning , two of which concerned long-distance transport .	-4.2708
Freight trains did not stop , but they were late .	-3.5820
According to ÖBB-Speaker Christoph Posch , about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .	-4.3160
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.3340
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD ( inflammatory bowel disease ) .	-2.8641
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.2906
But a new study claims the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease .	-3.4411
The incurable state , which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK , causes stomach cramps and vesicles , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-4.6932
While individuals are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that tryptophan ’ s essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-4.8068
The senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that patrolling immune cells in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .	-4.6499
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .	-2.6451
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , an inflammatory bowel disease may result .	-3.6919
Experiments found that a kind of tolerant immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines .	-5.2772
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-3.1663
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a type of bacteria - lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.4908
The more tryptophan had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells .	-4.1714
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal milieus when the same system also affects humans .	-4.7758
The post-doctorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that fosters tolerance when she found that a group of mice had such cells , but that another group of the same tribe , which was housed separately , did not .	-8.8608
It suspected that the difference had to do with the microbial intestines of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses , and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-3.5874
The mice ’ s dams were sequenced by DNA and six types of bacteria were found in the mice with the immune cells , but were absent from the mice .	-4.4145
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lacked an intestinal microbial and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-6.3500
To understand how the bacteria had an impact on the immune system , researchers let L. reuteri grow in a fluid , and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice .	-5.7506
Immune cells developed into cells that promote tolerance .	-4.2212
Tryptophan Metabolism was a drug that was used to treat arthritis and arthritis in . , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.5640
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice ’ s lining , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.8213
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reutteri in our gastrointestinal tract .	-3.2028
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease .	-4.9850
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.0963
In the presence of L. reuteri , high tryptophan levels can potentially lead to an expansion of this population . '	-4.8459
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-1.8843
In Manchester United , he signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , and Jose Mourinho believes after the midfield player made his debut on Wednesday evening against Sampporia .	-6.0835
Chelsea ’ s £ 40 million signature began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder ’ s role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will .	-5.0522
Matic , however , had been excluded from the Blues Preparatory Asia tour and managed to do just 45 minutes , which admitted Mourinho had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .	-7.1634
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.9865
'We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later ' .	-2.0959
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho shaped his XI start-up for the start of the season .	-5.1311
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a ' fantastic job ' to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .	-4.2208
" To get three out of four , for which I thank the club , " he added .	-2.8001
'I shall be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . '	-3.8368
Boeing " Painted " Dreamliner in the Sky	-2.2273
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-2.5467
The pilot flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and moved over the USA in the form of a Dreamliner , which is several thousand kilometers .	-6.3060
The action took 18 hours and one minute .	-1.6717
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner .	-2.7284
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines . .	-6.1162
Boeing had already done such advertising before .	-2.9856
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing-logo were painted in the sky .	-3.5939
New blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem	-3.3236
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-4.5903
Don ’ t let the party ’ s central stormy fire , just no federal headwinds – that was the campaign ’ s most important wish .	-8.7612
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.7859
Since then , the staff of the Willy-Brandt House have been monitoring events in SPD-governed capitals with growing horror .	-4.8021
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds .	-2.6507
They were big hits .	-3.9225
One by one .	-2.4302
The Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-3.3077
" This shows once again : Rot-Grün simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber at the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.0233
The surprise delegation of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a severe . , , , , , . , , , , ,	-6.8055
Five months before the regional election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-3.5955
Michael Kellner , the Federal Green MEP , has called on the renegade Dutch Green MEP Elke Twetten to return her mandate .	-6.1622
Transferring to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate .	-3.1070
Elke Twetten must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Executive Director and campaign manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.0211
" This must not be true " , one SPD campaigner sighs , when the new message reaches the party center on Friday morning .	-6.3075
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is present after the transition of the Green MEP Elke Twetten to the CDU without a government majority of his own .	-6.1849
It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations .	-4.2902
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.7249
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-3.4112
A blue eye , no more , calmed the comrades at the time .	-3.6611
After the regional elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different .	-2.1770
That became the case - and it all got much worse .	-6.6830
The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to thaw , and the Düsseldorf-Pleite turned the party smoothly .	-5.2213
In the weeks after that , the comrades attacked each other again .	-5.5244
Then , when they had just taken on new courage , came the G20 summit in Hamburg .	-3.8811
And with him came the next blow .	-1.9468
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-3.2769
And because , in crisis communication , he subsequently made pretty much everything that can be done wrong .	-4.6789
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-2.1439
Now Stephan Weil .	-2.2259
The Dutch Prime Minister has for some time been critical of the VW exhaust trade and his role in the supervisory board .	-6.3121
Mise survey values were added .	-4.2474
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Weil has tried to set the tone more and more in the Federal Government in recent weeks .	-6.7620
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not concealed by comrades around Martin Schulz .	-5.0609
They granted him because they promised to stabilize the party from Weil .	-3.8041
Now the opposite could happen .	-2.9967
It is because the Lower Saxony Greens are basically not to blame for the internal political dispute .	-7.0026
And Schulz certainly not .	-1.8307
For now , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-5.7369
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and here above all at the renegade parliamentarian Twesten .	-4.5062
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Mrs Twetten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , leader of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.2954
Mrs Twetten was elected to Parliament not because she was a direct candidate , but because she was elected to the parliament by the Dutch Green Party , according to the Dutch MEP .	-6.9228
The logical consequence would be for it to return its mandate .	-2.4775
Thomas Oppermann , leader of the SPD parliamentary group , laments an " undemocratic maneuver " .	-3.5066
" The will of voters four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Weil prime minister , " says Oppenmann , who leads the Dutch Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) as a leading candidate for the federal election , the RND .	-5.6461
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result , " Oppermann continued .	-4.1995
He asked to shed light on the background .	-2.8674
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony .	-3.6977
Funding for Centre III	-3.5407
Those who want to rehabilitate their house that has come into the years can soon get support from the country .	-6.0981
On Wednesday , Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of the city ’ s urban development informed the city in Empfgen .	-5.1427
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a review of what has happened so far .	-4.5723
Since 1991 , there have been redevelopment areas in the city of Empfingen .	-4.6441
At that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the total funding .	-4.6873
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-3.7627
For Schindler , the existing renovations are a " success project " - after all , it is important to promote internal development as well , and not only to open up new building areas .	-5.4707
On 4 April , the Karlsruhe Government Bureau reported that there would be a rehabilitation area III .	-4.9644
The grant amount was EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest from the municipality of Received .	-4.4563
How will a rehabilitation area be created ?	-3.8588
Schindler goes on to investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-3.8315
It also has a role to play , however , as to whether there is any interest in redeveloping the area planned .	-5.4490
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be shifted again .	-5.3789
On Wednesday evening , the STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-2.6922
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder program " Social City " , in which the renovations would then be carried out .	-4.1898
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of housing and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-4.9414
The measures would be carried out in an objective manner , that is to say per plot .	-4.9892
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute .	-3.4503
Since 1 January 2017 , the grant period runs until 30 April 2026 .	-3.7603
Until September this year , however , the stocktaking would first be carried out , in which those involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill in .	-6.5680
In November or December , if possible , the resolution should be adopted so that remediation can begin next year .	-4.9675
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .	-3.7901
It is a question of assessing urban shortcomings and deciding when to renovate them and to what extent .	-4.8331
There will also be a renovation notice in the land registry for the respective property .	-6.6810
Pietzschmann would himself come back to the reception and get an idea of the situation , she promised .	-5.4882
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .	-4.0618
That is why there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks by post and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .	-5.2813
The yellow questionnaire is the " Arch of buildings and land " , which deals among other things with the construction condition and the redevelopment intentions .	-6.3876
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and apartment sheet " , information can be given about the size , distribution and inhabitants of a living room .	-5.9987
The blue " operating sheet " must be filled out only if business premises are operated in the building .	-4.4920
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time .	-4.1713
In addition , construction work is not eligible .	-3.9900
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies works according to the " greyhound principle " - if you come first , served first .	-4.8998
It is not possible to " reserve " funding for later .	-4.4937
At the end photos of the " zentrale II " project were shown in order to make it " tasty " for the visitors .	-7.3160
British inventors use a microchip to get home and car with a hand movement .	-4.9852
A British inventor is the first in the country to have a microchip so that he can open his door , enter his office , and even start his car with a hand movement .	-4.1634
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq .	-3.8481
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory consultant in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .	-4.8534
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-2.7464
Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .	-4.5043
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .	-4.1030
The White House ’ s Advertising costs the taxpayer Thousands	-3.3786
The decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlighted American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military that was handed over to TIME magazine .	-4.3198
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event at the White House on July 17 with American construction programs .	-4.6482
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and White House senior officials made a tour of products from all 50 states .	-3.1765
The Connecticut helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift truck .	-3.7097
The White House Military Office demanded the helicopter ’ s presence in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the helicopter ’ s operation .	-4.5817
" I just wanted you to be aware of this , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " the commander of HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superiors , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-5.1838
The news showed that the helicopter arrived on South Lawn at around 7 a.m. on July 17 , for the event at 3 p.m. , and stayed until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.6449
The note adds that if departure from the White House is delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the flight flight flight hours limit .	-6.6236
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the unit ’ s security staff remained on the ground during the period .	-4.8180
It was not clear from the TIME records that a second flight crew was ultimately required .	-4.2024
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.2777
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could break the determination .	-3.6073
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-3.9756
" Sounds as if you are closed , " the deputy commander replied .	-4.6593
The ' Made in America ' event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.7421
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.1462
At the event , the President launched the reform of the health reform under way in the Senate , and he propagated the efforts to contain government regulations .	-6.4976
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.6436
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.3209
But to request their use only for a photo-surgery is unusual .	-3.7213
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the backdrop of its first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential plane .	-4.2900
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made in America " - which shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers using American materials , " said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-4.3188
HMX-1 crews often fly training flights in the Washington area and South Lawn to remove the US president at the White House with precise centimeters .	-5.2380
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July , HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House .	-2.8731
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted for the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-6.1083
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-2.2997
The White House said that taxpayers would not bear the burden of any of the other props presented at the event .	-3.5964
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on South Lawn .	-2.6316
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.1250
However , according to the US Department of Defense ’ s hourly rates for the 2017 financial year , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $ 24.380 per flight hour .	-4.8066
The unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico , Virginia .	-4.3165
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate .	-2.5299
" Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.1694
'These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds ' .	-2.9960
According to a 2015 RAND study , the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but consider the costs of fuel , maintenance , and contract signing .	-5.1277
At that time , the former White House press officer , Sean Spicer , defended the helicopter ’ s use for the event .	-3.3847
" The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , " said Spicer .	-4.8289
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , of people depend on it .	-3.4839
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.1199
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise that ' .	-2.9675
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered the South Lawn circuit for the event , but he sat in a fire-fighting car ’ s driving seat .	-4.8452
At the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky officials , and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-2.8867
'I know Sikorsky very well , ' the President said , ' I have three of them . '	-2.4285
TC BW Neuss Before the Cracky Task	-4.0114
Spitzenreiter der Zweiten Tennis Bundesliga antritt beim Table dritten Suchsdorfer SV .	-7.0681
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss starts tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table third Suchsdorfer SV .	-4.0735
In spite of five matches still outstanding balance sheet , the top runner of the second league of tennis has maintained a sense of reality .	-7.7862
In any case , team leader Marius Zay has respect for his .	-3.7923
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .	-2.8790
I find the team very good , especially at the rear . '	-4.3906
The imports from the far north ensure class and stability in the Seezdorfer SV .	-5.0804
" Danes and Finns can even refer to stakes in the Davis-Cup .	-3.3689
And they are also strong in doubles , " says Zay with views of Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-4.0594
" As always , this will be difficult for us .	-2.9627
You also need a good portion of luck . '	-2.5849
The new team for the trip to the far north is practical .	-3.7052
His debut for Blue White could give Maxime Janvier .	-2.1455
If the Frenchman who is still active at the Challenger tournament in Biella , Italy , does not succeed in the Bundesliga match , Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) , who is playing in the Czech Liberec tournament , will be the first player in this season .	-7.5424
The so far unwon Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball .	-12.3799
However , he should be present in Kiel , as should Botic Van de Zandzhmaw , Niels Lootsma ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina .	-5.1440
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster , Máté Valkusz could again join the team .	-4.3924
If it is not enough for the 18-year old Hungarian , who was the number one junior world ranking in January 2016 , someone from Marius Zay ’ s coaching team will fill the team .	-6.6562
How America Can Bad OMV	-2.1693
Truly happy , Donald Trump did not appear when he signed the law on Wednesday evening to tighten sanctions on Russia .	-4.6458
" In its haste to enact the law , " Congress packed some " unconstitutional regulations , " he estimated .	-4.0521
The reaction from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was dreaming of the US move .	-4.6561
After all , the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.4702
Since then , investors from the domestic OMV , which , together with other European companies , co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic pipeline Nord Stream 2 , have been similarly concerned .	-6.0163
The threat is huge .	-2.9638
However , it was too early to estimate the consequences , according to the official statement of the oil company .	-4.0198
In fact , Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life through an executive order .	-4.3153
He has twelve weapons to choose from .	-5.7471
" The press " looked at which the Group could fend off and which could really hurt it .	-4.3604
Narco ’ s Season 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel is brought to the centre of Netflix ’ hit series .	-4.0360
Despite the second season of Narcos , which reveals Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-2.9513
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest bad guys of the show .	-3.9490
With the third season , the DEA has focused its attention on the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world : the Cali cartel .	-3.8148
Led by four powerful godparents , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more government bribes and violent actions .	-2.5020
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.2870
In the new trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña , the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs .	-3.1811
Other new actors include Matias Varela , Michael Steel-David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .	-1.7415
The third season of Narcos will start on September 1 .	-2.4624
Rolle backwards : The city employs 46 kitchen aids .	-4.9967
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself .	-3.8446
With permanent contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .	-3.7709
The clock is turned back in the city ’ s day-care centres .	-5.2013
As of 1 September , the city of Krefeld takes over the food care in the city ’ s day-care facilities ( Kitas ) .	-6.6186
This is good news for Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Assistance , who said : ' We were all very pleased ' .	-5.1403
Cooking is still outside the house : a caterer takes on this task and supplies fresh cooked meat chilled .	-6.2311
The city operates 46 day-care centres in Krefeld , and in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time .	-5.3692
During the last day we had 2800 children sitting at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .	-7.3403
" In the meantime not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week are eating at the kita for lunch , " explains Pommeranz .	-5.6442
'The offer also applies to the 35-hour service if children stay until 2 p.m. ' .	-4.6752
As of 1 September , 46 part-time workers have a kitchen service : they warm the dishes delivered , add salad , raw food and fruit , personalize the meal , dispense the food , wash and clean the kitchen .	-7.5870
" Employees are firmly associated with a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-3.8344
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the size of the hour .	-3.7927
" The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team , " says Pommeranz satisfied .	-7.4649
" So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for kital teaching " .	-5.0009
That is also what it is all about : healthy nutrition and cooking classes .	-4.2308
" The children should help prepare food " .	-2.6216
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.1097
Also for children .	-2.1329
" They have a known force in the kita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people " .	-3.5128
This continuity is important for children .	-1.4698
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - until now also the work of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff .	-5.3674
This variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen service , also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in comparison between self-management and external allocation for the city , according to the press office .	-8.0409
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited .	-3.3422
" But these hours are not so important at all for around 750 people in the education sector , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-5.4531
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN .	-1.7319
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .	-1.9945
Nicholas Haysom , the head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will stand in provincial Council elections , with three women standing for the role of Vice-President , and more than 30 % of newly registered voters being women .	-5.4331
" The role of women cannot be overestimated , " he said in a statement on Wednesday .	-1.4945
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.0852
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.0904
The Taliban have issued threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .	-3.3329
This year , for the first time , the elections will peacefully transfer power from one democratically elected government to another .	-2.2170
Haysom said that a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan ’ s democratic success .	-2.4331
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters registered .	-2.8014

Men are trying to rob 13-year-old girls	-2.3611
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried on Thursday to rob a 13-year-old girl .	-2.9992
According to police information , the men spoke to the 13-year-old , who stayed with friends at the Kolpingstraße , at around 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl ’ s .	-6.4189
The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends .	-2.7846
After that , one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl ’ s cell phone and neck chain , which failed .	-6.5163
Without loot , the duo fled .	-3.0578
The two young men were later arrested by the police .	-2.0536
The investigation is under way .	-1.4211
GMB concerns about investment at the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-7.9412
A trade union wants to check managers of the sponge manufacturer McVitie for the long-term commitment to production at their factory in Glasgow .	-4.3902
GMB Scotland said that the company had been silent about the future of rabble-frontier investment .	-4.3076
More than 500 employees work at the plant , which , among other products , produces Hobbons and Rich Tea biscuits .	-5.3946
McVitie 's owner Pladis said he has invested more than £ 5 million in recent years .	-2.7495
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be " first experienced " if their activities changed .	-2.9838
In a letter to the company 's director , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called for " concern that financing for the modernization of production lines would not be pushed forward " .	-5.9754
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Suite Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members .	-4.9882
Generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-4.4799
Therefore , in the context of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , rising living costs and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie . "	-5.2673
A spokeswoman from Pladis said : " The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-6.3934
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-4.9037
We discussed with our employees that , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-5.8071
She added : " In recent years , we have invested more than £ 5 million in our rabble-rouser location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-4.3231
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site and , if our operations at the site change , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know . '	-5.6938
Did the PSG Barcelona warn against Neymar three years ago ?	-2.2953
La Liga ’ s side may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-2.2744
Paris Saint-Germain will continue to pursue Neymar after making an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its exemption clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record attack ?	-4.7915
The sensational approach fueled the transfer window in the summer , because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for £ 89 million .	-3.5057
After completion Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world .	-3.8092
Barcelona is furious at the way Neymar has forced its way out , although a source close to the Catalan Board of Directors insists that the club has always done its best to take care of it since it arrived from Santos in 2013 .	-5.2757
But , three years ago , was the PSG president warning the world of this prospect ?	-3.6182
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning to any club that wanted to sign one of PSG ’ s best players .	-3.7794
" I 'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.2922
" We respect all clubs .	-0.7922
But if they try to sign one of our players with them , they will have consequences . '	-4.1864
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer .	-3.4396
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its offers to Neymar .	-4.0309
Rollers Overcast and Damaged	-3.3424
During the night from Friday to Saturday an unknown perpetrator has deliberately reversed a scooter parked in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused material damage of over 200 euros to the covering of the vehicle .	-7.2495
The Police Schramberg , phone 07422 / 27 01-0 , asks for information .	-4.1347
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese .	-2.1034
Because a car came up to him on his lane , the driver of a VW Touran had to avoid and touched the control plan .	-8.3099
On Thursday evening the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on the road with his VW at 7.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau towards Leese .	-4.6490
In the vicinity of Stolzenau , a car came to him on his lane , so he had to move to the right .	-7.5804
The tour driver picked up the map .	-6.5999
The car suffered material damage .	-3.7480
The driver of the next car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .	-4.5808
According to the accident victim , it may be good that the Mercedes driver did not notice the accident at all .	-3.9557
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the " polluter pays " vehicle to contact the " Commissioneriat in Stolzenau " on telephone 05761 / 92060 .	-5.8116
Interview : " Domspatzen-Report relieves Papst Brother Georg Ratzinger "	-7.8550
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves papst brother Georg Ratzinger .	-3.5112
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-2.1543
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to generate debate .	-4.7632
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the reform movement " We are Church " , declared after publication to the German Press Agency that he expects an apology from the former Regensburger Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Master Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emergent Pope Benedict XVI .	-5.0513
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or at the time their misjudgement of what was happening .	-5.3722
The Vatican newspaper , on the other hand , criticised the ' Osservatore Romano ' for being ' double standards ' when it comes to reporting violence in the Domspatzen .	-6.8048
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that these are " shameful and shameful acts " that should be punished and prevented in the future ; but that the " degree of media manipulation " , according to author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee , is striking .	-6.0676
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all ills is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-3.9612
In the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk , Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said : " You like to go to the church and this is a pet .	-6.1279
She also pointed out that in her youth ' beatings were a normal pedagogical means ' to deal with naughty children , as I was . '	-5.5291
It would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-1.9744
In connection with the reports of cases of abuse , papst brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-4.7138
author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the commemorative book " My Brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) , is completely wrong .	-5.6542
" I must protect Georg Ratzinger , " he says , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he assesses the results of the final report .	-3.8155
What exactly stands in the 440 page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , appointed by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment ?	-4.7805
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused " with high plausibility " between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " by ass, 67 .	-4.5172
The final report on Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , states : " In summary , it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and mental violence in many cases .	-5.0641
Particularly in the case of high emotionality , punishment could also be more severe for pupils .	-4.5651
Nevertheless , unlike many other defendants , it is striking that many victims value R. 's general humanity and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him in spite of violence " .	-6.8678
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger , in his opinion , relieves the .	-6.2800
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the " incidents of violence exercise to guardians of the Regensburger Domspatzen " gives a contradictory picture of master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger .	-6.3852
On the one hand , many students emphasize his " humanity " .	-3.2199
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist , who often became handsome when a domspatz did not perform musically well .	-7.1449
How do you view this final report as his biographer ?	-2.5129
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble to read the 440 pages of the report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all .	-9.2791
Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.2017
The excesses of violence at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of effect .	-3.3464
At best , he can be accused of learning too late or of not taking his initial suggestions seriously enough .	-5.7570
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-4.8866
The vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , give an excellent testimony , describe him as a " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as an extremely good teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and was " always surrounded by grapes from children " .	-6.5565
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which has already led to the breaking of rage .	-6.6990
He himself admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologized for not only clashing with stools and throwing the keyring on the floor , but also for the fact that he was making ear feeble and too cheeky boys on his hair or ears .	-10.2707
In order to save his honor , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the period in question , the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , among parents as well as among teachers .	-4.9835
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-4.4893
Of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.1182
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-3.7459
This is , of course , trivial compared with what this report is about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of pre-school violence .	-5.8345
One wonders if it is not more a matter of his fame and role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him .	-6.3357
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently with the Bavarian Pope .	-3.2840
The truth , however , is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-3.4228
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the subject of abuse in the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen .	-4.7893
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report ?	-3.8559
Michael Hesemann : Very clearly no .	-3.1736
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted himself to the Master of the Cathedral .	-3.5940
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.7474
" I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it , " said one of the victims on behalf of the others , " I was very embarrassed . "	-4.9910
The real problem with educating about sexual abuse was , and still is , that most victims remain silent out of shame .	-3.4681
If they did not even trust their parents and siblings , it would certainly not be a choir leader who would have been , in a way , a professional colleague of the .	-6.4184
How do the Domspatzen guardians rate Ratzinger 's role with regard to cases of abuse ?	-5.2915
Michael Hesemann : As one inquired student put it : " Regarding sexual abuse ... do I see ... no case in which he of all people ( Georg Ratzinger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator .	-6.5837
I also think it is really absurd to assume that he , of all people , has opened up buoys more intrusive , clearer or even more , than to their parents , boarding school leaders , confidence teachers , etc .	-8.9718
It is unthinkable to talk to him about sex . '	-3.3118
Thus , the report comes to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that pupils and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed during the investigation ' .	-6.7946
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is thus to be acquitted of any complicity .	-4.3485
In this way , he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or of having brought him to trial .	-5.2157
There is therefore no reason to link his good name with these repulsive crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.9971
In the media , much of the " violent excesses " of the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen was reported .	-5.4562
The report accuses the former master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger of " looking the way " .	-4.4257
Does he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.8448
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed and mixed up in the reporting , into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.8713
But that , in turn , is an abuse of the report .	-3.0248
There is a clean separation between the preschool and the high school of the catholics , between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.8232
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir leader of the Cathedral Spatzen .	-5.6865
All the terrible caning pedagogy , the cases in which boys were literally harassed and painted by sadistic teachers and suffered from them appallingly , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed .	-6.2791
But they had nothing to do with the master of the Cathedral , Georg Ratzinger , because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium .	-6.4819
On this , as most witnesses point out , the subject of " pre-school " was taboo .	-6.2354
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even " paradisiacal " conditions .	-7.5068
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-2.7340
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-3.1761
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims value the general humanity of R. and therefore even combine positive memories with him in numerous cases , despite violence ' .	-5.2540
At most , then , there is the accusation of turning a blind eye .	-4.4020
However , despite all the efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported about pre-school conditions .	-4.6506
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just began to establish himself , and from the events at a school in which he did not work and was responsible , ( according to the witness ) he did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .	-6.9847
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently turn his ears before the conditions ?	-4.5264
Michael Hesemann : No , because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.4329
In it , he points out that " caning continues to be practised in preschool " .	-4.6077
Even in view of the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .	-3.6242
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when caning had long since been banned in Bavaria too .	-4.1992
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as we all know .	-3.5486
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded .	-5.9569
Nor can we say that he has always looked the other way .	-3.2444
That is simply not true .	-1.1864
It was not until 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria as well .	-3.2230
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to those days .	-3.3982
How do you see this ?	-1.8343
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " fallacy of anachronism " , the danger of judging past by moral standards today .	-5.4124
The prince is right .	-5.9483
Of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was abominable , nor to what was said about adversity and violence against innocent children 's souls at preschool , which goes far beyond what was then common .	-7.8903
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .	-4.7158
But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.9848
His means of discipline and punishment , that is to say , ear-shafts and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-5.4834
When physical punishment was then banned , he also adhered strictly to it .	-3.9131
What image of his Regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger give in his talks with you for the book " My Brother of the Pope " ?	-4.8057
Did the issue of caning also arise ?	-3.1328
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective that the chapels played only a supporting role .	-6.4087
Nevertheless , I do not deny at all that he had a strict regime there .	-3.8717
But this too must be said once again : without this perfectionism , without demanding unconditional discipline , he would hardly have been able to form an institution of world renown from the until then rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-6.7273
With cookies and candies alone , one does not make recalcitrant boys stand for great singers and for every success in any field , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-6.4750
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the discussions on her book ?	-3.9175
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have seen him again and again as wonderful , humorous , principled , deeply believable and heart-good people , of whom one cannot imagine he could suffer even a fly .	-8.1914
I regularly get to know how many former cathedral sparks still keep in touch with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family , 23 years after his emergence .	-6.7427
Those who still do not forgive him for being strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-4.3981
Today , most of the Cathedral Spats are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them .	-6.0094
And that he was always a good paternal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a likeable person of respect , to whom they are still looking up today and who they actually worship .	-7.7778
I would ask you to make it quite clear once again that all the accusations against him are methods of education that were the order of the day at the time .	-8.7583
We can be pleased that we have long since overcome this time .	-3.8851
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat simply because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother .	-3.2535
The evil intent behind this is all too obvious .	-2.6594
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.2609
Now the decency would command that a 93-year-old man , who has earned a great deal of credit , would finally be at peace without those outside Bavaria , and perhaps still Germany , who would probably not know the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-7.8965
