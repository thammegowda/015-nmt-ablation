Delete Brand in French Chemicals
The fire broke out on Thursday at night and no one was injured in the incident.
The Fire could be stopped.
On Thursday, around 500 metres of buildings were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed, and the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produced additives for lubricants.
The chemical factory already made headlines in the past, for example, when in 2013, gas methanthiol escaped Methanthiol and the surrounding area flew widely to bad eggs, and in 2015, after an industrial accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city ’ s waste water system.

Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without trace.
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shot munitions, including three machine guns, most of which are unclear, and the opposition speaks of a '' scale.
The German Federal Armed Forces are constantly disappearing from weapons and ammunition - many of which have been without trace so far - and since early 2014, the force has been recording the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and almost 20,000 guns, from a conspiracy listing of the Federal Defense Ministry, which the German editorial network reports.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, a gun and 3474 gun munitions have been recovered.
The amount of loss of weapons and ammunition in the German Armed Forces was "frightening", said Martina Renner, a member of the Linken-Bundestag, all the more so because, in the course of investigations, little was found again.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port.
More than two months after his appointment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas this Friday.
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian Government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters initially, and the shipping company said that it wanted to wait for an official certificate from Tehran.
On 19 July, the "Stena Impero" was raised by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Hormuz Sea Road under the charge of violating security rules, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary arrest of an Iranian oil tanker before the British Gibraltar.
The Hormuz road is one of the world ’ s most important maritime routes, linking the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean, and much of the global export of oil is shipped by the straits, and tensions in the region have been in recent months. into the conflict between,,, and,,,,,.
Merkel appreciates people ’ s courage in the Peace Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has acknowledged the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago in the peace revolution; in the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had brought the then GDR regime to a halt, Merkel said at a ceremony by the Thuringian CDU Group on the imminent day of German unity in Erfurt, and the Chancellor reminded us, among other things, of the occupation of the Stasi headquarters.
Musk aspires to extradition records
Tesla ’ s quarter may hold record levels, but despite the extradition boom, there have been recent losses in the electric car company.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk gave a strong boost to his electric car company with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could buy 110000 orders, and Musk ’ s circular letter continued. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the clientele, with Tesla having to provide as many resources as possible to the quarterly.
In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars, reaching its previous peak.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals, with a total of 360000 to 400000 cars delivered in 2019, with six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter, and the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low, and despite the boom, losses.
To solve puzzles: that is why we cannot cheat ourselves.
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from kitting themselves, as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments at rats, as they announced on Thursday evening, and progress has been made on why children are so fiercely opposed to the kite, only to demand more.
After all, it has also been shown why the sewing of a kitting hand solves laughing even before touching, lying on a deep layer in the larch, which already solves the laughter while waiting for the kitten.
According to previous research, rats with "laughter" in the ultrasound area react when they are cooked by humans, and this "lau" is mediated by the part of that serves the processing.
Laughter is suppressed during self-contact.
It has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and contact by others - that is, people cannot cheat themselves, but the researchers of Berlin found out in the experiments at the rats that laughter, as well as the activity of the area in question, is suppressed during a self-touch, even if living creatures clean themselves.
However, if the self touch and the touch of others are suppressed at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed, suggesting that the brain of the rats cannot distinguish between self-touch and touch by others.
In addition, the rats have been trained to cheat themselves, thus sometimes prematurely abandoning this initiation in the experiment, showing escape behaviour or shrinking.
Waste disaster: Remove large-scale fire in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, has been extinguished in the north of France, and the prefecture of the AFP news agency has been suspended on Thursday night.
According to official data, no hazardous substances should be discharged, and the samples taken do not give any cause for concern, as Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning.
Schools and nursery schools have been closed.
Residents were invited not to leave their homes, buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and nurseries remained closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson of his own sister
The premier ’ s sister commented on Boris Johnson ’ s speech in Parliament at the first session after the forced break on Wednesday evening, threatening to bring the country out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement if Brussels does not agree to its demands for changes to the Brexit agreement, but it is unclear how he intends to achieve that.
As the Prime Minister said, 'The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and to restore this country would be to withdraw the EU'. Cox was murdered in 2016 during the referendum campaign by a right-wing extremist.
Mahnmal to the Oslo and Utöya attacks is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial is revealed in Norway on Saturday in honour of the victims.
In the same place the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims.
On 22 July 2011, the legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first ignited a car bomb in the Oslo government district and shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp for the youth organisation of the Socialist Workers' Party following the attacks, killing 77 people.
Iran Free British Tankers
The UN General Debate did not resolve the conflict in Iran, but now there is a problem less, and the British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which is being held in Iran, could be a puzzle in the Iranian President ’ s peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", held in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now travelling to Dubai for medical examinations, explained Reedereichef Erik Hånell.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the establishment of the ship as illegal. 'This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law,' said a communication on Friday.
On 19 July, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards set the tanker under the charge of flouting the provisions of the Persian Gulf Law, and seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September, and the remaining 16 crew members were doing the right thing, as Hånell said, in the face of the difficult and exciting situation in the last ten weeks, working to bring them back together with their families as quickly as possible.
The British Government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar following the establishment of the 'Stena Impero', where a supertanker with oil from Iran, intended for Syria, had been put on the chain at the beginning of July, and the authorities said that they were against EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria and that the British had received the reference to the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of 'piracy' and threatened with consequences; in mid-August, the 'Adrian Darya-1' was finally released, with suspicions that it was a bargaining deal to get to the '' Stena Impero ', London refused.
The road from Hormus is one of the world ’ s most important maritime routes, linking the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean, and much of the world ’ s exports of oil are shipped by the straits; tensions in the region have worsened enormously in recent months, with trade shipping being dragged into conflict between the US and Iran, with several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries, with Americans accusing Iran of building nuclear weapons, and Iran rejecting it; the US unilaterally abandoned the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb, while ending its political and economic isolation; and, since then, the US government has put pressure on the Tehran government to impose a tougher and broader deal on other areas.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of trade vessels in the region.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus, with the initiative 'Coalition of Hope' for the Persian Gulf, Iran, along with the Arab Gulf states, and without foreign protective powers, ensuring the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India, with its protectionist economic policies, is building a better future.
India would be predestined for the "war profiteer"; given America's punitive tariffs imposed on Chinese producers by US President Donald Trump, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reschedule Asian firms that are considering moving their production from China to another country, India is calling itself one of the preferred alternatives in a survey by the UBS, which, however, has nothing to do with the vagaries of the Sino-American trade war.
But now India itself has come under Trump ’ s focus; from the White House ’ s “Kingdom of Tariffs, ” in early June, America removed trade preferences for 2000 products from the emerging market. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and.
On the world map of trade wars, however, the frictions with India are merely a sideshow, and America also views the world ’ s largest democracy through the security spectacle, with Delhi and Washington uniting concerns about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean, with a Salve of American punitive tariffs on India unlikely. India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just assumed a second five-year term, is likely to be safe.
The problem, however, lies elsewhere: the empirical assertion that open markets are accelerating economic development has a grave state in the Socialist Republic of India, even under Modi ’ s reform zeal is aimed mainly at the bureaucratic madness that has stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies are now receiving faster building permits for construction; they benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure; and a more grip insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for bankruptcy to liquidate firms with false debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings, and India ’ s economic optics have won much for the better in the first five modes years, but trade policy does not have that in place to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, even erected new barriers to the National Conservative government.
In the West, Modi of the Nimbus of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country economically, owing not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At the heart, however, the “India First ” Advocate never depends on protectionist economic policies, which prevents Indian firms from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition, thanks to the deportation of their industries, including tribal electors of Modi Bharata and Janata Party.
Supporting Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday

Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships.
In the first run of men over 5,000 meters Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to swing dangerously.
"I just wanted to help him; everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists.
He did so at the end of the evening - and much more intensively than he would have thought - because this heroism will be remembered, and, with Dabo, his competitor, Busby, even allowed him to go ahead and voluntarily took the last place - well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this race, it had nothing to do with it at the end, because the coach, which was only made with much help, was disqualified by the World Equality Association at the end of the day.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying in Lisbon, was present at the World Cup in Doha to set a personal record time, which, according to official data, was 18: 10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes.
Millionenmasch: Egyptians are preparing for a wild day of protest.
In Egypt, security measures have been reinforced in the run-up to possible anti-government protests, with a reinforced police presence in the center of Cairo on Friday, with several underground stations closed, streets closed to central Tahrir Square.
In the past few days, the police had strengthened their street controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians were partially searched for news and photos related to the protests, and hundreds were arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, and Mansura, hundreds of participants were protesting against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ’ s government, which criticized corruption and mismanagement, an open protest against political leaders in Egypt for years.
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) has recorded more than 1,570 arrests by Friday, and the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) have said that more than 2,000 arrests have not been confirmed.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily arrested" only because they were 'at the wrong place' at the wrong time, HRW informed lawyers of detainees.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, so the government is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Mailers should be able to donate returns easier.
For online retailers, many returned packages have been lost, and around 20 million returns have been dumped, but there is an alternative.
The Treasury has shown online traders like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While companies could not be exempted from VAT on contributions, the ministry explained on a matter of the Green German Parliament, about which the newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday, the traders could set the market value of unsold returns so low that they would not have to pay a turnover tax or little.
Researchers at the University of Bamberg found that, when ordering on the Internet, German citizens sent back each sixth package, and around four per cent of the goods - some 20 million products - then landed in the rubbish and, according to the current legal situation, they would cost additional money, because the financial authorities assess contributions such as sales, which would then incur VAT.
Green group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies cannot evaluate products for sale and donate to non-profit organizations free of charge.
Banksy-Kunst to auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting.
The famous work of Streetart star-banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Bank's work emphasizes "the replica of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world in the basic posture of animals and tribes".,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.
The work was first exhibited in the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of Britain, where Banksy lives, and this year the artist had re-exhibited the painting - simultaneously with the original Brexit date on March 29.
The image could change the owner for one million days.
Finally, at the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday, following a forced break by the Supreme Court by Johnson, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard swap with the opposition, and Johnson wants to make the Brexit that had already been postponed twice on October 31, if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes in the Brexit debate; in Dover in the south-east of England, he painted an image that is a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a mosquito, with thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's violent attacks on Brexiteers in Parliament do not, according to his top adviser, contribute to a climate of hatred; compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy was a "walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday when he made a booking. "We will enjoy it, we will be out of the EU and".
Johnson had attacked Brexiteers hard in Parliament in recent days, and accused them, among other things, of "betrayal" on the people, alleging that he could endanger MEPs because they could be targeted at death threats, he did so as a "humbug."
Cummings said that the only way to get calm again is for MEPs to finally respect the British decision to leave the EU, and it is not surprising that people were told that Britain was still not out of the EU three years after the referendum.
On Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint in the light of the uploaded mood. 'We should talk with respect', it was stated in a statement. 'And we should also listen'.
Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister, Khan, is calling for undo intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the United Nations General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday during the Uno General debate in New York. "If that is going badly, one hopes for the best, but is prepared for the worst".
Since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have waged three wars, two of them to separate the divided Kashmir region, and both nuclear powers each have a share of Kashmir, another part of which is China. In early August, India had removed the autonomous status of the Kashmir region, thereby dramatically increasing tensions relative to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is reacting with tough hands to the current protests in Egypt, firing ammunition on the population, and more than 2,000 detainees are joining the 60,000 political prisoners that are already there. Protesting in Egypt has never been safe, but since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario like the times of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects, and the feeling of being stifled by their own government are driving millions into the streets, and that is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how tough it is against adversaries, and the situation has even deterior.
Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is 10%; anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide whom to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola, or the military, because the latter is not only responsible for oppression, but also the largest economic actor; the military builds roads, houses, soccer stadiums, produces food, and much more; it has been.

Tüv checks at the terminal: BER-Chef: No "showstopper" more for the main airport.
Two months have been tested to see if the complex system mesh works together with the BER-Brandschutz system.
After large-scale Tüv inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening in October of next year, which I am sure was said by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Rainer Bretschneider, after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed audit, but also said that there are still flaws in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we do not have a real showstopper".
There are, however, indications that the temporary reserve is no longer likely to be too large, and the construction production display is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables still need to be remedied, and the Tüv will look into them by February. 'In order to create the conditions for the commencement of the operation of the aircraft, intensive work must continue to be done to deal with the shortcomings', a written communication stated.
Lütke Daldrup said that, in many cases, there is a lack of evidence, not so much about new cables, but there is still no exemption for all the nozzles on which the cables hang, and the head of the airport expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the transition to the train station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily, and the problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago, this time involving smoke killers, who are driving down a fire like a canvas, so that the smoke does not spread too far, and 36 engines have to be replaced, so there will be new attempts at hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
The airport's opening in 2011 was expected to be delayed by problems with fire protection and other construction barriers and planning flaws.
Since passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport, which is why they are due to attend a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by Chairman Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers: Finance Director Heike Fölster will change to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Human Resources Manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said.
Chemnitz: Automatic for drugs sprayed - Police arrests man
He needed money for drugs - and was driving a number of machines into the air in the Chemnitz area.
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply, causing millions of damage!
The police took a 33-year-old German after two detonations at the Bu ̈ rgerstraße at the end of May and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the hereditary phenomenon of explosions of explosions of explosions in Tateinheit with particularly heavy case of theft carried out by the Chemnitz crime police, not only did this suspicion against the 33 yes hrigen".
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old chemist now has a total of eight deeds.
The police spokesman: "With the loot, he seems to have funded his fundraising efforts".
The total damage incurred is at least EUR 60 000!
The automatic bomber is now in custody, and the police investigation against him is continuing.
It is possible that he was also responsible for further automatic conditions in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna.
The Lufthansa Group is developing its strategy for Vienna Airport, in the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna ", confirmed on Friday a press spokesman from Austrian Airlines to APA.
The Vienna basis of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus be effectively dissolved, with the currently seven Eurowings aircraft remaining four in Vienna, taking over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings personnel.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, explained by the speaker.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serve as a "Production Company" for the Group's sister AUA, for example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings equipment.
The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced that it would increase its fleet to 16 aircraft in Vienna next summer.
The challenge of Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken AUA in five years, replied on Friday AUA board Andreas Otto: "We remain the number one at the site, in five, six or ten years".

Study of the causes of heart diseases
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, but what does a heart defect or an infarction really trigger?
Through the analysis of the genetic heritage of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, divided by the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday.
It is also the case that there is a significant risk factor in cardiovascular diseases, such as obesity, smoking and unhealthy nutrition, and that the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known.
At the moment, more than 4,000 of the roughly 20,000 relevant human genes are known to be possible pathogenic changes in DNA – so-called mutations – that would come from the clinic.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a firm desire to use the data for research into other diseases as well.,, the Clinof the Foundation in Davos, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine,, the expert, into bioinformatics the expert.
In the case of a medical examination, the patient should be informed that the patient is not able to obtain a medical certificate.
According to UKE, the inheritance of a human being can be decrypted within 24 hours, and the real cost of this would be EUR 1300; the first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost hundreds of millions of euros; the study is due to start on 1 October; all 9000 samples are to be analysed by the end of 2020; the first results are expected to be published in 2001.
Nigerian police are freeing hundreds of abused boys.
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a coral attack, and after evidence from residents, the school in the North Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were minors, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused, some of whom said they had been raped by their teachers.
The boys were detained on the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Qur'an; indeed, the protégés were detained by their teachers under "most degrading and inhumane conditions", Sabo said.
According to the figures, the Koran school has been in existence for some ten years, and the authorities have drawn attention to repeated irregularities in the institution, and the parents have been shocked to learn about the conditions in the Koran School, Sabo said that they had not been punished by the suffering of their children, and that the operator and six staff were arrested according to the police.
Nigerian is a country in the northeast of the country, with a population of about 40,000, and a population of about 40,000.
Supported and tortured: Nigeria's police release 400 children from school
Policemen in a school in northern Nigeria freed almost 400 students from appalling conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries pointing to torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
On Thursday, after a note in an Islamic school, the children were discovered, and the conditions there were 'degrading to human beings'.
The children, all boys, were kept at their school like slaves and laid on chains; some were sexually abused; TV pictures showed dismal and injured students in a noticeably poor state of health.
World Cup Choice: Further allegations of Messis and Klopps Kür
Football 'Signature not valid'
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded the award.
With a gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year.
After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he had never voted for the World Cup election, other countries were accused of the Fifa. Egypt was not even judged – with a curious justification.
Much of the Fifa ’ s past years have proven to be anemic: the World Cup awards, dubious plans by its president, Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. But the Fifa World Cup election has not so far been suspected of running neatly - if one disregards the fact that the voting national trainers and national team capitals of member federations are often more likely to vote for sympathy than objectively.
But, after Nicaragua ’ s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account; indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The Fifa apologises to the effect that 'the signatures on the electoral forms have been issued in capital letters and have therefore not been valid', and that the Egyptian Association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudans Trainer also amazes.
Although the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Association admits that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally judged: with Lionel Messi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera also had allegations: "Have not voted for the # TheBest2019 Awards, all the information on my voice is wrong, thank you", he wrote,,,,,.
On Friday, the Association announced that it was right to vote, but of course it was not intended to do so.
The other cases have now been investigated by the Fifa, but it is emphasised that the electoral process has been supervised externally by the PriceWaterhouseCoopers consulting firm, and Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Cup election - and Jürgen Klopp World Champion of the Year.
Ukraine ’ s Affair: Ranghohe Republicans are in favor of official investigation.
Two senior Republicans have openly advocated an official investigation against US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," the Republican governor of the US state, Vermont, Phil Scott, said. "Where this leads from here, the facts are determined," he wants to know more about whistleblowers before taking action.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the whistleblower-affair, few have shown unease, and Scott ’ s remarks are now a first sign in Trump ’ s party, with the moderate governor of Virginia repeatedly opposing Trump ’ s policies, such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke in favour of the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course of action and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get it to the bottom."
Scott and Baker, as governor of US states, formally did not have a say in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided in Congress, so their pronouncements are symbolically important, but the Republicans ’ first senators have also been critical of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second parliamentary chamber, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing".
The affair could result in the launch of an impeachment proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into it, alleging abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment; with the majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could push for so-called impeachment; but the decision to effectively impeachment would be in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority; so far, no US president has been dismissed by an impeachment procedure.
Was Folterer an Board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they have been raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after having illegally fired the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees.
Now, new serious accusations are being made against rackets: three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps with the 'Sea-Watch 3' arrived in Italy; the suspects have been caught in a detention centre in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had rediscovered their embarrassment in Italy. 'We cannot rule out that,, but we have no information on it,,' Sea Watch ', said Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
In mid-September, the police said that the suspects in the North African country were raped, tortured, and even murdered; they were Muhammad C. (27) of Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and atrocities exposed - through repeated and constant physical violence," said the communication.
NGO and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are, who come without passports," said a newcomer, and torture is one of the main reasons why the people of Libya are fleeing, so it is quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed up".
Italy ’ s right-wing former Minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini, was immediately apologizing for the revenge against which Italy is still being investigated for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk aspires to extradition records at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given a strong boost to his electric car company with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could buy 110,000 orders, and Musk ’ s circular letter continued. The challenge is to bring cars quickly to the clientele, with Tesla having to provide as many resources as possible to the quarterly.
In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars, reaching its previous peak.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals, with a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars delivered in 2019, with six-figure figures in the current and next quarter-year, and the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low,.
US budget dispute: Once again, only bridge-financing
The new financial year will start in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget, and the Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and adopted transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to raise spending ceilings for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States will once again have no spending plans ahead of the new fiscal year starting on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and adopted a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) by November 21, without which it would have come to a shutdown on Monday, a partial shutdown by the federal.
Shutdown
For the time being, the federal government is being funded at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019, which ends on Monday, because Congress cannot agree on the 12 spending laws that allocate funds to the various departments and authorities, so the federal government cannot benefit from the $1.4 Bio for the new financial year.
The Democrats, in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, have made ten of the twelve laws, but the spending laws reflect Democrats ’ priorities, which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the 12 spending plans more or less ready, which are barely multi-majority.
In the Senate, Republicans seem to be trying to impose $12 billion on the Wall, one of the major priorities of President Trump, and Democrats are bothering about the Wall plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects.
At Mauerbau, the spirits divorce.
At the moment, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue, and it is more likely that agreement on all twelve spending laws will be extended beyond 21 November in the next seven weeks, and a shutdown is not ruled out either.
In view of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the 12 spending laws in good time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas are gaining in popularity to automate the process. Temporary p. 1877 to avoid Shutdowns, federal government financing would automatically continue at the same level as the previous year, discourage parliamentarians ’ travel, and withhold their wages, until the new annual spending plans.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization will continue to be open to all women and lesbians: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that would allow all women to benefit from in-vitro fertilization, which is likely to increase demand for anonymous sperm pends.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics on the right had warned that in the future many "children without father" could grow up.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that defended health minister Agnès Buzyn as an "opportunity" for society, and it is the modern family in which children with only one parent or homosexual parents are given the cost of artificial insemination for all women.
Breeding with sperm of dead husband further prohibited
By a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would allow widows for artificial insemination access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain, and the United Kingdom, artificial insemination is "post-mortem".
Many members of the governing La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition opposed the artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner.
The initiators of the amendment, which has now failed, find it unfair that a widow can be fertilised in the future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of their own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is permitted only to heterosexual couples who cannot testify to children, who must be married or live together for at least two years, and Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain banned.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, however, it is often difficult.
Climate compensation: calls for flights to Unis will become louder.
There is a lot of work going on in universities, and that is why the country wants to have a climate levy imposed on it in the future, and the rectors say that they have no money for it, but now they are under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying: photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte.
The debate on a climate levy on university and university flights postponed before the summer recess is getting off the ground again, and now the plans are being supported by the universities in a conference by the green black coalition.
Russia Recalls North Korean fishermen
According to the secret service FSB, the detainees were illegally caught in Russian waters and, ten days earlier, 161 fishermen were already detained from North Korea, when there was a shield between the border guards and the boat crew, with three Russians and a North Korean being injured, and the fisherman subsequently suffered serious injuries, but there were no injured this time.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, and North Korean fishermen have therefore travelled in Russian territorial waters, where Russia ’ s coastguard, according to its own data, is patrolling its marine biological resources.
30,000 octopus fish seized.
In the case of renewed controls, 30,000 octopus were discovered and confiscated on boats, and three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia ’ s fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs, with thousands of North Korean fishermen being temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently complained about high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who fished in Russia ’ s banned narrow-meshed synthetic nets, which would also take small creatures out of the sea, and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
In future, only 18.000: the US will lower the asylum ceiling.
The 'most generous nation in history': Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is closing itself off against defenders: as the State Department in Washington has confirmed, the ceiling on the legal granting of refugees will be lowered further, and, in future, mainly threatened creditors and Iraqis will be granted asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees once again, and, in the economic year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are expected to be left in the country, as the US State Department has said.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has drastically reduced the readiness for protection seekers from around the world in recent years, with far higher revenue limits being applied under Barack Obama ’ s predecessor government.
The target of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US Refugee Program was launched in 1980, but the Department of Foreign Affairs described the US as "the most impoverished and generous nation in history," a phrase that is strongly reminiscent of the incumbent US president's language.
A "responsible handling" of refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild, Trump explained, but there is also massive criticism of his hard line in migration policy.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to seal off, and to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency; whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially imminent impeachment.,,,,,, is.,,,,,,
The US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future, according to the Foreign Office: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country, thereby endangering it, as stated in the State Department statement.
The US wants people from this' northern triangle 'of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries in particular, and it is against this background that the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.
Tribunal ordered release of Orang-Utan from zoo
An Orange Utan female was transferred to the United States at the request of the Argentine justice system from the former Buenos Aires zoo, and the Sandra Zoo, born in Rostock in 1986, granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release was mandatory.
As the 53 kilograms of heavy human activity are unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, they will live in the Center for Great Apes in Florida, where 21 other orang-utans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed, including "Bubbles", formerly the pet of Popstar Michael Jackson, but in in Florida Sand, a quarantine in Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Canada.
"Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock, before moving to Buenos Aires in 1995.
Rekord für Schweizer Extrembergsteiger: 550 Meter in 46 Minuten.
Dani Arnold, the extreme mountaineer, was lucky to have a new cough ride on the nearly 3,000 metre high Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a network, double ground or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high northern wall of the Great Zinne in a new record time.
With Jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom of vibration, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent.
Arnold is now record holder in Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy.
Despite the trade dispute with China, the US sports goods manufacturer Nike has booked a substantial profit plus, with net profit rising to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (just under €1.3 billion), which is 25% more than in the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday, mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor goes online to its customers.
The company's revenues increased to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August, with the largest sales of the Nike, with a plus of 22% in China, benefiting from Beaverton in Oregon, the US federal state, from its approach to direct consumers through the Internet or smartphone app.
Finance chief Andy Campion announced that Nike would press ahead with the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer with strategic investments, thereby expanding its competitive advantage.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
For reasons of racist comments about football profile Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association of the Italian capital imposed a life-long stadium ban on a fan.
The club reacted late on Thursday, noting the fan's account at Instagram and the police, and never again allowing Roma supporters to visit a game of the club, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football, with Italian fans regularly scoring racist insults against black players of rival teams. 'We cannot have racism in society or in sport; in Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious.
However, there were also discussions among the supporters of Juventus Turin, and the Italian authorities have now banned 38 stranded supporters of record champions Juventus Turin from the stadium, and four of them are unlikely to enter the stadium for a ten-year period, and the police have informed them that bans will apply from four to seven years.
The club had launched an ad last year in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fighters around Juventus, accused, among other things, of serious blackmail, money laundering and private violence.
The ultra-leaders are supposed to be behind the black market after Italian media reports, and they should have 'controlled' the fancy curve militarily and blackmailed Juventus staff to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennium is narcissistic, the Z generation is political - whole vintages are thought of with handsome names.
"The crabs come!" This reputation officially launched the crab fishing at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun on September 21, which also marked the opening ceremony of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Relations of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones.
The people of Gaochun have already started crab breeding in the early 1990s, and over the years the crab industry has become a prominent industry that has generated high incomes and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun.
In recent years, Gaochun has promoted a reform of the "distribution of power, optimisation of administration and of government services" and carefully established the service network for "permits under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending", in order to fully optimize the city's environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun utilizes the local advantages by linking it to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a trailer for intelligent high-end production plants, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health industries, as well as organic farming enterprises, which are leading the way in the "3 + 2" area, and Gaochun has developed a national development zone, tourism and tourist areas, which have been promoted by means of national tourism and tourist centres, and the environmental and cultural resources of the Gaochun region, and the public service, the "+ tourism and tourism services".
Conflict between Iran and the US: Rouhani talks about the end of sanctions – Trump is against Trump.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions, and the United States, in exchange for talks with the Tehran leader, promised an end to all sanctions, declared Rouhani on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, replied to the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: 'Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions against him so that there is a meeting; I said, of course, no'.
Ruhani describes what happened: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting should take place. 'And America says I lift the sanctions on', added Ruhani.
However, this move was not carried out in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised, and no one could predict the outcome of negotiations, given the current punitive measures and 'the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure'.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York, with Europeans hoping to rescue the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated with Russia and China, which is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, expressed the hope at at the UN General that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
Following the recent shock of two earthquakes, Western Turkey is growing in fear of catastrophe, with 34 people injured on Tuesday in the earthquake, and almost 200 aftershocks occurred on the previous day, according to Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 shocked Marmararegion in Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the metropolis of millions, and now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul ’ s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, has said that the city itself is repeatedly ignored the latent danger, and that badly built homes are falling every year, made, among other things, tired by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
For years, urban planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have warned that large open spaces, which were registered in the centre as sanctuaries, have long since been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük Bebens in August, the Construction Chamber in Istanbul warned that a million buildings in Istanbul were not enviable.
The epicentre of the earthquake of Thursday lay in Marmara in front of Silivri and around seven kilometres deep, as the civil protection authority Afad pointed out, and a smaller aftercaused even greater panin the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu announced on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported initially.
Istanbul is considered to be a particularly earthquake-prone area, with a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian Ground Plate, where Turkey is constantly being shaken by earthquakes, one of the most deadly was the earthquake near Istanbul in 1999, when more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude could threaten 7.1 to 7.4, but when the earthquake occurs, it is unclear that the earthquake on Thursday again hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies draw up emergency plans, private individuals have packed so-called go-tags with everything necessary next door, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wakes up. When the next big earthquake comes, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that eight people had been injured after his return from New York, and some buildings had suffered slight damage, with Istanbul ’ s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, following developments from the Istanbul Civil Coordination Center (Akom).
Warning against Posting in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic; buildings were wounded; schools and hospitals were evacuated; telephone lines were interrupted; they were more violent than Tuesday ’ s, writes a user; the head of the Turkish Red Half Monds, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter about the aftermath; he called on people to stay away from buildings that would have suffered visible damage.
According to official information, the time of the earthquake is 1: 59 (local time), and only a few minutes after the first earthquake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a post-earthquake earthquake that was reported at 4.0 on the Richter scale.
It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmararegion - it was felt up to Istanbul - and its epicentre was located in Marmara west of the metropolis of millions, and the Afad Civil Protection Agency announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a serious earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high; scientists believe that they will unload at some point - and cause massive damage.
Earthforscher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now, as he said to CNN Türk. "These may be the signs of a major earthquake," says Ersoy to the Sender. "Sooner or later, the great earthquake will also come.
Just a few weeks ago, there was an incident - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul, and there was a violent earthquake in Albania just a few days ago - there were 68 injured, and the soil was also burnt this year.
Parliament: New ignition material in Ukrainian
Two brilliant documents provide new ignition in the Ukraine-affair for possible abuses of power by US President Donald Trump, encouraging US Democrats to pursue a possible impeachment process: a complaint filed by an anonymous signatory about Trump and his controversial telephone deal with the Ukrainian president provides important evidence of an investigation against the president.
USA: United Airlines passenger detained in toilet - Flyer diverted.
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a United Airlines flight was redirected, and the WC door had been blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the flight in 1554, the airline told the US media.
During an extraordinarily scheduled stopover at the Mittwochabend (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be freed from the narrow cabin.
In a video broadcast on the Internet, which is supposed to come from flight 1554 according to the US media, we can see how several people are trying to free the woman. 'At the moment, we are working to open the door, Ma'am, and we will soon get you out, Okay?' says a man, the airline apologised to all passengers.
The Kakerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel.
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit mess? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous narrative, "The Relation", the British author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book on Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27, informed Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now the most powerful man in Britain.
McEwan was quoted as saying: 'If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers are shamelessly lying like the Soviet leaders when Brexiteers, in high positions, come up with the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do; there is only one answer:'.
In 1915, Kafka's first published narrative was written by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into an enormous untargeted", is gradually excluded from the family and society, and finally, "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands in its head", it was written by Diogenes Verlag.
The EU is investing EUR 9.5 million in Austria's rail infrastructure.
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary get brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains, as well as modernising and electrifying sections of railway connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna Neustadt and Sopron.
According to the EU authority, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, and the funds come from the EU infrastructure fund 'Connecting Europe Facility'.

Prince Harry destroys Sprengmine in Angola
For a long time now, Prince Harry has continued the commitment of Lady Diana, and in Africa he is now turning directly into the traces of his mother.
With a blue splinter, the British Prince Harry lit and destroyed a explosive tank in Angola.
On Friday morning, close to a camp of the British Halo Trust at Dirico, he set up the Zündkreis in front of running TV cameras, while the exploded exploded in the Savannenland exploded safely, without harm. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-old bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mines that threaten the population.

Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute.
In fact, Premier Boris Johnson had clearly set out: he will not give a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements are perpetual in the polarizing British; the recent ruling by the Supreme Court in Britain is like a sword of Damocles over the Blondschopf; his suspension of Parliament to be able to hold his Brexit course down to the expiry date was annulled earlier this week; and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to do so in the event of failed negotiations with the EU until 31 October, which had led to a prolongation of bilateral talks with Johnson, which had always been categorically ruled out.
Boris Johnson still considers Deal possible.
But the pressure does not seem to be noticeably over Johnson, who, when visiting a hospital, suggested that he would support an extension of the negotiations in the event of a non-agreement by the end of October:
Know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal, I am cautiously optimistic that this.
And the time is beginning to run out of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels, with the EU and British negotiators having time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without agreements for about six weeks, but the recent talks have not yet reached a breakthrough, and an agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister fails to do so, a new postponement of the exit date will come into force, but the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister ’ s words, fearing that Johnson could somehow a no-deal in the case of Brexit.
US Authority: Further deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has risen to 12, and there have now been 805 confirmed and likely injured in this regard, with a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that there have been more than 900 people affected, some 500 of them confirmed, and the cause of lung damage is still completely unclear.
The Fear of New Protests in Egypt Grows
The video of Mohammed Ali was divided into online networks, calling for a "popular revolution" in Spain, and calling for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement.
There are several underground stations closed and streets closed around central Tahrir Square.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
In the past few months, the government of Egypt has been calling for the arrest of almost 2,000 people.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country, so the government has blocked websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi, which has ruled the country since 2013, after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Mursi.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Greenland Expedition back.
The Polarforscher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday, and was greeted by the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climatic activist Greta Thunberg with the race yacht "Malizia" across the Atlantic when he arrived at the Port of Hamburg.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has studied and documented the consequences of global warming in recent months on his sailboat "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Futures movement is a blessing, said the Polar Forscher, who has waited for years for the young generation to speak, knowing for decades that the earth is warming, yet many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place with the exclusion of the public," Fuchs said, "He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and tiredness of the seas.
For his "struggle for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the Polarforscher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the context of the Hamburg climate week.
Teure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for noodles 430 euros.
There are also a number of restaurants in the city that offer a wide variety of food and drinks.
"Such cases damage the image of Rome, and we call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," said a Federagit spokesman, the travel guide association in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The hotel is located in the heart of the city, close to the main train station and the city centre.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken, US President Donald Trump could actually face an impeachment procedure following the turbulent revelations of the past few days that Democrats want to examine it in the House as soon as possible, from weeks to a decision.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj appears, and the accusation of whistleblowers, which has brought to the public the conversation out of concern for national security and democracy in the United States with his complaint, is monstrous: the President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize another country ’ s government ’ s influence on the 2020 election, using Ukraine ’ s dependence to blackmail, thereby forcing it to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be found in the interview with Selenskyj, which has now been published, although it does not reflect the full text, but the telephone on 25 July is just an episode of a much larger story, in whose center, alongside Trump, stands above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
History starts in May 2019, when the New York Times reports of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine; he wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. 'We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation into what we have the right to do', he says, the newspaper.
The attorney and former New York mayor seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that were fixed on Trump ’ s 2016 counter-candidate: Hillary Clinton has conjured up with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia ’ s investigations in the US, but this charge was never taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will be so prominent on the phone with Selenskyj in July, with the version of Giulianis and the president: the former vice-president and currently promising Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, pushed the former Obama administration ’ s Obama administration to dismiss the then Ukrainian general prosecutor, Viktor Schokin, to stop the gas-company investigation that he was responsible for.
In fact, when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Prosecutor should go, investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden had never been directly affected, and Schokin was also deeply accused of corrupt behavior, with the US government far from being the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal.

Everest-Stau photographer: 13 Eighteen thousand in six months.
A nepalesian mountaineer, according to his own data, has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within only six months.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eighteen thousand in seven months.
The image of the mass transport triggered a debate on stronger security measures at the 8848 metre high mountain and highest peak on earth.
A problem for Purja could be the ascendancy of the 14th 1980 ’ s: at the moment, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet, owing, among other things, to bad weather. Earlier this, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal ’ s government wanted to talk to China to allow him to rise.
Four Dead Elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
One of the dead animals was also a dreadful elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. 'We suspect that the elephant was poisoned'.
The four Kadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year, and the perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously been shamelessly kept. At the same time, around 50 people are killed every year by elephants, mostly when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
In Sri Lanka, it is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants are still living, and the death penalty is theoretically being killed.
Main-held British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port town of Bandar Abbas for more than two months after his arrest by Iran, which was announced by the Maritime Office of Bandar Abbas, according to the IRNA news agency.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to examine the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook extensively, in order to deal with the salary packages of the Executive Board as well as the question of why the British Government was not able to provide financial assistance to the struggling company. "Our interest is to supervise the company as well as to control external auditors," said Chairman Rachel Reeves, in London.
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of colorectal cancer.
The role of genes in the family ’ s increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far, with researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) in a recent study. Other risk factors, such as family dietary habits, probably weigh more heavily than previously assumed, with consequences for calculations of individual colorectal cancer risk, emphasizing the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk has raised Tesla shares.
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek".
The challenge is to bring cars quickly to the clientele, and Tesla must provide as many resources as possible to the quarterly.
In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95 '000 cars, reaching its current peak.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals, with a total of 360 '000 to 400' 000 cars in 2019, with six-figure figures in the current and next quarter of the year, and the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low, and despite the boom, losses were.
Will the UK government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson retire?
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is seeking ways to circumvent the recent law passed by Parliament against unregulated Brexit, and he simply told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the death penalty if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October, which Johnson criticizes as the "capitulation law" that aggravates negotiations with the EU.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major commented that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU left.
Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union. 'We are confident that the EU will leave on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement'.
Iran seems to be driving up uranium enrichment.
Iran ’ s President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on Europe ’ s contracting partners in the battle to save the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, Europe ’ s states show incapacity or unwillingness to take concrete action," said Rohani at a press conference on Thursday at the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York.
The conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, in return, contained the promise to normalize economic relations with Tehran, began in 2018 alone from the agreement to force Iran to change course as an aggressive Middle East policy. President Donald Trump ’ s government wants to negotiate a new deal with tougher constraints, and is now back on tough sanctions against Tehran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least has prepared the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September, using uranium, and, according to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps Europeans would not be prepared to bear their share of the deal, leaving Iranians alone with the costs and burden of stifling US sanctions, but there will be further talks, hopefully a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran ’ s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
But, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen had become aware of the attack, which the US regarded as a false commitment. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must produce evidence of this," said Rohani, but they would not have skillfully summoned the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN general debate; instead, they would have invoked the rebels in Yemen not to carry out an attack like this.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the US administration ’ s far-reaching sanctions would have to be lifted, calling on Rouhani ’ s government in Washington to pursue a policy of “dialogue and reason. ”
Comet of another star crosses the solar system.
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe, which was first achieved, and the comet allows conclusions to be made about other solar systems.
What was initially only a presumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crossed by our solar system.
On August 30, the most extensive comet was discovered by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres diameter.
2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be seen at a flight of our solar system after 1I / 'Oumuamua of 2017.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get a close insight into a strange solar system before it disappears on Nimmerwiedersehen.
According to the analysis, the comet travels on a so-called Hyperbelbahn, which takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) indicated, also responsible for designating and categorizing celestial bodies.
Astronomers are lucky: in contrast to 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov was already sighted in the beginning, so researchers stay for many months for investigations.' The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be visible by April 2020 with medium sized telescopes', Farnocchia explained.
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor, such as a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I / 'Oumuamua, in a first study showing the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers from the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of interstellar welders offering a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of our solar system comets, and this points out that its composition must be similar", reported IAC researcher Julia de León.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
By 2028, the agency intends to set up the three-part space-sond "Comet Interceptor" (in German, cometen-descending hunters) on a waiting position of 1.5 million kilometres from the Earth, which, according to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, is to be either on an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I /'Oumuamua.
First landing at Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
Just before the 70th anniversary of the People ’ s Republic, the new mega-airport in the south of China ’ s capital is a first China United Airlines passenger aircraft, a special honor for captain and crew.
China ’ s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project, and China ’ s recent prestige project is also called “Seestern ” because of its six-axis structure.
The complex has four runways, which will be extended to seven later, and is equipped with the world ’ s largest automatic air traffic management system.
During the construction process, the Chinese had said on several occasions that Berlin could learn from Beijing, but the opening of the capital city airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has been postponed time and again, while in Beijing,, a first passenger aircraft has been since four years.
New Overall Aircraft is to fly in 2030: four and a half hours from London to Sydney.
From London to Sydney, just four and a half hours away, the UK Space Agency is dreaming of doing this, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, quoted by the US channel CNN. "This is the technology that could definitely do the job," said GraGraham Turnock.,, ", we,,,,,, and,,, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours.

Disorder in Washington: Trump wants to find anonymous tippers in Ukraine ’ s affair.
In Ukraine ’ s affair of possible US President Donald Trump ’ s abuse of power, he wants to see possible undue posts in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblowers the information," Trump said on Thursday to US envoy staff at the United Nations in New York.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tippers, but the event was not public, and several US media broadened audio recordings on Friday from the address, with Democrats responding outrageously to the president ’ s statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced on Tuesday preparations for an impeachment proceedings against Trump, with their allegations based primarily on the written complaint by an anonymous intelligence officer who makes serious accusations against Trump and his head of government.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to receive information from several government officials that the US president "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country meddles in its favor in the US election in 2020.
At the heart of the allegations is a contentious telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, dealing with former deals by Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his castles from Ukraine ’ s judiciary. Biden is in the race for the Democratic presidential election in 2020.
The whistleblowers accused the White House, with a view to the Ukraine-Telefonat, of the cover-up: senior government officials would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the blanket, as usual an electronic word-read protocol, but this was removed from a database normally provided for in the White House, and was instead stored in a particularly protected system.
The New York Times reported that it was supposed to be a member of the CIA ’ s foreign intelligence service.
On Friday, Trump re-questioned the credibility of the source; in a series of tweets on the issue, the president wrote, among other things, that the "whistleblower" had disseminated second-hand information that would have proved to be incorrect, so there may be no tippers or spies at all.
As Trump said in New York about the whistleblowers, but outrage arose, with US House Chairman Nancy Pelosi reacting alarmingly and lamenting Trump ’ s statement underscoring the government ’ s integrity.
The House of Representatives has been conducting various investigations against Trump and his environment for months in various committees, and, with Ukraine ’ s accusations, the Democrats are now launching investigations with new anguish to launch a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
"The whistleblowers gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the House of Representatives ’ Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff.
More than 300 former US officials from the security and foreign-policy spheres, mostly democratic, but also Republican presidents, took part in a statement released on Friday behind the Democrats ’ enquiry for a possible impeachment process. If the allegations were true, it would be Trump ’ s “unscrupulous abuse of power. ”
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure, with the majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats may be pushing for a so-called impeachment procedure, but the decision on a real impeachment would be in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority, so the prospects for such a process ’ s success are small.
VW Works Council: Jobs are "creeping down".
The VW brand ’ s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe, which is driving the auto industry ’ s works council to cut its annual factory costs from €10 billion to €2 billion by 2023, saving €500 million this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between companies and works councils between 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020.
As our newspaper has now learned from working councils, however, jobs in production, which are not actually at a disposition, are being cut over a different path - that is, the official course - so that vacant regular posts are often not re-filled.
In these cases, the works council does not have the option of forcing the re-occupation; meanwhile, there is a lack of staff to take work condensation, which would increase concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants, and also fears that vehicle production could gradually be deducted from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world,:,,,,,,, the,,,,, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The VW brand wants to standardise production worldwide and manage new projects centrally, thereby reducing costs and accelerating - the goal of increasing productivity and hence competitiveness - Andreas at Berlin:,,,,,,,,,,, the gap between,,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the first time since 2013 that production costs per vehicle have been reduced compared to the previous year.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced.
As Tostmann has already announced last year, Wolfsburg's "perspektivisch" will be able to roll a million cars from the band, which will make it possible to bundle the Gulf production in the trunk - because the Zwickau plant makes conversion into a location for e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg, but the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have declined recently, so the expectations are now on the Gulf 8.
With Voodoo forced into prostitution: human traffickers condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been torn to rest, forced into prostitution, and six suspected traffickers have been imprisoned.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced in Bochum on Friday to trial and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months, and the defendants had forced young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and into prostitution. To force their obedience, Nigerian emigrants had to give a ritual boost to a voodoo priest ’ s home country.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old, but they were brought into the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers, but the dream of a better future did not come to Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to cover the supposed smugglers' costs of an average of EUR 25 000, and the wage was therefore completely reduced.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the entry and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians to Bordelle in the trial. 'The work made women physically and mentally difficult to create', said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the verdict proclaim. 'Some were'.
The judgments refer to commercial and cast-iron entry of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa.
FIm Dauerstreit mit dem Lufthansa Group hat die Flugbegleitergewerkschaft Ufo erneut mit Streiks gedroht.
In the event that the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform the LH Group on 14 October about the industrial action," said Ufo-Tarifvorstand Daniel Flohr on Friday.
On this point, after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court, Ufo now sees itself strengthened, and Lufthansa wanted to state that the collective agreements were not cancelled, and the Court rejected the applications, confirming the decision and examining the appeal against it. 'The fact that a second court sees the matter in a completely different way seems unlikely,' said Ufo Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted a request to the Frankfurt National Labour Court to review the status of Ufo as a trade union, arguing that the trade union has not been a responsible board for months and has thus been unable to fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
In the course of which many members of the Board of Directors, including the long-time trade union leader Nicoley Baublies, resigned due to doubts about their leadership, a vote on strikes by the cabin crew at the end of July at Eurowings.
Eased entry: Saudi Arabia announces a new visa system.
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but that is now to change, and the country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa rules.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the Tourism Commission announced that international and domestic visitors would increase to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the Chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has been heavily accessible to tourists, and Visawerden usually only hopes for short business trips, religious pilgrimages, or visitors to the desert states, with the new rules that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is hoping for more revenue from the tourism business.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones hit two of Saudi Arabia ’ s most important oil plants in the East: the country ’ s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field, which drastically cut domestic oil production, which is likely to take several weeks to restore its old level of oil production.

Two aircraft crash deaths in the Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic, and the wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the town of Mecin (Metschin).
On Thursday evening, the authorities had been looking for the machine after the crew had given an emergency signal by GPS, and a military helicopter was also in use in the search, and the accident has yet to be investigated, and the crash is about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are at risk of extinction.
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are the causes of the threat, IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels on the World Conservation Union, investigating stocks of all 454 species known in Europe, 265 of which do not occur on any other continent, 58% of which are under threat, 66 of which are already at the highest level of risk and, therefore, extinction.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: potentially endangered by "through" endangered "," endangered "," threatened "by extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct".
Eberesche and wild Rosskastanie are threatened.
In Germany, especially Ebereschen (Sorbus) was threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, said to the German press agency. "Most are under because,, the population is so or because their habitats are transformed or weakened.
IUCN-Skala is the largest threat to the Balkan Miniermotte.
Strauchts and moose are also at risk.
The IUCN scientists created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs, and moose at the same time, and more than one-fifth of the molluscs and mosses, and almost half of all the shrubs, such as the IUCN, are threatened by the destruction of the wilderness, of catchment species, agricultural practices, and climate change.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. "We must limit the impact of human beings on our ecosystems and prioritise the protection of these species.
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured, and, according to the figures, dozens of people would have had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, the Turkish Vice-President, Fuat Oktay, said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have therefore been damaged, with almost 200 aftershocks since the earthquake on the previous day, with the earthquake of magnitude 5.8 rocking the Marmararegion in front of Istanbul on Thursday and causing panic in the millions of metropolis.
Now the government wants to use a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced, and in the last 20 years Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul ’ s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be a particularly earthquake-prone area, with a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder marking the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian Grounds.
One of the heaviest earthquakes was 7.6 in 1999, near Istanbul.
On Tuesday, the strength of 4.6 had already shaken the region around Istanbul, with the authorities calling on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the half-time show.
The Latin-Pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the mid-term show of the next American-Football-Finals Super Bowl, which will on Twitter.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of joining the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying in the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I will perform with another Latina".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honoured to stand alongside another artist on one of the largest stages in the world and represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queens" stand together on a stage.
Shakira was born in New York, where her parents came from Puerto Rico.
Fighting Falling Actors
The Super Bowl is the culmination of the American Football season, with the game and the half-time show being one of the most watched TV broadcasts in the US, even though you have recently fallen: this February, the spectacle in the US has the least specfor more than ten years, yet almost a hundred million people have still.
There was a uproar in the run-up to the six-month Super Bowl review: in the quarterback with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, media reports reported that Topstars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear; after all, the Maroon 5 pop group led the half-time show - the critics were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then Quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was on the knees in the 2016 / 17 NFL game at the National Anthem in protest against police violence and racism.
Cook-bust: Hotels get money from insurance.
Some banks are likely to be expensive in the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report, with high write-offs on outstanding bonds and loans, including Credit Suisse, writes Friday's Financial Times.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit, or Credit Suisse would probably have to write write-offs of up to £1.8 billion (around €2 billion) on their books, as the consultant AlixPartners estimates.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase write-offs of £900 million to £1 billion, and lenders of £550 to £825 million. The amounts actually to be write-offs are likely to be higher at the top of the bandwidths, said an expert on the sheet.
How large the losses of creditors will ultimately be will be after the insolvency proceedings have expired, and a person close to that process does not claim too much hope, for example, the roughly 40 Thomas Cook aircraft in the United Kingdom are "old" and many of the properties are in bad locations.
Rackete is said to have brought alleged murderers to Italy
The Sea-Watch captain, Carola Rackete, may have brought men to Italy to torture and murdered people in Libya. "We cannot rule out this, but we have no secure information on it ourselves," said the spokesman of the Sea-Watch refugee organisation, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have rediscovered the three men in Italy, accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya, and accused the alleged perpetrators of being arrested in the detention centre in Messina, Italy, and of rebby refugee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On 29 June, Carola Rackete brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa, collecting a ship from the Italian financial police, and on that day the three suspects should also have arrived there, and the captains are investigating the aid to illegal immigration.
US Federal Government Warn Huawei
The head of the US Internet Administration Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too big, "said Pai of the" Handelsblatt "with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that each company "under Chinese jurisdiction" obliges to comply with instructions from the security bodies.
The law in force also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests ", says the FCC chief, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of confidence" from suppliers.
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" based on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible, and the 5G technology is not just hardware:
This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, "said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "wherever, would be able to review each single update in real time to detect security risks," said the FCC chief.
China ’ s Huawei Group has established close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The owners are opaque, and the company, which is supposed to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, "said Pai the" trade sheet ".
Pai was recently in Berlin to promote the US position.
Chemiefabrik in northern France: schools closed.
During the night, residents hear explosions, a gigantic firewall illuminated the sky above a North French chemical factory, and the fire was removed after hours - but the cleanup could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches remain closed in the region.
The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to stand up to the smoke.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture pointed out, and there is still a risk that, after the deletion of the smell, the prefecture would spread on Twitter.
The chemical factory had previously been a gigantic black smoke column, and French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which produced oil additives, located a few kilometres from the city centre.
The plant in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored after official information.
It is the largest city in Normandy.
Rouen is a regional metropolis located on the Seine between Paris and the port town of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: 'Germany must invest now'
France ’ s Economic and Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, "said Le Maire on Thursday evening when the French budget was presented for next year.
The eurozone economy is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to deteriorate in order to take the necessary decisions'.
Action would require those states that would have fiscal room for more investment, as Le Maire said, among other things, with Germany.
France did not add these margins, added the minister and pointed to its country's high public debt, which is more than 98% of GDP, and the French public debt must be 'stabilised' and 'reduced', Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy, and, in return, German politicians have repeatedly urged France to address its budget deficit.
The French 2020 budget presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government is thus responding, among other things, to the Yellow West Movement ’ s protests, with the new debt expected to fall to 2.2%, according to 3.1% this year.
Is he still trying to trickle? Johnson about Brexit tactics?
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises Parliament's' Capitalisation Act '.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes to the British prime minister to avoid a chaos-bloxit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson might still use a loophole, but this possibility is what Tory politicians are trying to do.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to impose an unregulated Brexit – despite the recent law passed by Parliament, which is precisely what this is supposed to prevent – and Johnson said to journalists that his government will abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the death penalty if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October, and Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" that aggravates negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister, John Major, said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use 'political harassment' to circumvent the law, and that the Prime Minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after the withdrawal of the EU.
Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, declared that he felt the political battles over Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the desired exit from the EU would come about: "We enjoy that, we will win, we will leave (Anm. Red: from the EU), no concern," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" according to a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 EU referendum, is now serving as chief strategist in Downing Street, the UK ’ s seat of government, behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into an outright situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera by Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very big rock photographers, but it doesn't always have to be the great glamour.
Paul McCartney, who was married from 1969 to Lindas in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented The Polaroid Diaries in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, including Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison, and Pretenders-FrontChrissi.
After the Launch Event McCartney wrote at Instagram: "# ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film".
At Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there, and thousands of Polaroids made it, some hundred of them are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
They are portraits, still-life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "They wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword, and of course there one: your Paul - as you may never have seen him.
He was born in New York City, New York, where he lived in New York City.
Like hardly any other medium, the Polorai camera captures the immediate moment.
It ’ s about choosing: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you, and then you have to kneel at the exact moment, ” said Paul McCartney. “Knipst you two seconds later or two seconds sooner, it can be a completely different photo, ” and Linda would have had the gift to capture always exactly the right moment. ” She knew that she had it, ” Paul said in the Eshun-Essay.
In this respect, the light, the composition, the section of the picture and the colours, which "The Polaroid Diaries" not only makes an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but besides all anecdotes, is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also work like abstract paintings.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from neighboring countries, despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying in an interview released on Friday that Turkey cannot break oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, "said Erdogan in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
But Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, because some companies "withdrew because of US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey 'will continue our relations with Iran on this issue in particular and on many other issues', the Turkish President, who has repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic since its exit from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, according to the US, a nuclear program in secret and does not comply with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran ’ s oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf have intensified significantly in recent months.
The US Government wants to restrict the reception of refugees.
The US government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees, and the US State Department declared on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from now 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, equivalent to a 40% cut.
The Department of Foreign Affairs said that while the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens, as the US immigration system is currently overburdened.
The US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who helped the US military in the country, thereby endangering them, as stated in the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In the 1980 program, refugees from UN camps around the world are being selected and resettled in the US, with the ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year being the lowest in the program ’ s history. The current ceiling of 30,000 is low. As US President Donald Trump ’ s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was just under 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted to the announced lowering of the ceiling, "a very sad day for America," said David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee, who would continue to damage their leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to limit immigration into the US, both legally and illegally, and the US government, according to its own figures, expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year, which are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a nickel"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage of whistleblowers, who, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York, has consistently reported several US media.
So, when asked about the person who informed the whistleblowers about controversial White House events, Trump replied: "This comes close to a nickel," Add Trump: "Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart?
The Democrats strongly criticized Trump ’ s statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses, as well as an attempt to impede a congressional investigation into possible impeachment proceedings against him, the chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Supervision in the House of Representatives wrote.
The whistleblowers accuse the president of abusing his office in a complaint that has now been published, in order to ask for interference from another country in the US election in 2020, including his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, Wolodymyr Selenskyj, in the summer: Trump told him to launch investigations into his possible democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, in Ukraine.
As the New York Times reports, whistleblowers are yet another analyst of the CIA ’ s foreign intelligence service.

Suddenly hiring: WeWork lets real estate markets tremble.
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office rental company.
In just a few years, WeWork is rising from a small start-up to the most expensive real-estate markets in the world, but now the company is in crisis, and landlords have to fear for billions of dollars.
WeWork ’ s office renter crisis threatens to disrupt the balance in the world ’ s largest real estate markets, which, just a few days ago, founder Adam Neumann deferred the planned stock market performance and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for executives to gain financial room for the coming weeks and months, as well as reporting, among other things, the British Financial Times, WeWork has stopped the closure of new leases with immediate effect, thereby,, among other things, the largest leain in New York and London.
WeWork rents large office spaces in the long term and rents them to members in small units in the short term, which can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded rental contracts with maturities of up to 15 years, with commitments of more than $40 billion, which could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real-estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented nearly 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the world ’ s most expensive real-estate markets, in the past 24 months. WeWorks ’ new contracts meant that demand for offices in New York was greater than the new areas that had been marketed at that time, and WeWorks Expansion would have in in in in the US metropolis at this time, as Alpwrote in Business in in London, in in in in in in in in.,,,,,,,,,,
In the UK, too, the equilibrium in the real-estate market could be felt without further expansion of the aggressive start-up, including WeWork ’ s main landlord, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis purchased last year by the Savings Bank Fund provider Deka for almost €100 million.
WeWork is the only real estate agency in the world to offer property for sale.
Russia once again saw numerous North Korean fishermen.
The Russian Coastguard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen, and over the last few days a total of 262 poachers caught illegally in the waters, according to the Interfax Agency ’ s domestic secret service, the Russian National Intelligence Agency, said on Friday.
It was only ten days ago that 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea, and the border guards had been fired and three of them were injured, and this time there were no injured, and the Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the Russian coast guard, according to their own data, is patroling their marine biological resources, with 30,000 octopus fish being discovered in the new controls, and claims have been confiscated to three fishing boats and two motor boats and brought to Vladivostok after the disaster and Posjet.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs, with thousands of North Korean fishermen being temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Enterprises in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently complained about high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who fished in Russian-banned narrow-meshed synthetic nets, which would also take small creatures out of the sea, and would simply dispose of nets in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be dismantled, and ships themselves would not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
On September 17, Russian border guards first established a North Korean boat and then a second one after the fire opened.
The US imposed an exit ban on ex-President Castro
The United States imposed restrictions on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children on entry bans, and the US Foreign Minister, in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in 'gross violations of human rights', stated that, as head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean, he was standing before a system in which thousands of Cubans were arbitrarily arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As Chairman of the Armed Forces, Fidel Castro's brother of the death leader, Nicolás Maduro, is also complicit in human rights violations there. "The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former regime of Maduro are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," twittered American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump spoke out against members of the Venezuelan Government and the military; in Venezuela, a fierce power struggle has been raging for months between the government and the opposition; the US has imposed a whole range of sanctions on Maduro ’ s government to bring him to his knees and bring him to power with the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president, Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is considered to be one of Maduro ’ s closest allies, and Venezuela ’ s socialist Caribbean island receives oil in exchange for the services of posted doctors.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the world ’ s largest climate protests, thousands of people today want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
The Fridays for Future movement plans to take action again and rallies in dozens of countries around the world, beginning with New Zealand and Australia ’ s shifting of time before the protests across Europe to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunrg wanted to take part in a major rally in Canadian Montreal, and protesbefore in Washington.
Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, more than four million people went to the climate, and this Friday we do it again!", she wrote on Twitter.
A good third of the world's demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had been involved in the protests, according to estimates by Fridays for Future in 575 German cities.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on its country ’ s leaders to make greater efforts to protect the climate, and the Fridays-for-Futur movement emerged in a short space of time, with students and students participating in climate protests, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition in the fight against global warming and the impending climate catastrophe, especially if global warming is to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees in comparison with pre-industrial times, in accordance with the Paris climate agreement.
Thunberg arrived in New York just under a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic tour, where she recently attended United Nations climate protests and summits, and on Monday she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke to the world ’ s leaders as a matter of urgency.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia must no longer smoke on the balcony in the future, and this is a change in fire protection. 'This also applies to smoking', a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency said in Moscow on Thursday, according to the Agency Tass, that the ban is to enter into force on 1 October.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If the cigarette is fired, then the penalty will be higher, and the ban will mean that the same burning candles will be imposed on the ministry.
Schlag gegen Cyberkriminelle - Ermittler heben Server aus aus.
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time removed a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites in a former Nato-Bunker in Traben-Trarbach at Mosel, via the internationally active criminals.
On Thursday evening, seven suspects were arrested for a major action, and Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects should have been, among other things, the operators of the world's second largest drug-market place, "Wall Street Market", who had been investigators crushing in the spring, and the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a cyber bunker server, according to the prosecutor's office.
Such a host was first lifted out in Germany, and a webhoster provides infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the course of the access session with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and neighbouring countries, resulting in almost five years of investigation, and at midday the investigators want to find out more details.
New Global Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people today want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement planned new actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.,,,,,,, and, the, the “,,,,.,,, the
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller towns and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland in Sylt.
Climate protests  Who are Thunbergs Hintermänner?
It is all the more surprising that in a world full of war and smoke factories, a 16-year-old girl is keeping the mirror in the nose, but what is behind it?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses on the move and brings young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world; historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has created a collection of children and young people. In 1212, a child named Nikolaus Cologne felt to work for a more just world, when,, Gre, he has a young man to win for himself and cross the sea to get to the country, just as Th, recently made a trip to America sailing.
In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side, and her mother has published a book that has sold itself extensively, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight.
This is where the ghosts divorce: Is it morally right to enrich the world financially when rescuing it? Is it still authentic when certain circles of people work together with stock exchange brokers during the world rescue action?
Comet discovered: Interstellarer Guest crosses through our solar system.
A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: a strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time, researchers have only suspected it, but now they are certain: a comet crossed by another star at the moment, he was baptized after his discoverer 2I / Borisov and is currently busy astronomers around the world.
2I / Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea.
This body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow in Crimea, who looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observation confirmed his first suspicion.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain a close insight into a strange solar system.
Comet was already sighted before arrival - and can be observed several months.
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in detail, because, unlike his predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been spotted in his instinct, which means that he can be investigated for many months from Earth. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and be visible by April 2020 with medium sized telescopes", says Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
Initial findings on Comet 2I / Borisov raise scientific hopes.
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter, and at the same time the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of silence is similar to ours.
The observation goes beyond individual knowledge, however, that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years, may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids keep on employing researchers, and recently a giant asteroid rushed past the planet and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson exposes himself to brother.
Boris Johnson, a younger brother, is going to leave the cabinet, and now his sister, in clear terms, is going to leave the Prime's belligerent language as' tasteless', not the brother she knows.
"Capitalisation", "Fraud", "Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is continuing to equip himself - at least verbally - at Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this aroused massive opposition outrage, and more critics have now spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The famous journalist and author said to Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were hanging, dragged, tormented, tormented, and tormented. They consider this to be highly reprehensible, and they do not see the version of their brother again, said Rachel Johnsons, who was in the EU elections for the anti-Brexit party Change UK.
In particular, she stated that her brother, Jo Cox, had ordered an EU-friendly underhouse deputy murdered by a neo-Nazi just a few days before the 2016 exit referendum, who could best be honoured by pulling through Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons. 'It is very tasteless to refer to a Member murdered by someone who called' Britain first ', now criticized Johnson's sister, who was apparently from the far right camp,' reinforced by this kind of language ', which she feels very distrusted to taste.
He also criticized the Prime Minister's widow, "It makes me ill when Jo's name is used in this way," he twittered. "The best way to honor them is to be and resolutely committed to what one believes to, but never to" demonize "the other, complaining that an atmosphere was created in which attacks were more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory MP. "I have been torn apart between loyalty to the family and the national interest in recent months - it is an intractable tension," explained Jo Johnson.
As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "this country is not worthy".
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez will perform at the Super Bowl.
The NFL is a strong sign in the year of its 100-year existence: two women with Latino roots are appearing in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, promising an explosion of fun and energy.
Latina-Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the upcoming finals of the US Football League NFL, which was announced on Thursday.
"I feel unbelievably honoured and humiliated to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, who has an incredible strength in the USA," said Shakira in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will be celebrating its 100th birthday next year, will be held in Miami on February 2.
"I love the Super Bowl this time putting two women on stage - and two Latinas," explained Lopez, sending an important message to all Americans and the world, promising an explosion of fun and energy for the show.
She was born in New York, where her parents were emigrated from Puerto Rico.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer.
The announcement of mid-term passengers is eagerly awaited every time in the US, and many this year view the choice as a political gesture, not least through President Donald Trump ’ s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sporting event and also a gigantic advertising spectacle.
Last year, political controversy arose in the run-up to the quarterback of Colin Kaepernick, who, in protest against police violence against black people, refused to stand up when the national anthem was played, and for which, among other things, US President Donald Trump had strongly approached it.
An actor and Youtuber places Egypt ’ s ruler: For the time being, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether blood is again flowing on the streets of Egypt, both spent last week abroad, one of them floated back at Cairo airport on Friday, and President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly.
Mohamed Ali remained abroad, of course, where he escaped the security forces that would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil.
He goes directly to the head of state and in a very rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is hovering in luxury and can build sumptuous new palaces, the army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule is blaming Ali for corruption and enrichment.
Last week, after Sisi ’ s grip on power demonstrated thousands against his rule, and nearly 2000 citizens, including prominent figures from civil society, human rights lawyers, and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a “million-march ” for this Friday, with so many people really daring to go to the streets, but there were some minor protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo, and in Kina near Luxor, videos in social media showing protests that Al Sisi was accused of corruption and his demise.
In the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators shot banners with the President's portrait, massive police presence was reported on Friday, security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the exit roads, several underground stations in the city center were closed for "maintenance work", most roads around Tahrirplatz, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked, and in the Rabaa Square, where supporters of the ousted Mursi protested until the army took fire and killed 800 people, and another one was to prevent Sisis from meeting here: one of Sisi's great parties wanted to hold a meeting for the President of the future.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrirplatz," said Ali in Barcelona, in his video camera. "Let us with police",,: "Egypt is.
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than the provider advertises, there are different testing possibilities.
If you sign up to an Internet contract, you don't need to blindly trust the vendor ’ s speed data; customers can check for how much of it is actually achieved when it comes to performance.
After all, the previously promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre Bavaria.
If the connection is always much slower than the provider advertises, there are different testing possibilities, so the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests carried out by the providers are carried out according to bidder specific specifications and are therefore not calculated in a uniform and objective manner", states the Consumer Centres Bavaria on their side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can usually set a reasonable period of 14 days to produce the promised service, and the best thing they can do is to write to the provider in writing.
If this does not work after several requests, customers can cancel and claim damages under certain circumstances.
First Senior Republicans for Investigation
As the first senior Republican, Vermont Governor has declared himself in favour of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it leads from here, the facts are determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday,,,,,,,, before measures to the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukraine ’ s President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching “for years. ”
Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the whistleblower-affair; few have shown unease about it; Scott ’ s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules.

But what about the sudden good news?
Herzogin Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" film.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the big finals in the United States, with a lot of Happy Ends and a lot of cameo appearances in the last episode, as well as the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked in the series for many years, was charmed in a charming way.

But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the "Suits" film in passing, of course in a wedding scene.

Aegean: Baby and four other children drown at boat luck.
In the case of a refugee boat in the Aegean, a baby and four more children died, with seven people killed in the accident, as the Greek coastguard said on Friday, and the nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, located between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland.
At the moment, hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, and last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed, and German Minister of the,,,, announced that both countries had any. the,, the are.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wants to inform himself in Turkey about the refugee situation, "said Seehofer on Friday, and then in Athens he wants to learn more about the" administrative problems of the Greeks "in order to help overcome them.
On Friday, a spokesman at the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip to Seehofer with EU Home Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France ’ s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, unusually many migrants continue to come from Turkey; on Tuesday alone, 654 people were transferred to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkei deal still work?
The increased numbers have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016, suggesting that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come illegally from Turkey to the Greek islands, in exchange for the EU ’ s intention to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every displaced Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only progressing with difficulty due to a lack of personnel on the Greek side, and Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, have nearly 29 400 people, the worst of which is the situation in Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently housed in a capacity camp for 650 people.
Never before since the entry into force of the EU Turkey refugee pact in March 2016 have it been so many, reported state broadcasting.

Green politician must answer for embarrassing photo pants.
The head of the Canadian Green Party, Elizabeth May, during the election campaign, was manipulated for this reason by the Becher?
The Canadian Green boss holds a multi-way bribe in his hand on a photo, but now came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally fell asleep, and Elizabeth May, the leader of the Canadian Green Party, never kept her hand in hand on the party's website to see her in a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens.
Green boss must be responsible for Fotopanne ’ s activities.
As a result, the National Post accused May of manipulating, and the fake news party made it more credible to appear on the subject of "environmental protection", in the midst of an election campaign for the House of Commons, in which Trudeau has become increasingly difficult because of a bribery scandal.
The photograph went virally in the social media and threw up the discussion about fake news.
May was shocked and told on her blog that she didn ’ t know anything about this action, and in order to underline this, she immediately postulated the original: she, talking to citizens, put a cup in her hand, but she did so correctly, whether from Bambus.
May writes that she is suffering for the employee who has done so. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardianund and at the same time asks herself something of her over-committed team: "If they want to work again, they could not do what with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also fallen into shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel, but their pictures were not fancy.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was promised an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in she was not allowed to fly on board - and she was never allowed to fly again with Cathay.
There is also an upgrade for Business Class - many of them dream of passengers, and sometimes they are lucky, and the check-in staff offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how you should not do it: A self-declared influenza has actively asked Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade, followed by Jaqueover 65,,,,, from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jaqueline was the only airline in the world to be able to offer its customers the best service in the world.
Jaqueline was also a member of the JFK team, and was also a member of the JFK team.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaquelines Ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific.
In her case, Influencerin turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: Cathay has committed the influenza virus fraud, it remains closed for future flights, and the airline ’ s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay the new flight.
Oil prices according to the report on the ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the Friday lunchtime, with a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea resorts of Brent 61.83 US dollars – roughly 1.4% less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3% to $55.77.
A Wall Street Journals report on a ceasefire in Yemen triggered the price slide, with Saudi Arabia agreeing to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil installations in mid-September brought down five per cent of global oil production, with Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war of Yemen clashing for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran, for defusing political tension in the region.
If agreement is reached, growth and demand can be concentrated, Ole Hansen, head of Saxo Bank ’ s Commodity Strategy department at the news agency Bloomberg, said.
The price of oil is thus continuing its downward movement of the past few days, with a barrel of WTI oil still costing almost $59 a week, Brent nearly $65.
Last but not least, after the attack in mid-September, Bloomberg reported to Insider that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia proceeded faster than expected, with output reaching a volume of eight million bara per day,,,,.
Last but not least, there have been several press releases calling for insiders to report on the rapid progress of Saudi Aramco, the Saudi oil company, in repairs, but commodity experts point out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock exchange and is trying to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker '' Ste' is after by Iran and the recent release on the way to; the crew is to, while the ship continues, the Prime Minister, Erik Hånell, told Swedish broadcasting on Friday morning in an SMS message.
But the US announced that it would move defensive missiles and soldiers to Iran ’ s arch-enemy to Saudi Arabia, with fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom temporarily pushing up oil prices.
Proposals against Trump are intensi.
In the case of possible abuses of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up charges against the White House have been raised, with several leading government officials working hard to prevent access to the conversation after a contentious telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, declaring an anonymous signer.
North Korea ’ s third summit with Trump and Kim is questionable.
North Korea has raised doubts that there will soon be a third summit of leaders, Kim Jong-un, and US President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first Singapore summit, says top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The US would not have done anything to implement the summit ’ s decisions last year, said North Korean State Department adviser, who also criticized intensified US sanctions and joint US and South Korean military exercises, but he hopes for a “wise ” and“ bold ” Trump ’ s decision to return to rapprochement.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit should bring with him before he agreed to do so; the negotiations on disarmament of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February; and in June, they met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states, agreeing to relaunch the talks, but without great success..

Pound Pressure - Interest Reduction
British Pound under Pressure
In the face of an early cut in interest rates, the pound loses value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculated on a swift interest rate cut from the Bank of England (BoE) to the pound Sterling, and the British currency blended by up to 0.4% on Friday to $1.2269.
The result of the sales was statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who called for an interest-rate cut, even if chaotic Brexit could be averted, because uncertainty will affect the British economy in the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, because Saunders, as a defender of a restrictive monetary policy, told Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy caused by the Brexit hickhack, without directly signaling a cut in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to leave the EU without a divorce agreement, if necessary.
More, with his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Kerstin Leitel, a trade editor.
Doping: Further Russian Manipulations
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, the one-time director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's head of the World athletics Association.
In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), and it turned out that they were falsified.
In December 2014, the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) had been banned for three years, during which time Russian athletes were not entirely banned from the world stage.
There are no positive findings.
In the following September, the Wada raised the Rusada Bann again, but called for access to the laboratory and the samples in question, and the data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases, helping athletes and athletes to.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Light athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that doping data from the Moscow Analyst Laboratory have been manipulated. "Yes, we received the data nine months ago, we should check whether the task task force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday.
The World Cup
This confirms the IAAF ’ s position: The athletic association is the only organisation to hold its bans on Russia, with 30 Russian athletes flying neutral flags at Doha, demonstrating that they are training and testing outside the Russian system.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put manipulation in the room and asked Russia to respond within three weeks to the allegations, and Russia is now threatening to ban Rusada again and, in the worst case, to ban the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
