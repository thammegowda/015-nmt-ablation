Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city.
An irritation where young people are to meet today.
A Gruftkapelle, now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories for days.
It is nervous if maps are not up to date.
Everyone knows this, who had to get excited because the Auto-Navi instead of a bypass a green meadow.
The historic maps of the Bayern-Atlas digital map, an offer of the Bavarian State Government's Geoportals, are far from current, but very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the nineteenth century in the Munich area of crime.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork I do not recognize as such.
In the large overview map, more detailed maps for towns and municipalities, so-called "Urpositionsblätter", were added.
This was the result of the Bavarian survey between 1810 and 1864 and was the first measurement of Bayerns.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bayerns - naturally for military purposes.
Even though the French troops had finally departed from Lunéville from February 9, 1801, today ’ s neighbors, who created the idea of a universal Bayern-card.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the "Topographische Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian survey management.
The Munich Urpositionsblatt dates back to 1856 and is available on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek website.
The comparison between the former and today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.
Sendling was born 21 years after drawing up the map, 1877, when Münchner borrowed district.
Today, Untersendling is located in the heart of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, there is nothing to be seen as fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered curtains from the so-called "primeval photo", from which the base tax was derived.
Small plots are no longer proving farmers there, but rather small gardeners of the land in the sun.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar there is an historical map of the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you read in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with madness.
In 1858 / 59 the Munich-Kreis-Irrenanstalt was created at the Auer Lüften.
In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - of the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the anchor of the so-called wrong.
In addition, he has prohibited staff from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked on an exhibition with the Anstalt.
For 280 patients was first place, later on 500 places was expanded.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training enterprises.
West lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich Ost, east residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the Casa Don Bosco children's house was erected - architectural on the basis of the origins of the irritation that was destroyed in World War II during bombing.
The Marienplatz square was named "Haupt Platz" in 1856 and the Kaufinger street was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought the Second World War to the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 took many holes in the city centre.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn line tammstrecke took place.
With the slider, the old Munich Card can be compared to the aerial image of today - and the hole at the Marienhof fill up.
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association to promote color has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri on account of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and missionaries to pay special attention to journeys through the state, and to exercise extreme caution, as a series of questionable, race-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the state and are noted here," it says in the opinion of the group.
A recently passed law by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination actions, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state, which aim disproportionately at minorities, has led the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
"You have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are beaten or killed because of their skin colour, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US.
The group cited incidents like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline during the journey by the state and was taken by the police of Missouri in custody, without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that black drivers in the state are more often than whites in 75%.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be willing to bring in bail money or let relatives know that they travel through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassverbrechens-Berichtsprogramm des FBI, which classifies the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.
Travel warnings are also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after states adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigrant offences, which, in the view of ACLU, will contribute to further race profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary.
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac gave a picture on the spot.
In the case of the rights grabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverbands met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members.
Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his farm, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, so Swendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also the chairman of BLHV of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaunprojekt a "elementary important".
I cannot be profitable on such steep areas.
The green land for a lot of work, much has to be done with the engine sense.
"We are fighting here with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a bio plant.
For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "The Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunprojekts and is glad about the Leader promotion".
In the case of costs of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare, farmers should be supported.
It is hoped that this could lead to the reforestation of land being dragged out for a long time.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue to run them," stressed the mayor.
Farmers are often criticised for promoting this.
In 2013, more than 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in the Weidezaunförderung.
The open area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be researched until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded by Leader, a quarter contributed the municipality Fischerbach.
Thus, farmers love EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of wheat.
"The great advantage is the longevity of fences", explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "Your job is a good one, without farmers and rural women it is not".
Also for Peter Weiß stood firmly: "Here are the best food produced".
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state funding of fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite for this is the existence of a conveyor system designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be manageable (over 35% of slogans) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence is currently under way.
The area of conservation is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now Trump ’ s White House is embracing the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking statues.
Americans value them as much as any others, so Saddam Hussein ’ s carefully staged fall on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he saw a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the statue of freedom.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty-beekeepers would have borrowed him if he had done so.
But he attacked their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base.
As Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the statue of freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original statue of liberty. "
Miller is right, but, as he himself put it, it is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tiredness, your poor, / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the elving waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time in which the "elende waste" was better on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US.
This conflict, because of the importance of statue, is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict of significance for America.
Lazarus - and their friends who campaigned to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn classic depiction.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this back a long time ago.
The great horror of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the statue of freedom was not a welcoming one, but rather an early neo-conservatist one that killed the American flame into the world: Lady Liberty is moving forward..
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not intended to enlighten the way into the United States. '
Ziemlich ungewöhnlich ist Limbaugh hier auf etwas gestoßen.
The importance of statue is absolutely a matter of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is, in the truest sense, a question of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives..
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and will that they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump want to recognize.
Their torch is not to enlighten the way, but to the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the British team.
The UK ’ s Director of Light athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will contribute massively to the team in the World Cup.
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that the United Kingdom's athletics must learn from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," said Black.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. '
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who are going to compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredibly ', says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they were living or training, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great.
The Commonwealth silver medal winners, who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400-m hurdles, say that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland ’ s best overall athlete in the World Cup was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The midrange runner Muir is on this road and has set five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot who was to be watched for a great season that won the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only Scot in the team Lee McConnell was.
The team capitals say that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots belong not only to the team, but also in some cases to the medals and to the finals.
"The special thing about being a team member is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me to make it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums.
With regard to my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think it went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a World Cup home.
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there. '
Blocking critics about Facebook: Don ’ t grab a public office if you can ’ t stand up to voters ’ objections.
The father of our country knew something of a bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for newspapers to swallow him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He sent criticism, certainly.
But he has not silenced his critics.
In 1783, Washington said: 'Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we are being led like sheep to slaughter'.
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week.
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?".
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it is important.
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hit head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and play his haarless head to chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come on the side of the governor - a public forum officially referred to as official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking comments is nothing more than moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swim online the whip.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserfüllt, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary of the news program "The Post".
"I do not appreciate this idea, even if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are disregarded by some rather than as a so-called collective use and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected."
What the staff of the governor called the "concentrated spam attack" would probably call other "advocacy".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it was in the past, had the same thing been done, that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest demonstrators and silence them.
But that is what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she appointed a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters swallow for his leadership.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous troll.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers that laid down Washington's decisions.
Petitions that overwhelmed his position on the Amity Treaty, trade, and shipping with Britain, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse form the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to accumulate comfort in the Renaissance Club Club.
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be held in the next three days at home comfort, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Ireland, which led to the final round in the Archerfield links last year before losing Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he reached with this event his fame," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry has done a great job as he set this place.
He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. '
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, even though he won in his 32-year career both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour.
"This really feels particularly", said the player resident in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate. '
Gary Orr, who returned to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to action on homeland.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more if you play home", said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I am glad about how it has gone. '
With the trio in the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James, and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field that others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking costs £5 per car with an occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking.
This is the result of a study by the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 cases of lung cancer per year are due to passive smoking," said study manager Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Household connections prove to be very complex
The building works in the Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are somewhat in the time", so the head of the Bauhofs Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as there is much hidden in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which is constantly obstructing the construction works, poses a major problem for the construction of the Stumpp company.
"The ignorance of the drivers before red lights and barrier bars is already enormous", says Heinze.
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp company have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were pretty exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Golden Country
If Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use herd.
It rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai economy in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife normally lays a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the glued node will be taken with ice, unwashed hands and closed.
Degei sits on the mud - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example clothes with trübem water from the nearby swamp to wash.
A bucket in a rootless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, her fields were not assigned.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most village men are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around after 5 pm," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into the daily life of the Papua highlands, a former Dutch colony, which was accepted in Indonesia after a controversial referendum in 1969, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand survey before the occupying forces.
An existing movement that boasted for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which controls the region, excluding foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is.
There is no public transport.
The city, with some 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated roofs converted by rust into various yellow brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, revered Mee Pago Papuans a god named Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We were not accustomed to wearing these clothes," says Degei and hints at her lively, handwoven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"Previously we had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has cut $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
Moreover, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
But these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a stifling presence.
An investigation in the New York Times in 2005 reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units from 1998 to 2004 almost $20 million, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gangs and are mercilessly treated.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua ’ s tribal ochland in the 1970 ’ s were genocide in accordance with the Asia-Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything," it says in a 2016 report by Erzdiözese Brisbane, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electro-strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because every week incidents happen", says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified, as Papua ’ s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warden cranes sell fried chicken and gado, a mixed vegetables with Erdnusssauce served.
Local people are fighting to keep up here.
"Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who went to work in the provincial capital Jayapura.
"It has bought the indigenous Papua - the Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi in the People's Guard, promised to address inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua has changed little, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, Paniai suffered only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness.
The shot children told them that they should turn their headlights on.
One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and came later with four soldiers back, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk, hunted and swallowed up the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then a soldier fired in the group of children.
A child who was 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commander center to demand justice.
They helped to dismantle hunting grounds and led the Waita dance - in circles continuously and a bird singing imitating - by Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldier was sent a command over an internal spark: "If the masses do more than three times resistance, they shoot them dead", it is said in an official document of TIME that the local media was not released.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for calm and called the crowd back home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful old wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and studied his body to go safely that he was", said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only bears a name that TIME in gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I knew him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers wanted to secure their station only "because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It is about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings came only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historic ills in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and in the early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements, but there are processes that must go through ', he said.
Then made Wiranto a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, 'everything is regulated by law', he said.
Wiranto, accused of "crimes against humanity" by the UN, who called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been committed in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with grim disbelief.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that he still lives in fear years later.
"I am afraid," he says.
"I am afraid to be arrested by the military, I am afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"Having buried the corpses, the military sought me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to hospital, a person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man who was 24 years old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
The villagers protested before the company ’ s location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing hot shots.
But locals say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot on the crowd and killed one.
"We were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge", says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, so the TIME.
"I hid myself in my house two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for withdrawing the police ’ mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of tribal Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many closed themselves to the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained under the pretext of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua is Paniai known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is equally out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: above all, nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women who can work on four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They retain most of the crop for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nabire have grown.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own companies competitive.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because here there are no jobs or money", says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, even though they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Asia ’ s deputy director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new threats to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Mangeling press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the 'various and widespread violations' in Papua, including the Paniai Foundry.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group's allegations and said journalists in Jakarta: 'In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases'.
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, brazen locals covered their silence and afflicted him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but want to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai committees," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he must pay back.
"They do not need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the Paniai victims ’ families led a last symbolic act of defiance: the corpses of a victim were buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with his head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the Torch skyscraper from Dubai for the second time.
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai his diary and forced hundreds of residents fleeing the 337 meters high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire, which in just two years is swept through the high-rise house, which is named accidentally the Torch-Tower (Fackel-Turm).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and the cries of the people.
We ran the stairs down and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor down, "told a resident who called his name as George angab, Reuters.
Dubais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4,00 clock local time (00.00 clock GMT) triggered the fire and cool the building.
The government said it is working on providing shelter to those affected.
The incident can be used to raise questions about the safety of materials used in areas outside of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage was caused by the lining, the outer lining for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, the police said that they believe that the system of panels to isolate and cover London ’ s Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis-Cup-Reform: Continue Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has passed through his great Davis-Cup-Coup at the General Assembly. the. the the. the the. the of the. the
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority, but by Davis-Cup-Einzel to play only two wins.
These are often very long, but also very esteemed, five-tier classics remain the traditional competition.
63.54% of member countries voted in favour of reform, so the goal of the ITF president, David Haggerty, was thus scarcely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, "said Haggerty.
We will continue to work to improve the evaluation.
After many objections, Gar did not come to the vote before the proposal to remove the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018, only comparatively smaller details are available: the finalists in the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup will be in the next round of the host right in the next year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, the requirements in terms of training places and so on will be facilitated and the players will have to complete the official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings banned items to the plane, finds a survey out.
A survey conducted by air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously banned items are past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent, which affected the aircraft, while accidentally banned knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1% claimed that they were late discovered that they were mistaken for firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey conducted by Jet-Charterservice, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., in more than 1,000 people, found that younger travellers were more abusing the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by TSA, 19.7% were Millennium, compared to less than 15% that were members of the X generation.
The most common items that were hand in hand to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% said that they had knowingly carried items with blades through security control, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately put banned drugs on the plane.
The company said that it consulted travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods would have been transported by airport security and how many would have deliberately done so.
It is no surprise that the people who carry the smugglest goods - knowingly or unwittingly - by the safety of those who most frequently fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they may take with them or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of items confiscated by TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order order.
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
In doing so, he has hitherto suggested that a part of the customer has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the constantly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk, for the first time in the announcement of the recent quarterly balance sheet, has betrayed a different, less glossy figure: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often ordered more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months, whose delivery is just beginning.
Well, Musk concedes that a total of 518.000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK £1000) "Reservation Payment" in full.
Currently, 455,000 such non-committal reservations, Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts.
The fact that the cancellation of around 12% of all orders to date could become a problem, however, does not believe the Tesla boss.
His argument: the challenge to ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but in production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 - all models should be combined - 500,000, 2020 a million.
Demand for this is obvious.
There are currently 1800 reservations per day according to Musk.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can count on delivery at the latest in the second half of the year 2018 - if Tesla manages to maximise your current usage without major interruptions in the practice of tested production lines.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are too much delays, the inconvenience of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
After all, the company cannot prevent discontented customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt is withdrawing from emissions reductions because of the slowdown in Obama-Era rules.
A day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era ’ s rules to reduce emissions of smog causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when its agency responded to the needs of state environmental authorities more quickly than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint that had been lodged against his previous post in a federal court of appeal.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who had been a staunch opponent of stricter environmental legislation long before his appointment by President Donald Trump ’ s prosecutor in Oklahoma.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone to block or delay regulations that defy the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industries.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that imposed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his about-face in Ozonstandard was simply the willingness of the EPO to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation, and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," Pruitt, who accused the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in judicial regulation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that we have. '
However, the EPA's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use its "power to delay and make full use of all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "are based on a sound policy and the best available information".
Congressional Republicans insist on a broader recast of ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure was not put to the vote in the Senate yet.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for vulnerable groups, and each year can contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered about Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it needs to keep this reasonable step from those responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade, pollute itself and its special interests."
Tumlingen is celebrating 750 years of St. Hilarius Church.
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm is invited to a serenade.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius complex a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth Benefizer Trail can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The conservation and conservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and conveyors of Tumling their concern.
Walter Martini emphasises: "It is a unique dörfliches gem".
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergisches Urkundenbuch urkundlich: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen samt the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
The text of the document according to stand on the Tumlinger mountain, apart from the former parish church, was also a ruling court, which belonged to the church or the patronage law and not vice versa.
So people lived there too.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt in 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the ruling settlement centre of the village.
Old maps from the period around the year 1600 underpin these historical realities.
The patronage law originated from the early medieval church law.
A Lord, who built a church, provided and occupied with a parish, remained owners of this church and could inherit this church.
In this way, the right to appoint a parish or to propose a new parish to the bishop.
Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower.
The largest of the two crushed at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired Glocke was first crowned in 1692, but had to be left in 1942 later in World War II.
In the Thirty Years War (1616 to 1648) the windows were shot and the bells stolen.
The roof was closed.
In 1796, French troops relocated near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead of hearing boars.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilarius was abandoned.
Only the Kirchturm was left to stand.
In the New Year's eight 1834, a storm split the Kirchturm and the half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken.
Only the Turmzwerg, which still exists today, remained a witness to the 750 years of ancient church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cultivate the "Schaffigen Rentnern" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.
As organizer, the friends and conveyors of Tumlingens invite you on Sunday, July 16th to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.
This is done by Combo des Kepler-Gymnasiums Freudenstadt and by wordings by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The final word is preached by Hartmut Romann.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Decree is available from 3.30 p.m.
A trunk takes place in front of the graveyard for the proclamation of the Serenade.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope to receive many supporters of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and conveyors of Tumling feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade-Organisator Walter Martini reaffirms.
The Association wants to have windmills approved.
"Boisheim defends itself" does not see a legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It is illegal.
The association argues that, at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, because, at the time, only a quarter of the city ’ s border with Schwalmtal had a wind force concentration zone.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone results in the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent "sealing" the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days before, but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of a planned legal requirement, the granted authorization certificate remains unlawful and therefore to withdraw", said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim wehrt sich".
Current state of affairs: The city council decided again before the summer recess the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This excludes legally the granting of permission for the construction of wind turbines."
The circle confirms the entrance of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received since last week in the district of Viersen," said a speaker.
The circle is taking the opportunity to look again at the matter.
However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.
With a view to ongoing procedures at the Administrative Court, the circle did not want to speak out in terms of the content of Thursday's arguments of the "Boisheim wehrt sich" association.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build a surface on the Boisheimer Nette on four four 200 meters high windmills.
Already last year, the company, in which the town of Viersen is indirectly involved, concluded leasing contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of large terrain.
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest some EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersens Stadtrat gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen and to the participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg County.
Auto and tractor crack together: woman dies in terrible accident
One terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were easily injured.
The highway remained closed for hours.
After police charges, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich, accompanied by her passenger car, accompanied her 53-year-old mother as a companion, took the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and traders are planning "home shopping" weekends
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to relax the inhabitants to the shopping mall in the city centre.
As the president of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "Homeland Shoots" weekend is intended to raise customers' awareness of what offers the city holds apart from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite you to "midnight shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the closer region.
In preparation are commercials in the radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, so Christian King.
Stadtverwaltung und Gewerbeverein cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
In this way, the Gewerbeverein and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Brunnenfest and sold soft Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be reopened or re-opened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
At the end of the day, everyone would have to contribute to revitalising the city centre, right up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
It lauded to overcome with a network the lethargy that had largely spread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, Head of the ICC Center in Mühlhausen announced that for the first time five Thuringian cities will participate in the nationwide third "home show" day.
Besides Bad Langensalza these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his or her immediate surroundings with his or her purchasing behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people have been injured.
A gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis killed two people and injured nine more, some of them severely.
According to the fire brigade, a injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
A man died when a part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A first misster was also dead later.
The dead were employees of the school.
The authorities suspected that the accident was due to a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
After leaked transcripts from telephone calls, Trump pressured Mexico for paying the border wall.
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President denounced him for publicly denouncing the wall, and reportedly he said to him: 'You cannot say this to the press'.
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the US ’ s southern border, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees emigrated to Australia, to take over "ridiculously", "mies" and "dumb", and that the existence of the trade that was mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a "depp" after proposing a ban on resettlement of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, "that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore ’ s Ford-Massacre: Activists reintroduce racist Lynchakt as a call for justice.
A 1948-er Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumped to the Ford Bridge from Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men appeared with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked at the windshield.
Drinks float into fear.
"We want this n --r Roger!" brushed the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Schreie torn the silence when a young black man was torn apart by the front-passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is only a rendition.
But if a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all in the audience would be very real sigh.
Since 2005, Moore's Ford Bridge civil rights activists have come back to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lauded by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been accused of murders.
"It is really incomprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are", said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in organizing the posterity.
"It is a jewelry on a story, but it is a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former member of Congress of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights activists.
It serves as a dramatic call for action and is an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must get justice," he said.
"We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A court medical officer puts a bed towel above the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore -Ford-Lynchens on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men were suspected of monroe and surrounding counties in the Lynch process.
But none has ever been indicted.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch's actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a ruling by the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer ’ s pre-election campaign.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI of the black peasant Roger Malcom, held a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a struggle, supposedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city had been that Hester slept with Malcoms Ms Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, the FBI said.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when she approached the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, Lynchmob moved the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders", concludes here a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and deferred the identity of witnesses.
Brooks worded it even more concise.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, then you will pass here. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual rendition of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.
Her portrayal is vivid, touching, and is rooted in a kind of deep racism, many of which want to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It is hard to see, and it is even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We do not want to talk about the Lynchen because we will then be confronted with its severity in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I've done."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and listened as Greene played a good overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not so", said Marbaugh.
"But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, the Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester play their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, the ghost and afflicts him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said n --- he, disappearing from my property!"
Rascona awakes the fire.
There is a pause.
And then each (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs laughing.
"What!", Rascona asked.
It is alarming and confused.
Was I too tough?
"No," Greene said, still kichernd.
"I simply do not believe that white people at that time called 'n --- er'.
"But", "one of the other black performers celebrated.
"You only have to hit the hard 'R.'.
And this is precisely where energy shifts in space, a feeling of comradeship replaces unease.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.

Max set works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their voluntary year.
Where everywhere?
Lots: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have already worked on the school in the open days.
How are your experiences?
Lots: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, young people, refugees, young adults.
They are now 26 years, that is, a future volunteer.
How does this happen?
Lot: I made Abitur.
And then a construction engineer ’ s study, we say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it is for me the wrong and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I wondered what you are doing.
Mach a social year, since there is a glimpse, since you can see how it is on site, in the focal point perhaps also, really is.
And was it so?
Lots: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social field in the winter semester.
I am going to study dual, probably in the Youth Welfare Office, and I am studying in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different sites during the voluntary service?
Lot: Yes, it is very variable.
It is always important to be where FSJ is.
It can be done from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, in other words in the afternoon care.
For me this was exactly the right thing to do.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Contrary to the construction studies?
Many: Well, here it is not a question of calculating statics.
Time and time again, people have turned their heads, each with a very different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a young person who has been taken from the family, must always be dealt with individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of touch?
Lots: I am not the type for this.
It is an area that gives a lot.
Much love, much kindness.
There are also sometimes negative moments, but so is life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive business.
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividend by 72%, as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company.
The job cuts, the Director-General John Fallon largely announced at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, are in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by £300 million ($394 million) in May in a third cost reduction program to revive a business that was taken by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged, having achieved an increase of 1% to £2.05 billion in the first six months.
Convoi attack by Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several other officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured, a declaration was made by Nato.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in Qarabagh ’ s incident.
The bombing is the last violence that struck Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
In a statement by Nato, the explosion on Thursday evening is said to have occurred when a joint patrol was attacked with the Afghan army by a "person's improvised vocabulary".
The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on Bagram's airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, some 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a chiefly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city ’ s center killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s most deadly militant attack, since the US led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump weighs down the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and especially in President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
EPA reverses the Smog Rule ’ s Delay
The US Environmental Protection Agency has postponed a decision to delay the Obama administration ’ s regulation that states are obliged to contain smog-inducing emissions, a day after 15 countries sued the agency for the step.
The EPA announced on Wednesday that it was late in announcing the decision to push ahead with the so-called 'ozone provisions 2015' and said that it is demonstrating the Agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners," said EPA-Chef Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPO ’ s intention to measure ozone regulations – in which emissions of pollutants are to be measured in part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards – by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to revive a broad range of environmental requirements that former President Barack Obama has imposed on him as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
But efforts have triggered the Democrats ’ backlash and nature conservation groups that worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that breathing air containing ozone can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.
Community space
At the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a Community space in the future senior citizens' residence.
Before the discussion there is an important piece of information: The purchase contract for the missing property is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
It is true that it will still take time for the area in the municipal council, which has so far belonged to the parish community, but there is now no planning barrier for a private investor to the stemmende project.
There is a discussion about a Community area for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to come to the community. the.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with a 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council pretends to see such a common space not as a meeting place only for the residents of the senior-just living, but openly into the community.
For example, the word "knickcafé" made the round.
The decision that was decided last autumn by allocating funds for the current budget will be offset by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a Community space would be, according to Tjaden, eligible for 60% of 30%.
The proposal for a decision aims to signal to the investor that in this respect, he does not want to throw a stick between the legs, the statement that both Sattel- and Pultdach - which is based on the environment construction, which would reduce the level of grapes and make the construction of economic power possible.
Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer says this addition.
If 's helps: unanimity happens to the body.
It is not as easy as the Community area.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings with which one cannot move forward, for which one is now opposed in the Community area from the window, she says: 'I am struggling with that'.
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against local participation.
It sees it as a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the purchase of the area does not give a grant, but rather gives a real countervalue, which is the counterclaim, which is clearly marketable.
Staiger ’ s request to split the proposal for a decision is supported by three.
In two votes against the original programme, Stefan Haller summarised it as follows: 'If we take the decision, we are taking a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure'.

Hiking from Stern in the Harz
In Harz, the "Star Path" is to be created throughout Germany.
This is what the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg is planning.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "Star Path" will meet the information needs of many Harzbesucher, it.
He combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to climb along the planned route table and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well attainable installations at five to six locations" in Oberharz.
Infrage kämen St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the table should be supplemented by Internet.
Therefore a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later the starship path Zug is to be extended.
"The star path shows the viewer a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
Moreover, they learned why stars have different colors, or why a star is stronger than another, even though it is much further away.
It also mediates in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating the highest situated observatory in Northern Germany since 2014 in St. Andreasberg.
The location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Frequently, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are visible with a naked eye.
In the Uni-Stadt there is something similar to the planned starry werg - the Planetenweg since 2003 on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen.
Beginning before Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetenweg takes its steles up to the Hainberg and the Sternwarte, as well as a "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steels with the individual planets - including the pluto at the end point degraded to the dwarf - are positioned precisely at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth is shrinking to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres.
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than light in space.
The march to the next fix star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate spaces in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, to Garcia, the unrivalled World Boxing Council lightweight Champion, the Flur went down to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federgewicht-Champion.
After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision on the former Four-Division World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for Pound-Liste.
Garcia stretched the right hand and said: "How is it going to you, champion?
I wish you good luck. '

As the couple for photos posierte, Lomachenko manager Egis climates noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I am a former feather weight," said Garcia.
"I grew up for bronze [on 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I am small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he must move towards lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That is what the fans demand.
Let us give them that. '
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxen needs this fight."
Climate asked if it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-Pfund-Debüt this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight match in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in Pay-per-View mode because all fans asked him", said Garcia and expressed himself later openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can generate this type of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may participate in his Saturday fight.

Four Wounded after Reifenplatzer
In the event of an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
After first information, the rider of an Opel Zafira lost his vehicle shortly before the closing of the market, probably after a tire car.
The Pkw dragged to the right into the Böschung, where it overflowed and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial provision of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked to the north for about an hour, and then the traffic on the left was forwarded to the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Dreierkette works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2: 2 for the season opening against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue points.
With the first season game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result, too, would not have been the two counterparts at 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two counterparts too much, and we need to be even more careful in Aue," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
The triangle is also to be further optimized in the Erzgebirge.
And a gateway to a free ride doesn't want to catch the fortunes any more.
"For the future, it will be that no longer stands beside Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope with the triangle even after the experience in the preparation, than with the.
"I do not yet know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we can build on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"Prerequisite, but that we harmonize even better and we do not make so many mistakes in building."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"Whether you can speak after an undecided start, you don't know.
The performance could well be okay, "Hoffmann said.
"If, however, we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a proper seasonal start."
His coach did not want to know anything about this.
"The start in the season I judge only after six to eight days of play," Friedhelm Funkel said, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be aborted prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a little more fresh because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorites in the bones.
"But they do not know so 100% where they are currently standing", says the indent of Fortuna.
It is true that the guests from the Rhineland meet in Aue at last (almost) in the final stages as a lighter favourite on Sunday.
"The fact that we are sweeping them away simply because we are entitled to come under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is very positive in only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which has to be beaten from the start," says Fortunas Chefcoach.
"Such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel doesn't want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of Sweden ’ s Asylum Age Testing
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of people tested are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are to make an assessment of the age during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration verket) was criticised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, migratory sales have sent 6,880 cases to test, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency estimated that the person "possibly 18 years or older" was.
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old".
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months.
"We do not see a big difference in statistics of recent months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that suggest that the person investigated was 18 years or older.
When the Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, where X-ray accuracy was made by Weisheitszähnen and MRT recordings of knee joints, which were then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether they used to go through puberty sooner or later.
"I had reason to think about this and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age to judge this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say it safely, we should not pretend that we could, "he said the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is incorrect.
The greatest risk lies in the fact that the person is under 18, in this case this is about 10%. '
Full of Plan
The works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.
On Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it runs super", says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Government Bureau of Freiburg.
In April, the works began at the same time on all three sanating bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the building is scheduled for October and there is no doubt that the timetable will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach..
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete, which has a red-colored stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come into existence for years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built from red brick.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 m wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap on the Wednesday morning on the north side.
This is a fringe attachment, which is also used as an operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge, a bridge of 2.20 meters is to be used on Friday.
That is what the pedestrian route is supposed to be.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of Schramberger Company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already covered with patented bridges.
Particular sensitivity has required the insertion of wires through the construction in Lauterbach.
There is also a glass fiber cable that is connected to many companies.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by hand papers.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by an ample.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully locked.
The cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000.
This is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is difficult to bring together is difficult.
The CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, left parties represented in the Volcanic Field Circle belong to a broad alliance that shows peacefully the flag this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the "big campaign" according to Plakat.
And known names at the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the federal election on September 24, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch.
But the hours before the event begins are on the spot, do not want to listen to the AfD students, but demonstrate.
The motto "Die Eifel bleibt bunt".
Originally the city picnic under the motto "All at a table" was planned on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place on the parking place below the Rondells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful image that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers, is right: "Toll, how many people have come together here".
There are music and lots of food, including a "urdeutscher Kartoffelsalat", which AfD could easily eat, "says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, they show presence above all at the station, which is only a few metres from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD volcano ice blade reported that he had made an effort to get such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for a cancellation in Daun, but because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
With a view to the Rondellvorplatz event he says: "This is the good right of people, main thing, it remains peaceful".
This is also the case: the Rondellvorplatz provides a band for entertainment in the Stadthalle, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chair Uwe Junge.
In the Chamber, some 200 listeners are waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch to deliver their speeches.
The police presence has changed, but so far officials have had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour, the AfD event, which guests have at their disposal a longer breath, but also there, is scheduled to take place shortly after 21 o'clock.
The police can move away - no special occurrences.
Poznan meets Trompet
A repeat with the Wolfacher Posaunisten Frederic Belli is taking place in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the slogan "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German training with roots in Blasmusik.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
So Petkov Solotrompeter is the soloist at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli, Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unite the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments, but also to merge the limits of the various genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach explores the world music in a new dress, Daniel Schnyders, with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by Jazzechopreisträger Nils Wogram, he mixes classic, jazz and free play to a fascinating piece of art.
This core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it for the two musicians and more: the Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything, "Kristen Stewart openly said about her bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think: 'Oh that was cool, what comes next?'.
The most famous relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually went into bitter trouble.

So I have never been confused or obstructed.
I never liked to be taken seriously. '
Especially suffered from it, according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurts me greatly.
When I was eleven, the children told me that I would look like a bub.
I really felt attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think: 'girl, be proud of you!'.
Especially the public does not like to explain to her love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and annoy me.
And perhaps some call me an ankable, but I do not like to have to justify myself to the general public. '
The West Virginia Governor announced that he would change the party.
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the democrats have moved away from me, "said Gouverneur Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans", added Justice.
"As a trainer I would say that it is time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he possesses coal mines in five states, and inherited a carbon-business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening saying, "Party change by Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working rather than make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and control of least-legislative entities in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from above to below without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," said the RNC chair Ronna McDaniel in a statement the CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian excuse for doping scandal
The world leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the moment for the country to be reinstated in sport.
Russia ’ s Leichtathletic leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship that banning his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said it gave him pity for "all athletes who were swallowed away in competitions gold and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe the reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognised itself that it experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation was redesigned."
Coe said he was also 'pleased' that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the deceased system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will start on Friday in London at the light athletics world championships, following the strict IAAF criteria as neutral players.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned coaches are still free to act, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Trauerakt für in Mali abgestürzte Soldaten
At a ceremony in Fritzlar, Northern Hesse, around 1000 people thought of the soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security precautions.
Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the still unexplained crash.
She referred to the two pilots who had been killed but as "Could their expert".
"We bow to this highest sacrifice that they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from Nordhessen were killed on Wednesday before a week in West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a total guard of the Bundeswehr in the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday.
At midday, only the members of the church took off.
After that the Trauerfeier began in the circle of the family, the closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and the politics.
Among them were Hessen ’ s prime minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Trauergäste laid roses, the families stood arm in arm at the coffins.
Before the church, Fritzlarer and many soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Secretary of Defense of the Leyen described the kidnapped soldiers as "highly decorated" and operational.
The Chief of Staff of Tiger ’ s Flight Operations in Fritzlar, Germany, was set up and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regime.
Volker Bauersach, commander of the regime, who owned the soldiers, said: "If this occupation could not avert the fall, there would have been no mockery."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali showed Minister Leyen: deployment is dangerous.
But it is also of great importance for a country from which we are separated only by two states, "she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken from the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife.
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried after his death next to his wife.
This divided the royal house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is set aside in the church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already completed a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agrees with the decision of her husband, it continued to be stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik was buried, is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be set aside in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik never made a secret that he was not happy with his title.
After the throne empowerment of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired, including the title "Prince Choice".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function in Denmark, he wanted to see himself not equal to his wife - not even after death, Lene Balleby explained, the chief spokesperson of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be set aside in his French homeland, but in Denmark..
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French aristocracy, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the subject in the French Embassy.
During his later wife's sympathies with the people, Prince Henrik had a serious stand at the Danes in his almost 50-year-old regency.
In a autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was pregnant, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which had the reputation to be the trademark of social critics of intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
These were just two mistakes! '
Prime Minister Weil wants a rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister, Stephan Weil (SPD), has resigned after the loss of the red-green government majority for a rapid re-election of the land day, but does not want to resign.
It was because on Friday Parliament was in favour of the resolution.
Previously, the surprising exit of a Green MEP from her country faction into the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) plunged into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country ’ s election, the Red Green coalition lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MEP Elke Twesten founded her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU", she said on Friday in Hanover.
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that they be included.
In doing so, CDU and FDP, together, would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected on January 14, next year.
Thümler said that the rot-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the day of the land should be resolved as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the Prime Minister will be deprived of confidence and a successor will be elected.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined legally clean, "said Thümler.
"It will be discussed calmly when they are legally sound."
Thümler called Twestens Schritt "doch etwas kurios".
The politician herself said: 'I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. '
She called herself an appendix to Schwarz-Grün.
The Greens called for the renegade MEPs to return their country's daily mandate.
"We assume, of course, that they will return their country mandate, which they have received via the green country list, with immediate effect," said the country ’ s presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance, Anja Piel, said: 'We regret the decision of Elke Twesten'.
You have deliberately chosen not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
"The behavior of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of Red Green," the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s decision to re-elect the country ’ s day quickly.
Leaving Twestens costs red green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "in her injured vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country", criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is scandalous that the CDU, in Lower Saxony, is taking advantage of this dirty intrigue and trying to capitalise on it".
Niedersachsens CDU-Fraktionschef Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his deputies that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU.
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, warned Twesten to falsify the outcome of the country ’ s election in 2013 with personal careers.
At the time, the CDU was the SPD ’ s strongest force, SPD, and Green had a thin majority of one vote in the country ’ s day.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves against poisoners, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and responding to the interview with the German editorial network (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge carefully and to check the stamp pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the German Federal States provide the latest information about the affected egg charts.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we know at the moment, health risks are virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs?
Food monitoring is a task for the federal states.
Despite this, my house has immediately opened itself up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the ruin of Germany became known.
All information and risk assessment is available to the consumer.
Trade, like manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are safe and healthy.
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded in the case of eggs, they are not transportable.
However, unstressed eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time, the companies are not to blame.
Seats production plants and consumers on the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production companies are not directly responsible.
On the contrary, they must expect economic damage because of alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there is too little control in the crop case.
Is it just wrong for staff, or even for coherent competence?
It was the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that there is a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to public prosecutors in the cases in which crimes can be committed that are crucial.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide a complete explanation.
Is there really a need for regular alarmism in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and safe food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is not used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The money that has been poured into the situation means that manufacturers, traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticides Fipronil in the behaviour of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are resolved quickly and without gaps.
Like the financial rules of football on Neymar ’ s move to Paris,
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditure on European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars ’ World Record Transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.
Somewhat consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the leading organisation that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair-Play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy out the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar underwrites it and puts it in a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy rich ruling family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must use legitimate revenue sources that enable them to break even in their soccer business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
Former French players believed that clubs that had made huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of clubs on monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential bought and then invested vigorously to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue.
During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.
And, while Platini fell from the presidency in disgrace in 2015, his successor, UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to discouraging excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, opposite The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the invoicing over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redeeming sum for the next five years can be expelled in the annual accounts of EUR 44.4 million.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought together the PSG with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members remain limited to 21 players for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season instead of the normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by blowing their revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments from the organizing committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors, and such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, posted on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16, with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymars to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and it tried to prevent Neymars from moving by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar last owner to PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"Once a country has a club, everything is possible.
It is going to be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay, because there are different ways or different interests, if a country has such a large player to represent a country. '
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggilieferant.
In recent years, Chocolat Frey Bord-Choade has produced chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is coming to an end: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small red-white enclosed shoggitafles to 14 grams per year distribute the cabin crew before landing to passengers.
The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros-Tochter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But, more importantly, the advertising effect is once and for all: for a shogger manufacturer, it is a prestigious contract.
How many applicants there are in the new tender, Swiss does not want to betray.
In question, however, only Swiss manufacturers come into question.
According to the newspaper, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the Treaty beyond spring 2018.
For sda the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate tables have been distributed on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class naschen Passagiere Schoggi of Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
The Swiss Schoggi is also distributed by Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class.
Lightweight athletics - Olympic champion Robert Harting reached World Cup final.
The three-time World Champion is fighting for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, failed in the national championship event and could only look at the discus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt qualified the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, the 65.13 meters far warf, for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" to the Nische.
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90's Grunge era (as the pioneer David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV turned), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to major things.
As a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a talking vegetable spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By playing on the core of Gag's hiding - middle-aged actors play horny children who are grown up - they managed to regain the impossibility of winning the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults, who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the Gießkanns principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that looks the cradle").
At one point, a character through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy malicious plot in which Ronald Reagan (including Mr. Showalter) is involved, now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the exam courses.
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who Matt Dillons underlip bart of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
These are the moments of random madness that could fuse this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even an "GLOW" with its East-West ring iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director gives an attached TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who are fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism.
The main roles - a hard saddled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt will be synchronized in English.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to the reputation (the police spend the time watching chess on television, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask, is involved - that it often plays like a single..
In six long episodes, the comedy is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which has been redirected to a lower length, could better deliver its agitprop genre, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything to feed a vow.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Beating Drug Mafia in the Land
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar circle, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, such as the public prosecutor's office Konstanz on Friday.
At the same time, 15 defendants were arrested between 25 years and 77 years of age and have already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials provided larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundreds of thousands of euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italians.
The two are likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
Overall, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and. the. the the the the. the of. the of,
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor ’ s office has been investigating the organized drug trafficking in the southern German region.
Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
That is why, on Wednesday morning, the deployment was also accompanied by four Palermo officials.
In particular, Ins Visier investigated Italian nationals with close links with the Italian mafia.
Also a incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired in the morning in a restaurant, should go to the account of the gang.
In this way, there are huge gaps in the EU ’ s foreign register.
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": according to a report, the German Foreign Register has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government ’ s representative for refugee management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the Foreign Affairs Centre register.
Defects in the data registered there could lead to serious misjudgments in asylum procedures and deportations, warnings in an analysis presented by the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the register, ten million people of foreign nationality are included, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been maintained sufficiently, data quality in parts has not been good up to now.
In individual cases, data was found in 1921, "by people who have long ceased to be alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register."
"Flawed data input can slow down return processes considerably," the report says.
In the statistics on people who are expatriate, they are covered by EU citizens who do not have to travel at all.
However, such false attributions led to a distorted debate on how to deal with travellers' volatile ', it is said, therefore, in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government seems to have begun sending refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children when they arrived there.
This is evident from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), which reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper says, therefore, that the BAMF will reopen such procedures' with regard to families with children - except infants and infants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 '.
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, according to the newspaper, pointing to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin agreement, it is the responsibility of the EU Member State to reach them first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
On the grounds that the office is now in office, the absorption capacity for families with minors in Italy has increased substantially.
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
The domestic political spokesperson of the left-wing group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children are threatened with children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system with illegal reception conditions and a threat to the child's welfare".
Second best outcome
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided blood donation services to other people.
At least twelve citizens were awarded on Friday.
In the meantime, 100 donations have been donated to 50 liters of blood by all, especially Jürgen Greule.
Traditionally, the congregation in the meeting of the council pays homage to the multiple readiness to donate blood.
"It is ingenious how our body is designed for this purpose, and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood to strangers, nor to this unselfish", underlined mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people", explained the district manager of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conservatives are broken into their constituents.
For example, three people could benefit from blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be taken in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK team leader.
Obviously, the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many booked hostels Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spent ten times the 500 milliliters of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it keeps interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensifying pressure.
Policymakers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with less members this month growing as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7%, and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that interest rates would become necessary in the next few years to rein in inflation fueled by Brexit, and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth cyclical package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more in this system - £115 billion sterling.
minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption."
At the interest rates, they repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" level than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
The Bank ’ s downward revised growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% relative to those forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell relative to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31, falling by 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision not to change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest-rate hike, with GDP rising from 0.2% in the second quarter of the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, though it will easily recover after the Bank ’ s end of the year.
The most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage increases, as tightening becomes even worse before it becomes better.
It added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" income collapse in the next few years, "but it added that wages will recover significantly at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound's sinks.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for prices and the economy to be fully achieved.
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest-rate rates, the call for interest-rate hikes had risen, as inflation pushed households hard, with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the Bank said that it was expected to do so and that it will again be attracted in the coming months.
The bank said that exceeding the ratio to its target of 2% is' quite 'to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline of the swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as creditors loudly seek business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who end the existing deals and conclude the new mortgages, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. '
NHS (The National Health Service) is supposed to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people.
Patients will receive HIV-Prevention Treatment as of September after a fight before the High Court against the funding of the NHS drug access to a "..
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken in intercourse before intercourse can now reduce the risk of infection in high-risk opatients by about 86%, is now estimated to be the first three-year study for 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the authority to pay for the EP despite the claim that the local authorities should fund it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and further clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infection risk.
Preparing sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are in question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a pediatrician can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as is specifically used, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September to September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. '
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP-Testmedizin has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important for this study to be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV, and for it to contribute to bringing an end to the spread of HIV into society.
The great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrank from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Davor I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room", says Joanne.
"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with them and made an offer on this day.
Since the first visit the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the spacious ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my request, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place for life for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.
"The steel plant is quite complicated", he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked in one another without having to bundle ourselves.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but of putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.
For the mezzanine floor there is a classical copper window of Retrouvius overlooking the glamorous living area.
Sealed gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, divided units offer space for all seating and glasses of Joanne.
By perceiving a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen unless it is used.
Combinable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"Ein bisschen Ingenieurkunst ging da hinein", explains Erfan von der stahlverstärkten, furnierten MDF-Tür.
"It is counterweight, so if you push the door high, very easily glides."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated", says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they managed to enlarge the surface of the soil and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and that therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home", says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square meters of something standard in something quite amazing.
Indeed, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers are fighting for a $500 million property empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of the largest real estate imperies Victorias worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Ball-Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and business assets.
Paul has wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother, Anna, the 38 real estate brothers have acquired more than half a billion dollars in value since the 1973 family bought a store in Smith Street, Collingwood.
The family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburb.
After an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the assets of the company and Paul about one-third.
A court ruling states that this means that Colin owns $316 million worth of property, and Paul is worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The departments proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled it out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some ownership incompetent.
In an early affair submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports by companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late 1950s husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought milk bars and delicatessen pastries and in the early 1970s a shop in Brunswick.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property that Colin opened in the first Jeansladen of the family.
Colin says that he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, claiming that Mark has been paid $10 million and Luke 26 million in the company ’ s default.
Both Lukas and Mark have said that Paul "has been bitterly bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin withdrew very much, even though he was a former AFL board member, and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can not say much" because the case before the courts is.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I in our current dispute to end", he said and added that he "still hoping for a solution".
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts," wrote Colin.
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of keeping the boss on an even course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House ’ s new chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House, which he repaired: poor information that falls into the president ’ s hands.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If Trump was annoyed by unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from officials who were convinced," the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fumes without their interventions.
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If his staff managed to keep him out of trouble several times, their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one has been consistent in preventing Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, made up of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a volcano, can respond to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he is eager to find out where they come from.
This is exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone gave the president malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "the source behind a bunch to be of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment, or that he has not provided concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and the White House Secretary-General, Rob Porter, have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives.
How did that work?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still seek influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the population's assistance is inherited and hoped.
The police across Europe are sending virtual postcards to dangerous criminals this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are not known by nature, indications are being hoped and requested from the population.
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar of Winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding on holiday destinations, as Europol said.
We have put together 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online enquiries have so far been arrested, at least eleven of them because of references to the publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a grave and return to the 'millionaire series' '.
Some of the West Midlands ’ wealthiest homeowners are back with some determined travellers on warfare, who have negotiated a grave drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull called the "millionaire series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May, but without having been deterred by a tomb excavated by the Council to prevent.
The tactful group found a gap in defence equipment and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
raging residents have afflicted the Council of Solihull, who said that it is' useless to deal with the problem '.
An anonymous resident said: "They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they thrown stones on the passers-by.
The Council must indeed be forced to implement it, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travellers were there in May and are now back.
More came yesterday evening, probably even more today. '
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with this by keeping long submissions to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council cannot even stop this. '
A native who did not want to be mentioned said: 'It is ridiculous that we have just seen the last round of this traveller just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area.
A Council spokesman for Solihull said: 'We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls, and we the necessary legal to as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case. '
From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30 000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenue was also lost by the Kurtaxe.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a gathering facility, given dramatically rising numbers of refugees who came to the district, causing controversy.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial at that time.
But, above all, Freudenstadt ’ s mayor, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interests at the time.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of three-star plus-category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Welcome to Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof you have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time and when you enter the house, you will see how extensive renovation works are carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings were partially dismantled, old baths were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in a Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built in.
Everything should be "beautiful to the citizen" later, as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry."
Swimming pool, wellness area and meeting room are part of the facilities.
You don ’ t want to position yourself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale inner city level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to be broadened, explains Scherer.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause have already led, Scherer.
The views of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
After the amount of investment required, Thomas Scherer does not want to specify exactly.
Nearly under a million euros, he expects.
The exterior panels are also placed on front, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace open to the public from the restaurant.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US Special Counsel Grand Jury sets up a jury.
In US President Donald Trump ’ s Russia affair, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have deployed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The panel began work in the last few weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" under appeal on the matter trusted people.
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
The CNN station reported that there are already initial invitations from the body to a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US secret services have accused the Kremlin of intervening in the 2016 presidential election, for some time.
Mueller investigates whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation focuses on several men who acted as Republican adviser in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also looked more and more at Trump ’ s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Trump Special Counsel had personally moved to the center and investigated the charge of whether the president might have hindered the judiciary in the wake of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether or not to charge charges.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called prosecutors.
They are usually switched on when they are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The body can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor in order to invite people to interrogate under oath.
According to CNN, invitations have already been issued to turn the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, as the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his campaign boss, Paul Manafort, were in talks.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the insertion shows that Mueller should not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary he should act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end in order to decide on the charge of.
Nevertheless, the appointment of the panel at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia's history is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives democrats a chance to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion, he knows nothing of setting up a Grand Jury.
This work also usually works in secret, he emphasized.
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Counsel in a 'fair' manner.
The former FBI boss James Comey said three times that it was not being investigated against the president.
One has no reason to believe that something has changed, and the explanation goes on.
But Mueller was only deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Trump ’ s accusations of smoking had become loud, he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey told a Senate Committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the Special Counsel and his staff.
That triggered speculation about whether Trump wants to sack Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special counsel, such as Richard Nixon, who later resigned in the Watergate affair, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president ’ s insistence on the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday that could no longer be dismissed by the special counsel.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of just under seven times the size of Berlin was solved by the slap.
This informed the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The large colossus, over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres, is now treading north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
There is no danger to people from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear according.
However, for about 30 years, there has been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice cuffs in the region, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be linked to global warming.
The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
As a result, the sea continues to grow and regularly breaks down.
Larsen C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this slap was the balance of guards and breaking off a few years ago.
A complete slap was broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to be said for the Larsen C-Schelfeis to be in danger, because the front edge has never been as far behind as it is at present.
In addition, the ice-plate is under tension and can fall apart if a key point drops a piece.
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, as it sweats on the water and freezes ice as much water as it does after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the slap causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and much faster than before.
This may increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, the British research project for monitoring Antarctica (Midas) writes.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shark of Antarctica, according to AWI data, with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
The transition from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the Ice Sheet is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the most extensive withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C-Schelfeis will be growing again or going back over the long term and possibly collapsing, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say that it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute this gigantic iceberg to climate change, the past few decades have seen many icebergs falling apart from the Antarctic Peninsula.
This long ridge of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has grown around three degrees in the past 50 years and is thus one of the fastest growing areas in which the temperature rises.
CDU wants house rates for personnel.
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant posts, the CDU is calling for the employers' association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer recess, the day 41 new posts in the administration have gone through.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have left behind their first day of work.
The courses at the circle are obviously very popular.
Around 620 applications were available for the places to be awarded this year.
However, there is still a lack of staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently there are still 50 jobs in the Mettmann circle.
Doctors and engineers, as well as general administration, are invited.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
The administration is to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for professionals, but also to counteract future applicants' scarcity.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, concrete measures for cross-trainers should show and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
This sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were previously not known.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of genuine 'competition between public employers'.
This involves a large number of employees who leave the service for illness or age.
So time to act, so that no more posts remain vacant.
But the CDU ’ s leader, Klaus-Dieter Völker, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently came as a surprise at the day of the day when he publicly questioned the capping of staff costs and the other parties stunned.
Peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed that allow for exit from the local employers' association.
"If we do not reach a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the towns and cities concerned - should seek a house tariff", says Peoples.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the collective bargaining system for the public service actually provides.
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you change to a higher level that is oriented to professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up, in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostituting Protection Act.
Last but not least, by the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy is tightening the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs working to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti ’ s warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Rettet', because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian Public Prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, and remains the salvation of human life our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue area," said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
"We can judge all the accusations currently being made only after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had rescued the boat from 'Youth Rettet', which Iuventa, has been monitoring since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take refuge on board migrants delivered directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can drive away so that ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting took place supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian coastguard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motive.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring 'substantial changes or disabilities' to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF) is.
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives, and with Chad, Niger, and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of being able to reach Europe.
Going and Trials
Neun Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the Michaelskapelle vineyards above Deidesheim.
It was followed by vantage points, partly on towers, from which you could look far above the woods and the predisposed plains.
There has been an increasing increase between them, for which long trials have been rewarded.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again the lookout point of view, connected by "flowige" as well as moderate ascents.
On the last two days, many elevation meters were held again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shopping huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathe a saline in the open-air inhalatory.
New town was also fired.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Konsole statt Rasen - Bundesliga rüstet sich für E-Sport
Seats the sports stars in the future in front of computer consoles, instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadions?
Fact is: E-Sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high Gagen inclusive.
This is also the first Bundesliga to become increasingly involved in this area.
At the beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, followed FC Schalke 04 later and most recently the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an E-Sports Division in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that there will be a number of clubs on this train.
Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup organises the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where the gamers of various clubs.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year old in particular, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under the Treaty, you could be present online far more often in these markets than just send the Bundesligamannschaft to Asia once a year.
What is it all about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or even football simulation FIFA are challenged at competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sport, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And the Asia-Pacific 2022 is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also long dealt with the issue.
For the Professor at the German Sports High School in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
Moreover, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness are needed.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also train their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fitte player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult to implement in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.
Positive points out the scientists the high integrative impact of e-sports.
Players are internationally on the move, as is a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the Deloitte Business Consultancy and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts e-sports rapid growth.
In 2016, more than €50 million was implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship, and large tournaments.
In three years, sales will be 130 million.
The Euro 2.4 billion of the Bundesliga football league is not enough.
However, the E-Sport "is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants.
There are many countries in the world.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are participating in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood-Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
Europe is also doing something.
In a Norwegian school E-Sport was introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"Compared to Europe, Germany is lagging behind", explains VfB's Executive Board Röttgermann.
Only in nostalgia to fall, and the old days to be narrowed, is no longer enough today.
It is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association, but also of aligning the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world", says Dutt.
"There is no way to hold on to the fact that only football remains as it has always been."
Gift eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The scandal surrounding toxic eggs has now affected almost all the federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and took all eggs out of sale across Germany.
In the shelves, only eggs are to be taken, which are shown to contain no fipronil.
Michelle Carter condemns the Conrad Roy for suicide because of the.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of condemnation behind bars and five years have been suspended on currency.
Carter was convicted of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is bleak.
My son was my best friend. '
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered a mental illness.
In red pants and a creme-coloured blouse, Carter was dressed with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken responsibility, 'she said.
"She has shown no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said that it was a 'terrible circumstance that she utterly deplores'.
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find out that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, have a significant influence on her actions".
A public prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said that there is' no day on which I did not see the loss of my beloved son.
I would like him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything, and despite all my pain that we are going to bear for eternity with us, I try to be there for his sisters' sake.
Roys Schwester, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be pursued by the realization that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children.
"Not to have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will keep for the rest of my life at me," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text releases revealed that it had encouraged him to end his life.
"Häng you on, spring of a building, make yourself, I do not know there are many ways", she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit by any press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder of her British fellow resident in Italy in 2007, was released two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30 years old, published in the Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new Mini-Lahm of FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
The FC Bayern is confident that the Confed-Cup-Sieger will have a great season for extra motivation as it does not hurt.
Something was different on his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But as far as and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer was to see, he made his pledged commitment to the arm.
"The trainer did not announce it," the Confed-Cup-Sieger told afterwards, after his first engagement as Bayern-capitals.
Well, the booth could have run better than 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from Coach could also interpret Kimmich.
Not the eight years old Arturo Vidal was chosen by young players, debutants and just from the holiday professionals existing C-Elf as the leader of the game, but he was.
Sugar is one of the most popular places to mourn a lot,.
So if you have been asked to step up the legacy of Lahm, you can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want to take as a player: responsibility".
On Wednesday the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-spawn.
Right at the back, this is his position, the white binding on the arm did her rest.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this start-up formation like the one who can take the rudder at best.
He gave instructions to try to steer the unplayed force.
He had the view of the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal, his lack of fitness to overplay (scarcely folded); Renato Sanches so that on Devil komm raus to attach to the performances of the Asia trip (also called appte only conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey do not adversely fall.
That, after all, worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acted sovereign.
Napoli-Sturm, who was nominally appointed, often struggled, also tried to win a few times in the building of the game.
His colleague, Mr Rudy, said that the result was' not as we hoped it would '.
But he also showed a decent performance in the debut.
Relocation, change of tempo: "For this style I was also fetched".
As uninhabited this Bayern world is still for the newcomers, it looked after the parties.
Rudy, for example, gave in the catacombs not one or two, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich passed after a few sticking statements in his new player's back.
There he heard from Süle an interesting sentence: "What is being done here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game.
After all, it must no longer teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies.
Austria ’ s most famous soccer player has just registered before the game on Twitter and wanted the Austrian FB ladies all the best.
Bayern-Legionär ist ja quasi Klubkollege von ÖFB-Kapitänin Schnaderbeck und fiebert mit unseren Ladys mit.
The Tweet of the Austrian soccer player of the year and Champions-League winner should be a special motivation injection.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern-Dusel.
Businesses satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It often reconciled the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is more than a year in which the new Minister of Economics Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
The biggest U-turn is NATO ’ s infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure before 2021.
A role in the country ’ s plans is also played by the West bypass, which is at the forefront of the Federal Road Map ’ s needs.
The goal is to run the line in December 2020, says Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier aims, as suggested by Wissing, to promote a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been ravaging for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Handwerkskammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bus, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A prize of 1000 euros for the best master exam and 2500 euros is seen as a bonus if graduates within ten years of master training become self-employed.
The list of domestic taxes for the country remains for a long time.
At the planned road construction, facts were quickly created, but at the same time the country lacked the necessary personnel, Jan Glockauer says, chief executive of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to adapt to the needs of local mobility, only 29 jobs have been filled up.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group vize Christian Baldauf points out calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million less in maintaining national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as to how to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
Moreover, the previous broadband expansion in the country is sobering.
In 2016, regional companies assessed net supply in an IHK survey only with the note 3.4.
They complained about increasing Internet connections and breakdowns.
Former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of Windkraftunternehmens Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where, after four months of disagreements, it has already cleared the field.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash.
A day before announcing Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that 'there are smarter options than restrictions', referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a call back.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems for neutralising exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called switching devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested, but in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been accused of being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions legislation in Europe, and a question focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message was sent to the Isar Floß on Saturday.
The city wants to protect the Isar.
For the Isar visitors to take part, a raft through Munich takes place on Saturday morning, which has a message.
Once again on Saturday the Isar attracts, there will be a big float between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
Special attention is given to the construction department.
There is a great deal of information on the raft.
It shows a rubbish mountain.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is..." the understanding of the Isar as a protective wild flow should be sharpened.
Last summer, the flow over the Isar River and this year, there were other actions and measures to achieve a cautious and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos bones and laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon drawings, the node havens of his characters are his trademark.
Also with 85 the Argentine still works on a film.
His message: laugh, 'because there is too much suffering in the world'.
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist he proposed himself among other things as a drawing for happiness cards through - what frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost", he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, at the end of the 1960s, he succeeded: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artists of cities inspire themselves.
Large round murdillo figures melt into drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he is still at the drawing table, according to his own data, working almost ten hours a day.
Over calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, plushy cushions and watches, his drollig figures continue to spread around the world.
For six years he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is due to come onto the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say it is strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he focuses more on the TV series, which, as his original drawings, is produced wortlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened with climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining because of the drought conditions and the diseases that are transmitted, which makes it difficult for scientists and farmers to find the solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits the dwarf, and in very dry weather there are very many of them. "
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts not only holidaymakers, but also perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long vegetable ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. '
Among the solutions considered are better water distribution and slowdown of evaporation from the ground, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year existence.

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The weekly newspaper Riodoce ’ s staff typically meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the Sinaloa state through organized crime, corrupt officials, and unstoppable drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what is more secure: they are supposed to take their children to the office, which was the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and building feelings rich.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government ’ s payroll or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous.
There is no respite from violence, and while the bodies are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are in attendance: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under attack and threats of federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleep, paranoia.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
Like most thousands of murders that are linked every year to drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though it is untroubled and even though the terrain is now more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we do not know why, we mistrust everyone."
On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his roter Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced out of his car and shot 12 times, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove his car away and damaged it near.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But, on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, which are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for one minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was blamed for not protecting his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival anti-trust fractions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected Gangmitglieder bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined forces with five colleagues to create Riodoce and sold USD 50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drugs problem," said Bojorquez.
With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and adverti.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting inquiries without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its courage in prosecuting the Mexican narcotics story, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live further," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You have to take on the task you are a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I do not want to be asked: "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what went before?"
The Riodoce team miss Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who, like a dockworker, was able to flood the friend who was generous with embrace and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his spouse?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it if you are dealing with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret start-ups and landmarks" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed", said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Be your own instincts trust.
If it is wrong, leave it away.
The anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials at home..,,,,,,,,,,,,
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space in which Riodoce ’ s staff met for security training, no cell phones were suddenly allowed, and days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers were among the 50% of the policemen who called the governor himself untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition Riodoce has clicked on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the hometown of the governor.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Public Prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the entire century all political levels.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of highly corrupt cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, the readers would have regarded Valdez ’ s column as the best informed source of kidnapping.
"Previously we would have known what happened", said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication have broken with our sources."
Valdez ’ s office has been devoted to storing space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because staff have become something that they themselves would never have expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become noisy by writing in organised protests' SOS Press' on the grounds of salaries and construction.
On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Sinaloa governor on the day after Valdez ’ s assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and letting them kill because they said the truth.
She has since asked her to be reinstated by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials involved in it, and a society that is equivalent.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were involved in organized crime under a cover.
Last year, the media guard group Articulo 19 ordered more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep the mouth half", said Ramirez.
Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zeta Cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones separated apart from their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz in 2015.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking frightens him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I was reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to summon.
A series of shootings with banditry and security forces near the town of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of cartel companies in the region.
From the bordstone edge they have published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirene hired near - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez raised a glance at the policemen who watched to see if they were willing.
If they were afraid at all, they did not show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"Like you can only remember to close", said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the interns asked me to send them to reporting on the street."
Dinosaur used camouflage to soften his enemies.
At first glance it looks like a statue, even if a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first discoveries of the incredible nose of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa the dinosaur".
It was so well received that they could even find that his scandalous skin was red brown - and they said it had had had something of a "troubled past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described it as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved state of affairs has amazed researchers who describe it as' really remarkable '.
According to reports in National Geographic, the scanted herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was in Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21, 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.
He met on something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2.500 pound (1.100 kg) heavy earth clutch.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
"If you blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has swallowed", said the main author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to see.
"It will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this herbivore, although covered with armor and resembled a changing tank, was likely to be threatened by meat eating dinosaurs.
The strongly armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-shading that is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed him to mix better in his surroundings and avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully covering it.
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the conterial shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the conterization is customary, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals using conterial shading - think of Rehe, Zebras, or Belts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real battle for survival.
"Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of Cretaceous time must have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal on evidence of his life, including his conserved intestine, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was torn into a river and driven into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to be much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conservative scalp skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal", said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early chalk time.
You do not need much imagination to reconstruct it, if you a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is on sleep.
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the King of them, who lived in Borealopelta for Tyrannosaurus Rex, was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavier monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta has been contaminated by death in the sea and mummified in the mummified mummy.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.
According to the museum it is the best preserved armored dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long peaks, which stood out from its shoulders.
Researchers believe that the plunged plant eaters were swamped by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.
The hidden remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still hollow panels along the dinosaur cover.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it will be.
Auxiliary residues of the skin still cover the hollow panels that carry the skull of the animal.
His right front fuss is on his side, his five fingers are spurred up.
I can count the scales on his sole '.
In thunderstorm: mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Hefty accident on Thursday evening at the A8: Knapp 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are many injured, kilometre long congestion and buffers.
On the motorway Stuttgart-München (A8), about 20 people were injured at a mass carambolage on late Thursday afternoon.
According to the first police data, between the noblemen ’ s funerals and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably also lorries, were transported elsewhere.
First of all, no data was provided on the exact number of injuries.
It is easy to get serious injuries, said a police spokesman.
A big offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In Fahrtrichtung München, a ten-kilometer-long backlog was formed.
As an AZ-Reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the counter-tram - through numerous buffers.
The fire brigade took note of the signs of the drivers, who now have to face severe penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
It was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group testet "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced: nothing is suspected of sleeping in the train and sleeping.
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
If the creator and wears an ungentle or rides the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Card control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The German Railways are currently testing the schaffnerlose Fahrkartenkontrolle.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two routes.
"Come the offer, we extend it.
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance transport routes in Germany, "said a railway promise.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket depreciation without Schaffner.
To be able to use it, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
You also have to buy it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way to book your ticket.
Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get into the train, call his ticket under "My Tickets".
In the test customers a button for electronic depreciation appears.
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passengers X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to Y in the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with already depreciated online-ticket.
We can therefore continue to sleep, continue to work, not to mention.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is intended to use the passenger.
"If you want to travel through our train crew without ticket control, check in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time in the train ", says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the greatest annoyances.
Because often you have yourself, in any case, but one of the participants does not have all the documents you need to evaluate online-tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to present is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the part or large room and delays in the control of their own tickets and puts the Schaffner at the end of the day to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same track are not yet activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Only one day after they arrived in New York City, sat in St. Louis prayer on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street," it said there.
Realise, because no one else had posted on their feed the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was always on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed by Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted an image of browns lifeless body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours.
"This is wild", Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She put her mobile phone to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, wearing a shield with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed, where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a belling dog.
In another video, she said, escaped another policeman's rifle and shouted: "I'll kill you... animals all."
"This is not customary" Ferrell remembered her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder that we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical."
At this moment I felt shaking frost.
I was angry and wept. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell, with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two promised a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state «.
"Thou remember how I taught thee when black people must fight for what they believe in?" reminded them of what they said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I could not take them with me, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
She must know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black child of women.
I have the feeling that I would be doing her a bad service to keep her away from it. '
The first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was located on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground when the activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped them to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on Essens-Justice and Health Inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has happened. '
weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document only "what happened.
A question came Ferrell in the sense: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"
This scepticism has been fed by countless cases of people, often of white people, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "We had heard that people born in Ferguson and raised are not centred on their voices and we wanted to do it differently...,,.,.,.,.,..,,.,.,,,,,
Folayan had already cooperated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism rum around death tract inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are presented, because so I will be presented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together", said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marry her wife.
"I felt like naked", said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people."
In addition, Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in managerial positions have worn the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. '
Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action", where Ferrell was selected due to her identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel your energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on currency for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A Chaos".
However, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. '
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery Gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population since the first presentation 2009 in proponents and opponents.
The subject is hardly cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While one would say to the Bit Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Do not a man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Größenwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the business, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bloom.
In addition, the gallery will be planned on the property where the farm market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.
The Galeria Macher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - for the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone room: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market for many years.
Our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women, are always very welcome.
We also discovered the butchers.
We would like to see this offer maintained during and above all after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there are also.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting.
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketing takes place in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of rent comes up.
The new project is unlikely to be very low. '
Eva Kilic: "Wozu Einkaufspaläste in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough of this in our city.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least get the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh products, mostly directly offered by the producer, and are above all inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.
It is a pity that there are no more special deals and what is left of them is likely to disappear. '
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not suit me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
First of all, where should the farmer market hall be during construction time?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the Bit Gallery eventually comes.
Or does the ghost bit-gallery already manage to distribute all the shops from Bitburg?
George Marquet: "This will simply not work.
And a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.
But for a peasant market hall, thanks to the crazy many - like I find - pointless construction projects in Bitburg no longer have a place.
When the farmers' market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. '
A matching similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticed equal - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen Tupfern and Haarschnitten, who were sent by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst had a 35-year-old prison sentence, having publicly disclosed them as secret diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline transformed her expertise into technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and from the 30 portraits, as someone with this genomic data could look, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly informed of the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six breaches of the Spionage Act, computer fraud, and theft.
By jail, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white fibre, in which Manning apparently sits unwell on a driver's seat and carries a platinum wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came to the fore of the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.
It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette mute and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people could look.
This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so contact Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal friends of letters, which were exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informers from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweet-capable ways to further unleash the rigid divisions that he should actually resolve.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things after the strange timing, she said that "things happen for a particular reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature including (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What humans will hopefully take away from it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are", said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, also to see.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these 30 stories are".
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the Comic-Novelle mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she emerges with a free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
"If they make your speech cold, then they have won," it says.
"So never stop the mouth".
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacres, which merge like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplogroups with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which was also behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing.
A nationwide crowd hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who is sought as suspects after a man was killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the District Court of Cook County show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, after several stitches verstarb.
A common warning system published by the Chicago Police Agency states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the spot of the event, and Detective investigated the key as murder, while the police actively searched for the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice President of University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now certified and had been excluded from entering the Northwestern University Campus.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman of the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the US investigation authorities in any way imaginable."
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge suspects to face up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them, intensify," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand-Plaza-building, who had just received a enigmatic tip saying that 1008 had happened in flat.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police currently works on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
The Russian deputy prime minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"In a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented the second part of the roadmap of WADA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, he has nothing to worry about Russia.
"Everything was announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future, "he added.
One of the criteria set out in the list, however, is that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: 'We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no public programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist. '
Mutkos ’ s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In talks with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have said repeatedly that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one has to accept this report unconditionally ', added Smirnov.
RUSADA was ruled out by the WADA ’ s Doping scandal in Russia in November 2015, following Doping ’ s implementation of doping controls.,,,,,,,,,,,, and,
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to Moscow's headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs anymore.
That was shared by business groups.
It is a mere precaution that no health impairment could be expected to continue, as stated in the communication.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which has demonstrably been tested negatively on fipron anti-Läusemittel.
Aldi wanted clarity and transparency in his customers.
The start ups that will help your company not become the next Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
Answers have often been vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She has called people from outside for help.
A new human resource start-ups race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's commitment, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaints hotlines, and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C Suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can follow why.
Businesses come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation, and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion worth of 2020, after the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent bad behavior and recognize a rising interest and activity early this year amid the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
As Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves ethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and lawsuits, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track complaints from staff.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices, can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "Social Media came to their right" that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry went online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that the agreement of Venture Capital Investors finds that both start-ups have supported.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February from firms like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising all capital to $47 million.
Glitcers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total financing to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more than they have done so far.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are only bets.
The staff want the feeling that you have accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices, and that the work that you do is worth, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees work and are committed.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase the commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you find support.
The data on employee involvement according to the experts of the workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company ’ s managers do not take action.
Indeed, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or even not, it can breed disappointments and cultivate employees.
"If you have asked for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"For if you are not going to follow employees wonder," Did you really hear me?
Do you care about it?
And who do you not care about why should I? '
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communications training to address the problems.
With Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry that is known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the break into the day.
There is a lot of UCLA footballers on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus.
Some have left their jersey upper and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the next morning at 6: 30 pm to the Water Football Center.
"This is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill", said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
For this reason, the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7: 15 p.m. in order to meet the players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the break in the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season shifted and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood practical exercises carried out.
They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August, 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their preliminaries against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the policy change of the NCAA even if they added the busy routing of players another point.
"We place this enormous burden three or four days on them, and it is very challenging", said Mora.
"And they simply pushed it through, they continue to plack, they are great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it really will be great. '
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will be an easy task given the clear lines of its fields of adjacent parking and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upper-class, which has already been covered with footballs, which will be a safety net behind a gate post.
Bruins-Spieler should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to record an exercise there.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I am not very concerned about this.
We have a plan. '
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news.
Facebook wants to send more potential articles to fact-checking auditors from third parties and show their results under the original contribution, said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible wrinkles and send them to fact-checking auditors who may display the results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main defense points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they have influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to penalize social media networks if they fail to eliminate hasty postings, as they did before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the US, France, the Netherlands, and Germany a test of the new fact-checking will be launched.
"In addition to the recognition of which stories are challenged by fact-reviewed third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share", said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
You added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Create a comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squash music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says weary.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
"A Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobin," he says.
"This is his thumb-down pressure!
And letters always smell after smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were himself.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle almost four months ("To be honest: I have given my welcome a little overvalued") this seems all too good to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the moncited hymn creatures on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He wandered through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape designers, gardeners and sometimes also with artists working on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night trank he "whiskey and began to write".
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats" Oh, put it on the attic ".
Tagebücher, letters from the time of English empires, maps that depict who possessed what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.
Young, let everything go his way! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in the English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that appeared in 1380 at the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising was a good start.
Perhaps the two are linked? '
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of Jesuit's patron, which hidden the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the jewel Arthur Darrell is depicted from the 18th century, which staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "Messrs seemed to be quite palate to keep making debts and spending money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men redeemed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise Erbinnen. "
After the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He has made a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium, which has since been called back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like: "Ach, now I must be ready again with the damned life."
Campaign started: More than 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf is enveloped.
The city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Thursday's round show) with the cover of the 301 year old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf.
Until Thursday mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team will keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival at the Grafenwerth island as the culmination of the campaign.
"Too beautiful for us.
Or? ", ask the machers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't think this (of course!) really", they write on their website, which was released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that as a bath honey, we know the beauty and attractiveness of our city well. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, meaning more.
"It is necessary to formulate an instantaneous promise, one that gives the city a unique unique unique view."
After all, they are competing with other communities.
The city of Bad Honnef is making a middle five-digit sum its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs.
Military reforms in Turkey – Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army
Every year, in early August, Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council (YAS) on retirement and promotion in the officer corps.
This week too.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the seat of the Prime Minister.
During the discussions under the Presidency of the Heads of Government, the five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and External Affairs have now also participated.
This means that civilians in YAS were in excess.
The government prefers the reins in the military.
Generalstabschef Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the army commanders, the air forces and the navy were deposed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army's ranks - mostly because of alleged connections to the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen's movement, which Erdogan sees as a draftsman of the coup attempt.
Around 486 people directly involved in the attempted coup have been negotiated in Ankara this week.
On the day after the coup, Erdogan described the coup attempt as "God's gift," because he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces "completely.
But does Erdogan really manage the army?
At the end of February the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unbehagen im Militär-Hauptquartier".
In general, there are concerns about an increasing 'Islamisation' of the army, which, among other things, is manifesting itself in the lifting of the ban on headscarves for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
In any case, the major clean-up of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered further 7395 civil servants, including 2303 police and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdoğan tamed the military.
The generals used to be the real masters of the country.
Three-times they explored their role as guardians of the secular state order.
Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step, not least in invoking the European Union ’ s reform requirements.
Former officers say that Erdogan is targeting Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a not-so-named officer who sought asylum after the attempted coup from fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years' time.
If so, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts in the alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army to purge.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are 'weakened', say NATO diplomats.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, cited by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the US the way citizens from other countries spend green cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to sank the track for racetrack huttle.
Over the past few months, the future of the racing platform huttles has been dashed again and again - now it is to be done very quickly.
Even before the end of the year the maroden route is to be built on the tourist railway.
In order to secure the future of the race steigshuttles in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport information, construction work will begin this year.
"With the decision to further order and rehabilitate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this especially important link for tourism," explained Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the track was about EUR 2.5 million.
From this sum the country takes 75 percent.
The Treaty, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being put to a final vote, declared sin.
The Ministry and the Southern Thuringia Railway as operators already agree on the technical details.
"This is the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated", said Sühl.
The planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for eleven years.
In December 2017, the Race Shuttle should be ordered regularily.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau railway stations and Rennsteig, tourists in particular. the. the,,,,,,,,,,,
Over the past few months, a pilot pilot has been tested to see whether the route is being used by enough people to re-regulate it in the future.
The route is also very long.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned about it.
Just as you thought that 2017 cannot become even more crazy, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yes, indeed.
Sex-robots are now a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield, and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest and type of fingernails.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in publishing his new report.
Modern sex puppies have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also customize his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it is even more worrying because many robots have "personalities" that would make a step-ford-woman look progressive.
Modern sex puppets have become robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot allows, for example, its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there is the Roxxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as well as possible", Swabian the site of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
During the day you also have your votes - like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in mood"!
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step on Frigid (meaning here: reluctant) Farrah, worry most.
On his website compared True Companion Roxxxy with a Vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no roxxxy?" is it said on the site.
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its rising popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what trickles out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has irradiated sexually assaulted women.
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the winding body and the exited eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.
The aim behind these sex-robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn star-proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, when it comes to their 'personalities', the robots are not real women.
You cannot separate yourself from your pet or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that hints at independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjugation.
In other words, they are slaves.
Or, to put it bluntly, in 2017: Committees
Trump ’ s great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.
It has become a trump card trump era that political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small numbers.
Around Christmas and Erntedankfest there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump.
We are all supposed to be bursting our filter bubbles.
Less noted, Trump ’ s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousine, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been engaged with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, anyone who knows them, including the Republican relatives, with whom they fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and curiously on the same side.
It is certainly a good thing to eat, but it is also important to me that this entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the stellar impact of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we talk about 'normalization' and Trump, we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his captains will not kill us any more.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario, in which Trump normalizes right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear to be the epitome of income relative to its standards.
Today, I find myself caught by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's funny version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, which knew 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - which both compared to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild crime.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in the Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a cafe.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarce and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely finster and the climper-permitting music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city is not fulfilling the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great roundabout in northern London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strange magical experience, since here two years old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on it and all have a great time.
If I had been able to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced in a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the charge.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need.
The poor woman in the department store was apologetic grinsend, while I tired the experience made her my credit card with five stars to reach.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pains from prison moved to hospital.
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was brought to hospital for treatment of cuts in his wrists, according to prison authorities, following a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine ’ s 2013, putting a door to the toilet cabin several times in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night penetration hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National Criminal Authority said that it would object to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his penalty will be increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg.
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the four-clandestine workers from Fützen and Epfenhofen were made redundant during the holidays and in secondary schools.
Three of the dismissal students will go to the secondary school in the future, four at the Realschule.
Schulleiterin Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school leaving, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chickenerhof, but then is released into freedom.
This included the muntere Schar a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it break out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken tree, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken broke up, the eagle spread on a high mountain his wings and defused.
After that, the classes showed three and four in the introduction of Yvonne Frank a chicken match.
The hens danced with the young Gockeln, the cylinders trug to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said Schulleiterin Angelika Sitte.
The boy is different from the other boys (chicks), but it belongs to them.
He will never be like a chicken.
His determination is to be free.
She would wish every fourth complainant that he feels accepted in his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to my colleagues, former schoolmaster Michael Müller, who has always been involved in teaching passports, and parents ’ representatives.
The chicken season is now over, explained Klassenlehrerin Sophia Schumacher.
They leave their students very reluctant after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Finally, they have been able to rely on the four-clandestine.
At the end of the course, all students have a song from summer time and holiday time.
It was a great pleasure for the children to do so.
For the new school year there are already eight first class students registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted on television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal people was arrested in Sithonia by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released, while currently an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have stepped up control of the free campuses and are imposing considerable fines on anyone who is found in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly will the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust emissions behaviour of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt from this.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives invaluable:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have Schummelsoftware", says Anja Smetanin.
Deren Nachrüstung ordered the KBA.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months, but have not yet set a precise date.
Daimler announced that he would write to all concerned.
If an inspection lapses anyway, it will be done within that framework.
How long should the changeover take place?
"Schwer zu sagen", meint Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"Because we have seen voluntary action by car manufacturers on the environment so far not."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE rät to wait.
Presumably, foreign producers would follow, says Smetanin.
Is there a massive drop in prices for Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
But it is in the regions where bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE rät, with a sale still waiting to see.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the acclaimed Kennedy Center awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be given at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, known with progressive TV series, therefore announced that he would not participate in the gala.
The 'New York Times' said: 'This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that is a burden on me'.
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We Make the City Life-Value
Roland Wacker, Haslach's mayor, retires next year.
The job is already advertised - suitable applicants are rar.
For 31 years, Wacker has been the mayor of the city.
And the work still gives him great fun as he mediates in the press interview.
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, it is astonishing that no application has been made to date.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible time.
So, while observing the regular termination periods, there is still enough time to deal with them.
Since Haslach acts as a subcontractor to the administrative community, the applicant must present appropriate qualifications.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they were no longer able to fill them out, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the people is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some major projects have accumulated, looking back on the Wacker with pride.
"We make the city worth living", he is sure of the building office and his staff.
But there are also varied projects on the agenda in the future: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatzes, for example, is underway.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will hit with around EUR 1.5 million when we get it right.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. "
There is plenty of room for a city builder.
Haslach ’ s own Bauhof and Gärtnerei can respond flexibly to many things.
"You can move a lot", says Wacker, and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to have "an eye for what fits" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing mayor emphasizes.
In any case, the mayor bears a high responsibility.
He is Bauherr, "at the end everything runs here over my table".
With care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in the process for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) has been working for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, wishes Wacker: "We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and want to stay".
Continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to have completed his studies as a diploma engineer or bachelor with a degree in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and construction law.
The Municipal Office is responsible for the construction, construction and construction of high and low buildings, planning, basic work, administration of urban properties, town-farm with building yard and city gardens as well as under construction authority including monument protection.
Bicycle cycle routes: Südbahnstrecke locked.
According to the police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway slide in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for night hours after them.
Near the Tatort there were witnesses of a rosaroter scooter and a bicycle driver observed.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich", said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch to APA.
The perpetrators, or rather the perpetrators, would have put themselves at great risk and also jeopardised rail transport.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the railway system, as well as the delay and the costs of the rail replacement transport, the Pyongers of the railway customers could also be connected to the perpetrators.
All in all, it should be said that there is a 'substantial' sum.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, and rail transport on the southern railway line could be avoided without any obstacles.
Approximately ten passenger trains were dropped on Friday morning, two of them related to long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fall, but they were late.
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts have also been damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease).
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The incurable state that affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach shrinks and leaves hungry, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation, it can result in inflammatory intestinal disorder.
In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance conducts immune cell in mice that carries a particular bacterium in its input.
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to replace the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal ilieus, if the same system also affects humans.
The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had been separated but did not.
She suspected that the difference with the dark robioms of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The demons of the mice were sequenced DNA and six types of bacteria were found which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them in the mice.
Moravians were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a dark robiom, and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grew in a fluid and then transferred small quantities of fluid - without bacteria - to unmature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50%, but when the Tryptophane values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans like mice, but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disorder.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high Tryptophanwerte in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has a "genius" with Nemanja Matic.
At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic signed a "genius", Jose Mourinho believes that after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched to popularity.
Matic, however, was excluded from the preparation Asia-Tournee of the Blues and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football", said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku died in the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho had three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job", three of his four priority new commitments.
"Three out of four, for which I thank the association", he added.
"I'll be happier if they get for me four of four, but they have taken great trouble."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilot fled from Seattle in the U.S. State of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner about the U.S., which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens the shape of a Dreamliner was to be.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky.
New blow to Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, socialist prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
It was not a disorder from the party ’ s central, just a headwind from the covenant, that led to the most important desire of the election campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz has led the party, this has changed radically.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching events in the SPD Governed provincial capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in return.
They were depths.
One after the other.
The Bundes-CDU sees, after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Rot-Grün simply cannot reliably govern", said CDU-Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising faction of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s government into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country ’ s election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition.
The Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway low-Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to give her mandate back.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate ’ s will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate, "said the Federal Executive Director and campaign manager of the German Green Group (RND).
"That must not be true," he says, "a SPD campaigner, when the new Hiobsbotschaft reached party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is on the verge of the Green MEP Elke Twesten joining the CDU without his own government majority.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national federations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the comrades back then.
After the country elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was then made clear - and everything was much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into baptism, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party smooth around.
After a few weeks, the comrades rappeled again.
Then, when they had just taken new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of the country, lost to that weekend his Nimbus because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because he was pretty wrong in crisis communication afterwards, what you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gas affair and its role in the supervisory board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticised for some time.
Miese poll numbers were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because, in recent weeks, attempts have been made to place more and more emphasis on the covenant.
The ambition of the former Mayor of Hanover to build up his power in Berlin was also unconcealed in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to do so, because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
It is because the party internal dispute is basically not to blame the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz has not.
Sometimes the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, at the disgraceful parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democratic, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, leader of the party left in the SPD federal faction, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person, but through the national list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony Member continues.
The logical consequence would be for them to return their mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD federal fraction, laments a "undemocratic maneuver".
"The electorate was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now the personal career memory of a future CDU MEP falsifies the election result," said Oppermann.
He called for the backgrounds to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or no further commitments by the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for Places III
Anyone who wants to restore his home in the years will soon be able to receive support from the country.
In addition to this, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG Stadtentwicklung informed on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a retrospective of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been areas of rehabilitation in Empfingen.
At that time, in the Sanierungsgebiet I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
By 2016, the grant was still 60% in the area of rehabilitation II.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is important to promote internal development as well, and not just to develop new buildings.
On April 4, the President of the Republic of Karlsruhe informed us that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The total amount was EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would be received from the country, the rest from the municipality.
How does a rehabilitation area arise?
We will continue to study Schindler, where the "really old" houses are.
However, there is also a role to be played in the planned area, if any.
If necessary, the ceilings of the territory could be deferred again.
The STEG represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder-Programm "Soziale Stadt", in which the remediations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be implemented objectively, that is, per plot.
Finally, the rehabilitation area would be defined as a statute.
The grant period has been running until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would be carried out only once, in which the parties involved in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire on the filling out.
In November or December, as far as possible, the decision on saturation is to be taken so that the remedies can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each commune had to carry out the above preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing and deciding when to assess the maladministration in urban areas and to what extent.
It will also be entered in the basic book for the property.
Pietzschmann will come back again after receiving and get a picture of the situation, promised them.
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet", which includes the construction state and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the 'budget and housing sheets', information on size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be made.
The blue "business sheet" is to be filled only if premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.
Moreover, rebuilding measures are not eligible...... the. the. the.
Schindler emphasized that the distribution of aid according to the "greyhound principle" - who comes first, first exhorts.
You cannot reserve funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" have been shown to make the attendant a restoration "tasty".
British inventors set themselves a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car.
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office, and even start with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq.
He has met Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cats and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an additional cost of £300 per lock.
The married father of one now has built both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands of thousands.
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers the amount of military data left to TIME magazine up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire-fighter car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility", wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superiors, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 a.m. on the South Lawn for the event at 15 o'clock, and so long remained until the pitch between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening was cleared.
The note adds that if the departure should be delayed from the White House, due to the limitation of the hours of service, a second team would be required for the return flight.
The original flight crew was on the ground during the event at the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the plane during the time.
It was not clear from the TIME records that a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Klingt, as if you are closed," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to reform health reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he advocated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But to demand their use only for a photo OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential plane was in Melbourne, Florida, Taxidienste, against the background of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
"The White House is thrilled by the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states shows produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX 1 crews often perform training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to estimate US presidents in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 led to 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training requirements of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant.
Helicopter units also flown 11 hours this day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers did not take the burden on any of the other props presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not hold budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to the US Department of Defense ’ s hourly rate for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour.
Recognition of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"The cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, refunds for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance, and contract completion.
At that time, the former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present these week things made in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the federal state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this. '
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he saw his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he was fighting for a fire brigade in the driver ’ s seat.
In the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before Tricky Task
At the table third Suchsdorfer SV, the top player of the Second Tennis League will join.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five scores, the top champion of the Second Tennis League has always been the winner for reality.
Teamchef Marius Zay certainly has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar format.
I find the team very good at the rear positions. '
Imports from the high north are particularly important for class and stability in the search site SV.
"Deren Dänen und Finnen können sogar auf Einsätze im Davis-Cup verweisen.
And they are also strong in double, "says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"That will be difficult for us as always.
As you also need a good portion of luck. "
The Neusser team for the Trip in the High North stands practically.
His blue-white debut could give Maxime Janvier.
At the moment, the Italian Biella tournament of the Challenger Biella is not being played by an active Frenchman to the Bundesliga-Partie, but the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), playing at the Czech Liberec tournament, will be in use for the first time this season.
The hitherto unattended Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarus Andrei Vasilevski still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could join the team again.
It was not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one junior world ranking in January 2016, to fill someone out of the coach ’ s room at Marius Zay.
How America Can Mint OMV
True, Donald Trump did not work happily when he put his signature under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his haste to enact the law", the Congress has unlawfully "unlawfully" unpacked, he estimated.
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US push.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, since then, investors from the domestic OMV, who, together with other European companies, co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Railway Nord Stream 2, have been alarmed.
The threat is enormous.
Nonetheless, it is too early to estimate the consequences, according to the oil company ’ s official statement.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would have to bring sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at which of the Group could defend itself and which could really hurt it.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is placed at the centre of the hit series of Netflix.
Despite the second season of Narcos, the Pablo Escobars Killer is unveiled, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The staffles three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest Bösewichte of the show.
With the third season, DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful patrons, they operate "as a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type inviting American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city employs 46 kitchen aids.
The city organizes the Kita lunchtime again.
With strong contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban nurseries.
On September 1, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban childcare facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Director of the Department of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased...
Covered will continue to be out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 day-care centres in the Krefeld area, 44 children receive a warm meal at noon.
In the last kitajahr, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are served 45 hours a week are not given a lunch in the Kita," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour tour, if children stay until 2 p.m.".
46 part-time employees have a kitchen service from 1 September: they provide the food supplied, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, carry out the meal individually, give the food out, clean it, clean the kitchen.
"The employees are categorised as a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven-group institutions - decides on the amount of time.
"Die Küchenhelferinnen gehören jetzt fest zum Kita-Team", sagt Pommeranz zufrieden.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for Kitaleitung to implement pedagogical concepts".
It is also a question of healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food".
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Also for children.
"They have a known force in the kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for children.
The cleansing of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning personnel.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm of improving the quality of the kitchen, which it has proved to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison between self-governing and outsourcing for the city.
And that, though 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours are not so strong in the area of education for some 750 people," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, President-in-Office of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will stand in the provinces in the Council elections, three women will stand for the role of Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be handed over peacefully by a democratically elected government to the.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan ’ s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to wipe out 13-year-old girls.
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to deprive a 13-year-old girl.
According to information from the police, men spoke to 13-year-olds, who stood up with friends at the Kolping Street, at 2.55 p.m., because they wanted to telephone with the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with her friends.
In response, one of the perpetrators tried to attack the girl ’ s cell phone and necklace, but this was abused for some time.
Without loot, the Duo fled.
The two young men could be arrested later by the police.
The investigations are under way.
GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to reassure Managern of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said that the company has weighed over the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces biscuits alongside other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea.
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be "first experienced" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the head of the company's branch, GMB Scotland McVitie called for 'concern' that funding for the modernisation of production lines would not be pushed forward '.
GMB-Senior-Organisator Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workers are focusing heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the perspective of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs, and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a booming production presence at McVitie.
A spokesperson of Pladis said: "The Filialleiter at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly because we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross-location, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize Tollcross's heritage as a production site, and if our operations change at the site, employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this.
Has the PSG Barcelona warned against Neymar three years ago?
The page of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not succumb in its persecution of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to resolve his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of three years before the World Record?
The sensational approach has fueled the summer transfer window, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning for 89 million pounds last season to Manchester United.
After the end, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the world ’ s most paid professional athlete. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has imposed his way out, although a source close to the Catalan state insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president of this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the International of Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.

Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Papst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Papst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann thinks so.
The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen keeps up for discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reformist movement "We are church", declared after publication to the German press agency, he expects of the former Regensburger Bischof and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.
It would serve the image of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their misapprehensions at that time.
The Vatican chancellor "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the fact that, in reporting on violence, double standards are applied to the domains.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that the 'shameful and shameful acts' which should be punished and prevented in the future should be taken into account, but that the 'degree of medial manipulation', the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal", writes Scaraffia.
Also Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian radio: "You like to go to the church and this is a sought-after fresco".
She also pointed out that, in her youth, "Hunting was a very normal pedagogical tool" to deal with french children as I was one.
It would be unfair to apply current standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In the context of the reports on abuses, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Unfairly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial band "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection", says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him", he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is contained in the 440 page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, appointed by Bistum Regensburg?
Altogether 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were "victims of assault with high plausibility" between 1945 and the early 1990s, 67 domains were sexually abused.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "In summary, it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. used physical and psychological violence in many cases.
Particularly with high emotionality, punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Despite this, contrary to many other accusations, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence, even recollect positive memories with him ".
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger disagrees with him.
Mr Hesemann, the 440 page report on the 'incidents of violence against protection foals in the Regensburger Domspatzen' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholera and a perfectionist, who has become more effective when a dome music musically did not deliver top performance.
How do you evaluate this final report as your biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger comes in at all.
He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violent processes at the pre-school also took place outside its sphere of action.
At best, it can be accused of being too late or of not taking the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
For example, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understandable", as extremely good-natured teachers, who regularly cook the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbones, and "always outsourced" by grapes of children.
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outrages.
The fact that he did not only warn with stools and the keyrings on the floor, but also with earrings and all too french guys on the hairs or ears, he himself had already pledged years ago, deeply regretted and apologised for this.
In his honor salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s, with parents like teachers.
Do you also know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state-run gymnasium.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence on the pre-school stage, these are, of course, small cases.
It is a question of whether it is not related to his acquaintance and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI.
On the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him still work diligently.
The truth, however, is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media a lot has been reported in connection with the report on abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger, in the final report, also place any complication or complicity in sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: No.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have familiarized himself with the master of the cathedral.
Not even parents were here.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about this," said a spokesman for the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with educating sexual abuse has been, and yet most victims remain silent.
If they did not even trust parents and siblings, certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a way that was professional.
How do the domain treasure students assess Ratzinger ’ s role in cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A questioned student said: "Concerning sexual abuse... I don't see a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I also think it is really absurd to assume that, of all things, he has opened up himself... bunches of penetrating or clear, or rather opened up, rather than towards her parents, boarding school teachers, confidence teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
Thus the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that the student and / or their surroundings were familiar with him in the run-up to the event could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore entitled to free up any co-decision.
It cannot be reproached for not having prevented or displayed it.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these crimes in foreign affairs, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media a lot of "Gewaltexzessen" was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report of 'look the way'.
Do he have to live with this charge?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything has been mixed and mixed in the coverage, and it has become a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is precisely what misuse of the report is.
After all, it is clean: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the domains, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents dating back to 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a chorus leader of the dome treasures.
The whole terrible pedagogy of caning, the cases in which boys have been harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all took place on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boy first to face when they were already on the domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most witnesses stress, the theme "pre-school" was taboo.
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" states.
What was different about the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: While there was discipline, no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, who concludes in the report that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him".
At most, the accusation remains of having looked away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the conditions on the pre-school.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school that he did not work on, (witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only back in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain domain domain anthem, which even reproduces the report.
He points out in it that 'the caning continues to be practised in the pre-school'.
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when caning was also banned in Bavaria a long time ago.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded.
You cannot say, however, that he has always looked the other way.
That is simply not true.
It was only in 1980 that the caning of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.
What do you see?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "pitfalls of anachronism", that is, the danger of judging past by moral standards today.
The prince is right here.
But that does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which has been abominable at all times, and not to what has been buried in the pre-school of conflict and violence against innocent children, which goes far beyond what was then the practice.
That is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all that had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishment, that is to say, slap and pull the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, it was strictly adhered to.
What image of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger given in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?
Can the issue of caning also be addressed?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI., tells from his perspective, because played the domspatzen only a side role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he had a strict regime there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class status, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which took place twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and bonbonbons alone, you don ’ t even make big singers out of recalcitrant boys and before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-thinking.
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and repeatedly experienced himself as a wonderful, humorous, ground-friendly, deeply believing and heartfelt good person, from whom one cannot imagine that he could only do one fly a bit.
I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his Emeritation, to keep him in touch regularly, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
Those who do not give him up to now that he was too strict to them are clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing music to the world.
And that he was always a good teacher, a strict father, certainly, who may be - but also a loving respect sperson, to whom they still stand up today and which they almost despise.
I would ask you to make it quite clear once again that everything you accuse him of is educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have been able to overcome this time long.
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.
The evil intention behind this is all too obvious.
The report that has just been published relieves it.
Now the decency zone, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without whom, outside Bayerns and perhaps even Germany, no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, would finally leave peace.
