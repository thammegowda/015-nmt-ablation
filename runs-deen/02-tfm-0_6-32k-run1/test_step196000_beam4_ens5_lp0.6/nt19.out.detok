DFB Chef Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that naturally depends on getting into the conversation, that you also talk to him about why he felt one or another, as laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the soccer podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the debate about Özil ’ s photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he deplores Özil ’ s resignation of 92-fold national player.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had played further for Germany.
I also assumed, to some extent, that this would be the case, "said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July, justifying that Grindel did not defend him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared to talk to federal trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "you leave a team or change a club that you talk to his trainer and I think it is a pity that this conversation has not come about so far".

At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire gun Linz was alarmed at a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade crashed and found the hut in full fire.
The roof had to be removed in practice and fire rubbish absolutely needed.
According to owners of the burning garden hut, he had hired a battery to store at noon.
This may be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to fire brigade, the charger was the largest intensity of fire.
The damage caused by the fire must be determined - as must the cause of fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectors ’ pieces in his garden hut.

Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned.
"The Diesel Task Force still exists", said development director Peter Mertens to the industry magazine "Automobilwoche".
The jailed and certified Audi boss Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would be dissolved soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations are expected to be tested", he said at the time.
Mertens said: 'At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in the process of recovering the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandals at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer has made serious organisational changes so that such a scandal never happens again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler ’ s future and wants to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after acquaintance of the exhaust gas fraud.
In doing so, he knew or deliberately ignored the manipul.
Bram Schot is currently head of the sales department as the head of the Executive Board of the company.
Due to the changeover to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there were production failures at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronner Stimme".
Basically he sees a falling demand for limousines like the Audimodells A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult", he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel is seeking re-election - Lahm is to become the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair in the coming year, once again wants to stand for office as President of the DFB.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes," said Grindel as a guest at the early Sunday morning in the "Current Sports studio" of the ZDF.
We must always try to re-elect ourselves, I will do so.
Then you have to check if the support is there.
According to the Verbandschef, it would be odd if he had no desire to participate in the project for the future after the match for the football EM 2024.
Grindel has been the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who overthrew the summer fairytale affair since April 2016.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future chief European organiser Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that in this role, he will continue to advise the Bureau and then, of course, be invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
Speculations about whether Lahm could be his successor as DFB chief, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that, in future, a national player without a migrant background, should become the embassy of the DFB.
Currently, this office of native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic from, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If, without a migrant background, it is clear in society and football and says," the issue is important because we have to look after ourselves ", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work," said Grindel.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib-Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others, three days earlier.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite Gülen ’ s movement in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and hurt the German-Turkish friendship, "he said.

Several thousand police officers were in use, including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is criticized for being considered an extended arm of the Turkish Government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Schrecksekunde
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B won a concert at the New York Central Park for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease.
"You are engaged, wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival in the night to Sunday around 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that is a dream.
Cardi B entered a red outfit with Fransen and golden microphone.
I am nervous, I sweat, but it is okay, because I am here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, have shown themselves on stage in the multi-hour spectacle.
However, there was a spectator when many spectators thought that the sound of a falling metal was perverse for shots, feared and tried to flee.
In short, panic arose, people ran through each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, the organizer Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin reassured people from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concerts were free of charge every year on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to ergattern had to read and distribute photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the many musicians and actors there were applause from the audience - Buhrufe for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, Flake, however, in the US Senate ’ s Judicial Committee, advocated the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, thereby upending many women.
At least three women have levelled abuses to try to rape Kavanaugh, who rejects them.
Flake called for a FBI investigation into the accusations after two women who, according to their own data, have experienced sexual assaults themselves, confronted him with a lift at the committee meeting.
"You can also come together at any time in a lift with me," said Flake now at the concert in New York to the crowd.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends Rauswurf of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the Rauswurf of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the office of law firm, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had sent a t-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription 'Freedom for Journalists' and went into the first series.
The T-shirt, if not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about disrupting the outcome of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has created a strong unrest, which is unacceptable.
He has therefore led people to get the man out.
He said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely independently of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
Turkey ’ s leaders blame the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities either: only in early September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of the journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel imprisoned for revenge.
They arrived freely and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey trials are still ongoing against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-deserved know him his fans normally: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at David Fitz twice: Yes,.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is known for a lively conversation at the Theke der Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller has a lot of beer, some wine or even more processive drinks to attract the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing records.
On Friday another episode of the popular Talkshow was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your verdict" or "The Ghost Day".
The Munich trip to the high north was not very good.
On Saturday he posted a rare fie - his face is completely broken, the eyes only two small slits.
The Bett-Selfie shows a completely loud Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful cat.
At his fans he posted some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now won: "Rule one: goes NIE to Inas night.
Usually two: never trinks the black suction.
And injection.
And the round of Eierlikör, which melts Ina around half three, also leaves away.
Alcohol consumption is literally written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the offspring.
They were abundant of instant quarries, fish crumbs, or, presumably, most purposeful, headache tablets.
Other amusing simply glanced over the sight of the usually attractive cinema.
As Ina Müller has survived the next sauna store, it has not yet been known.
Since she already moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and betrayal.
The starting point in the 36 km long railway trail in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Scherben, Cigarette Coats, Müll and Unrat, demolished dustbin and now dismantled shields - for a long time now the starting point with a seat group for cycling on the Haaße hill in Treysa.
The Rotkäppchenland railway line is more than a glorious sight for the flagship project.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC Group Schwalmstadt but also others, so the Radverkehrsbeauftragte of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen has.
The problem has already been raised in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
There is no solution.
The proposals range from the laying down of the seat group to regular unloading of waste containers and cleaning of land at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities", says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been submitted to the local council.
It is not only the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrating weekends.
This is not only often said to be the case, but also destroyed in the event of a failure: posts from the earth, dustbin demolished, shields burned, seat furniture burned.
Volunteers have already been cleared up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
You will be delighted to find the Rastplatz on the cycle path in Treysa meeting place for saunas.
"Along the entire cycle path there is a clear emphasis on the Haaße hill," confirmed by the Radverkehrsbeauftragte who is now also taking care of the new Radstätte in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If it does the same fate, it will be expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "It is possible that the threshold is significantly higher, that the common good is intertwined.
But that would presuppose that a police strike would then occur in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants to develop the Haaße hill.
It must be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the radar path you can be very satisfied.
The tourist marketing is still able to grow.
Our cycling path is very high quality compared to other in Germany, so the ADFC members.
As a highly critical danger source, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no sign on the Haaße hill.
In the case of rain traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow, "she.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but it is a problem for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the See See
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D ein Lied für Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Stadtteiloffensive Hiltrup, in the "Musikcontest für große und kleine, junge und erfahrene Musiker".
A contest with eyebrows in the sympathetic Hiltruper family, as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family coexistence with coffee and cakes from the honorary official of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the Ein-Mann-Band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long in Hiltrup of the Albachtener, the novels of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp family and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen that in other parts of the city.
Womit sahen sich die Texter verbunden?
The Hiltruper lake and the market alley were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig arbitrary the avenue in his striking song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Again and again the experience of co-existence in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke belebte die kurzen Umbaupausen mit Kurz-Interviews mit den Interpreten oder Hinweisen zu ihrem Schaffen.
So he learned of Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
From the Tontechniker Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew to report that the youngest member of the Ludwigshafen - at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed his allerhand on Youtube.
"It is not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favorites of the jury there was nevertheless something special - so that others can hear their songs.
A whole CD can be Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer, who impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
As everyone has said, the children went to the final once again - and even without electronic support - 'right', as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects originality, relation to Hiltrup, interference of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The city offensive had created the event for its tenth anniversary.
It was a valuable event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the gameplay.............
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - when you put them in.
This ensures that the item page can not read anything.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3.
4. Fest '.
These are the terms that need to be encrypted.
For errats should not be here the terms, but codes.
Abwechselnd ein Spieler pro Team ist der Verschlüsseler.
He gets a code card on which maybe "3.4.2" stands.
Decrypto does not reveal the terms behind the secret film, but its encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice", "feast" and "window" - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not; because that wins the game if it succeeds twice to crack the code.
The encoder thus notifies and reads aloud: "Werfen" for the dice, "Lose" as contrast to feast; here would of course also be something like "party" possible and "Prague" because he has adapted in school and knows the window curve there.
So it goes round for round, team for team.
You don't know the terms of the item - but this can be better combined with any hint that the encoder gives there.
Perhaps mysterious, but not to be turned off the screaming should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The cryptic character of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it fairly long and in detail until they can finally.
The explanatory video under decrypto.info in the net makes it easier.
But anyone who has just started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this seeming game.
However, "Decrypto" is not as coherent as previous speakers and Genre-Primus "Codenames", which also contains an agent science to play a game less words stülpt, but much better to play in small groups.
And wem it's just about rats and not about winning points, which can also easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: man shows police Hitler's gruss and harassed guests in the pub pe
A 48-year-old man occupied the police inspection Kulmbach in the night of Saturday on Sunday twice.
It was only in the Upper Town that he showed the hit greeting of a bypassing police force, then he also fell in the Upper Town in a pub when he left guests.
After the police refused to give notice to the pilgrim, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspectorate in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must also be prosecuted for the use of codes of unconstitutional organisations.
Works Pressig was home to Schublok's bloc.
The railway factory in Pressig was the hub of the Frankenwald for decades.
1991 ended a piece of railway history.
"When Puffer reminds of Puffer, one heard it in all Pressig", Georg Dinkel remembers the history of the place and the station.
That did not encourage anyone.
The brakes and tight carriages were also quietly used.
That was pure rail.
Statements that are sensual for Dinkels's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place characterized by the railways.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-Bergstrecke to the north, which after an increase of about 220 m altitude has its crossroads in Steinbach at the forest.
In order to cope with this, earlier trains and Schubloks were needed, which had their homeland in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station station station with 21 local troops, an apprenticeship workshop, a driving and railway mastery.
"Heart was the hub that had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich of Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of career career train.
From the railway station station (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, there were also trains for the ancillary routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a human resource stock of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the track 1939 minimized already the need for train and Schublok.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 walls were taken up in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were dismantled in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we did not envisage a better use of the site, including in relation to freight transport".
At Pfingsten 1989, the railway director Nürnberg celebrated the anniversary "50 Jahre Elektrifizierung Nürnberg - Saalfeld" a pompous Bahnhofsfest in Pressig.
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the ranking station Pressig was history.
"The rankings and inhibitors learned the most difficult work in train traffic", reminds Dinkel.
Any failure would have had fatal consequences.
Why the railway station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.

The swans now have to deal with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened during the "Art and Pleasure" series at the weekend.
With great relief, the organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather, when in the open air area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach, the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened.
It takes place under the umbrella of the Tourism Association "Around Walberla" in the frame of the series "Art and enjoyment".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was shown by a large visitor's eye.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He himself has been there for the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organiser and artist alike.
Some surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he set out his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have helped shape Flyer.
Also this year there is a 70-cent special brand for art & pleasure, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn enjoyed the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was able to be won for the musical Umrahmung.
In the course of the spacious garden, the visitor is quickly aware that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playful expression.
They are made of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, visitors on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" are expected from the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, colored, playful with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes.
With the sun shining through the bush, the object acts in a fairytale and invites to linger.
From Eckental Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to spend 15 years of K & G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, in the wind moving.
On half way, Siegrid Frey has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child" from Eckental.
And at the end of the arena, Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for the Schlendern through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 albums: Singers celebrate 50th birthday festively.
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albachtener also made their displeasure air.
At least five of them.
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that, after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia", there should no longer be any Sangesleben in the district.
It has become the legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 albums from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It will be full today," said Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albachtener singer.
On the occasion of the anniversary, they were able to revive the foundations.
For years it was tradition, then there was only a break.
The traditional festivities were held on time for the 50th anniversary.

After all, the USC, with its routines, made everything clear and set the full yield in motion.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side in such a way.
That does not stop us from being genius.

If the West does not pollute in the next few weeks, they must look upwards.
A first assessment can only be made after ten, eleven parties.
On Saturday it is only after Emlichheim.
Aasee joined Essen on 14 October.

Through her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband.
On the "Traumschiff" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly talks about the series having had a codebase with her husband from Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went for ever aboard.
The series that she made her star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she was married for ten years.
"This could also have been a reason.
For I was awakened with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues took me on eye level ", told Keller in conversation with the" picture on Sunday ".
First of all, she was always only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "Traumschiff".
For now, journalists only called at Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so well, I do not know".
She considers it possible that her husband could have been envious, but "like many men, Hans also shy about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he wanted to know my fears, my weaknesses.
In other words, in good German, I understood 'how it continues to explain.
She always had the feeling that "not good enough for him to be.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which I was never in truth, even if I appeared on stage sometimes frech and courageous.
I wanted our love to be forever ".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time."
On the day before the funeral I sat this year in the garderobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why it never dressed with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at that time "as presented in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I went much too naively to love. '
The night performer, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ resort of Zurich, this time complained about the ZFF opening party.
Our Falter is not a Motte, but a little lightly shy.
And the grelle shine, into which a green carpet is baptized on the 6th fence, blends it over fee.
But it is film festival, because want to sunbathe more or less celebrities in the spotlight.
So he is on this late thunder evening above the square to make himself in the "Aquaclean-WC oasis" short.
In this way, the public toilet facility, sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the Festival: the need for a new pavilion in the Parterre is much trouble to redefine a luxurious ambience.
In this evening, however, in the Herren Oasis, there is some reason for the sky.
So out here, look at the other side of the road: Yellow guests, who have just entertained in the cinema next door at the opening film "Green Book" at the best level, celebrate like every year the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Dessen Name fits perfectly to this film festival: as you know, the works shown are from all over the world.
What do you have to do in an article about this festival not to let everything fall into the veil for its 190 partner companies.
The wrinkle binds itself a little bit around the filler, which gave him a good fee, and two bullet towers he actually steal him generously.
Drinks push each other, they dance far after midnight to live music or let DJ rhythms pretend to join each other, and rinse with Cüpli exquisite chicken.
In the Delikatessenladen in the Souterrain waits for loop of the mouth, next to the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello freshly cut, a chocolate fountain leaps.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to be working without great losses.
We must love that country!
The Falter studies the shield at the escalator: "wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
Should this be two separate instructions, he has moved to Dresscode.
But it is more a conditional-construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the budget section on the upper floor, the poultry floor features an espresso prepared cocktail called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting this brand for years, is not here in the evening..
However, there is a passing face between Lokalprominenz, Kassentisch and kitchen articles, which the observer is aware of: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character should not be far away.
And really: Immediately walks Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost like a choir crisp, through the crowd.
It is not adapted, it is not concealed, it is not recommended at most.
Especially for this reluctance, liked to be misunderstood as a narrow-mindedness, international stars of this film.

Swen Bieletzki, Coach of the Handball Verbandsligisten ASV Senden, could hardly grasp it: "So a bitter defeat".
They had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - played over large phases not bad, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we completely disappeared", the ASV trainer was annoyed.
Soon, the Hausherren, with 8: 1, also the early Auszeit, which Bieletzki had taken, did not start fruitful.
"Then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summarized the second quarter of an hour.
The delay was only two goals.
Most importantly, Senden Bester, Marius Hintze, met another time in the phase.
After the change it became even better out of visitor view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst took to 15: 15, followed by the stage changer almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Griffen the impartial into action.
Bieletzki usually guards against seeking the guilt with others.
But: The 120-second fine, which Steffen Mühlhoff kassierte, "was a joke".
LIT had laughed well and met until the end four times - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys have been fighting great, seven men at the back and they have been thrown into the empty gate again and again.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damned victory must be", says the restless servant Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).

Polls: 46% do not want Merkel to be chancellor until 2021.
After the ridges of the past few weeks, the GroKo captures several surveys.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is being critically viewed.
Berlin - The AfD has for the first time overtaken the SPD in the Emnid-Sonntagstrend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly poll of the Opinion Research Institute, the AfD puts a counter at 17%, the SPD gives a point compared to the week before and ends at 16%.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15%, the left 11 and the FDP 10%.
On Sunday ’ s federal election, the ruling parties SPD, CDU, and CSU, according to Emnid, would receive only 43% of the vote.
This means that the grand coalition has now lost the majority on Sunday ’ s question, with the exception of Allensbach, among all the major research institutes.
The governing parties consistently score 43 to 45% of the vote (Allensbach: 51%).
At the federal election in 2017, they received a combined 53.4%.
In the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, in several polls, is the second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18%.
The Greens reach voting shares of 12.5 to 17 percent.
On average, the left is 10%, FDP is 9%.
For statistical reasons, such surveys vary according to the proportion of votes, from 2 to 3% upwards and downwards.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s (CDU) support has also declined markedly since the federal election in 2017.
At the moment, only 48% of citizens find that Merkel is the judge in the Chancellor ’ s office, as the Emni poll commissioned the BamS.
Only one in two (50%), according to the poll, wants the grand coalition to hold 41% in three years to be the next regular federal election.
In another poll published on Saturday, it was clear that Merkel ’ s popularity was too high.
The Germans also judged whether Merkel should stand for the CDU presidency again in December.
47%, according to Emnid, are 44% against.
So 64% of the Union's supporters would like a candidate, 35%.
Curtain at Aldi: Reduced price to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that there are no more romantic Kennen stories in times of ink - who should talk about Putenfleisch at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast-food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates as a connoisseur's place for the great love almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced Put meat, Boxershort barrels on the Wühltisch or the favorite pudding is still in doubt a better story for later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
App Tinder stands in the reputation of being less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We have dared the test: how do women react when they are not talking about the bush in the first news?
This is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood-Lovestory-Potential then has potential when the love affair is preceded by an Aus-den-Augen-verloren-und-wiedergefunden-Plot.
If the type then also melts under the email address bio-putenfleisch @ gmx.de at his angebeteten, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the creator of this Annonce in an unknown Aldi-Filiale that she wants her dream husband, with whom she spoke briefly about the "30% reduced bio-put meat", also to be found.
For the belief in the magic of the analogue connoisseur, she deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood in any case.

Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher Auftritt des VfL Wolbeck gegen den SC Altenrhein macht Mut
There were moments in this still young season as Alois Fetsch went to court with the ropes hard.
Wortkarg gave up, the coach of the football league VfL Wolbeck, only retired (internally) in order to make sense of the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it is running again around Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrhein, in the last game time only very thin on the ascent.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We have made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen, "Fetsch praised his guys and sought each and every individual after the match, simply to say" Thank you "for so much counter-defense against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - it went out of the 4-2 almost seamlessly over in a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes in front of the balls waited.
Wolbeck had significantly more gameplay in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his turn (17), Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the lead.
Nearly the noise would have turned out to be the same as the SCA in Minute 41 two times in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerous in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed scarcely.
Schroer also arrived late after 58 minutes at a Thewes Hereingabe.
With the consent of Miles Geske, Fetsch left again missed a fresh cell engraving.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer in the 70th minute Robin Westhues accidentally, there were 18 meters in front of the guest housing an indirect release for the placeholder.
The poultry himself joined and demonstrated his vulnerability to standards.
Westhues "Ding with the right snake beat down left from the point of view of the shooter one - 1: 0 (71).
20 minutes, which should be condemned for long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the penal room unhappy to hand.
Schiedsrichter Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately showed the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Bange Minuten musste Wolbeck in der Schlussphase überstehen, ehe Geske in der 87. Minute aus 12 Metern doch noch den Siegtreffer auf dem Puschen hatte.
Perhaps it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Output situation: Four points after five days of play - the coach Adi Hütter could not reach.
Hannover 96 wanted Eintracht Frankfurt to finally provide the first home victory.

Helicopters in Kottingbrunn crasht
There was an accident in the landing field.
The four passengers were slightly injured.
On Sunday at 14 o'clock there was a drama in Kottingbrunn.
In landing a helicopter, there were turbulence, as the police confirmed against oe24.
The helicopter was captured by a wind boil, cracked on the ground and came laterally to a halt.
Immediately police, rescue and fire brigade were agreed.
With a large ban, the forces of use came up against the accident.
The AMTC emergency cancer helicopter was also called for caution.
Only slightly injured

There is only one material damage.
The four occupants were only slightly injured and could go home independently.
The exact circumstances surrounding the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigations has been investigated.
According to Feuerwehrsprecher Franz Resperger, there was a small correlation fire that could be quickly deleted.
The Allbright-Stiftung report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards.
This meant that only 8% of the boards were female on 1 September, as evidenced by the report "The power of monoculture", which was officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday, and which the German Press Agency had in advance.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will have to pass them", said Stiftungs-Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom, or Sweden, purely male leaders - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The backwardness makes German competitors less diverse, more innovative and more future-oriented compared to others.
It is another corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses in the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright-Angaben, only 6.8 percent of the stands are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8%.
At the 30 Dax companies - in recent years pioneers - stagnated the proportion of women.
Finally, 26 women were working at intervals.
"I am sure that next year the Dax companies will again recruit consistent women - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would continue to fail to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Recruiting just as many women each year for the boards would have reached a 40% share in 2023," it says in the report.
Some even make Miese: luxury cups: Which manufacturer deserves the most per car?
The best is Ferrari.
The Italians use every sold Ferrari 280,000 euros and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Large cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Whoever makes the most profit per car among the precious suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much can the luxury manufacturers pay per car they sell?
With this question, "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer has worked.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari sold 69,000 euros of operating profit - Jaguar Land Rover only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put on the car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

Manchester United is losing again, for Mourinho we are getting tired of it.
Manchester United is now losing the Premier League in the 7th round, following the blamable out of the league.
Towards West Ham United is subject to ManU 1: 3. The way the defeat is.
The scene was sensuous in the 74th minute, in which the rebirth Marko Arnautovic was shot for West Ham 3: 1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly returned to play the Red Devils.
She was born in Manchester, England, where she was in., she was, and..
This was the negative climax of a previously largely inadequate performance.
The mood is very different at Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinhos great competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an approximate 2: 0 victory.
After half an hour Raheem Sterling broke out for the home team for the first time the defence brick of the exterior holder.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the previous torch, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the table top.
Liverpool no longer Table leader
Three days after the 1: 2 defeat in the league, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1: 1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Like Cup-Aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The meeting of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only match of the game.
Shaqiri, who arrived in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah on the field, missed after 70 minutes the balance still scarce.
Besser made it Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds started the week with an impeccable record, Chelsea was not beating for the second time.
First of all, the London team of Jürgen Klopp eliminated the blues Liverpool from the table top in the Cup.
Like City, the two London City Club Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2: 0 wins.
The fans of the Gunners, who played Granit Xhaka, had to wait for the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute of a success report.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart forged a Hereingabe by Alex Iwobi unhappy into his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil, with his third season meeting for the decision.

VW ’ s core brand is missing: Parisian automobile salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Parisian Automobile Salon takes place every two years with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue, but omnipresent: the diesel scandal and the ringing for driving bans and retrofitting should not leave German car companies out of business in Paris.
In the 2018 Motor Show, the French capital will present its novelties together with the competition from all over the world this week.
The same does not really matter much.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, should nevertheless be an important issue, at least behind the glossy scenes of the trade fair stands. the. the. the. the. the. the,, the,
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and among others have their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstadt is due to enter the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Officially, both were presented.
The iNext from BMW is scheduled to start in 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3er.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented in this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in the alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good million visitors came.
In the severe earthquakes and the ensuing tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first Beben had the strength 5,9, the second the strength 7,4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, and enormous material damage arose.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke out over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims will be significantly higher.
The figures date from only Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along Sulawesis west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorrad-Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final race for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and thus responsible for the most southerly concerns of the PS-strong bikers.
Between April and September, a traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the Nordhelle house on the last Sunday of the month.
The Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, around 150 bikers came together on Sunday to commit anything but ordinary worship.
Already from 10 o'clock, the Bolids were ripped up in front of the entrance portal the church.
First of all, the Biker-Frühschoppen was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a defy curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The preaching was carried out during the Biker-Gottesdienst Pfarrer Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill was responsible for the musical underscore.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic and quiet tones of", Pfarrer Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big feast: After the apple comes the milk milk
And also in the actual day of action Borisch was active.
They prepared their hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Great interest also aroused Georg Hartmann Niemerg.
He had his apple press in the luggage and demonstrated his astonishing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann Niemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle force, a fine crushed mass has been removed from the apples.
Not many of the children could have imagined how to make a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step at this late Friday afternoon.
In forms packed and wrapped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacks a little like hardened well looking apple pipes layer for layers.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step in the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice went to and into a large vessel.
But the farmer had already finished filling specialities.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented to the older visitors the latest spring white.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents came into contact, while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press, but also the built refuge for themselves discovered.
Also active of the Füchtorfer Cameroon of former soldiers committed themselves within the framework of the festival and invited to play a few stops.
In the coming year, the Heimatverein will also offer an action day.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out, the home will not be in the heart of what is happening in the place of saving money.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the issue: after all, it will be around milk.
1: 4 gegen Frankfurt: Hannover mit vierter Saison-Pleite: "Beschissene Situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, trainer André Breitenreiter assembled his disappointed professionals from Hanover 96 to speak to them courage.
There were many positive things before: 1: 4 (0: 2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt, however, did not see.
"It is a grim situation, but you have to go out as a team," said 96-soccer professional Pirmin Schwegler and shoved: "This is obviously disappointing, because you always take a lot".
The farcical Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met, has two meters downwards and is a candidate for descent in its current constitution.
On the other hand, Angeführt of the surprising Ante Rebic celebrated the first season home victory in Frankfurt.
In the 36th minute, Rebic (451 + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) before 46,300 spectators reached the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general test for the European League game against Lazio Rome, proposed seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia ’ s Vice World Champion Rebic was almost involved in any dangerous offensive of the Hessen in his debut debut, and never got to grips with Hanover ’ s defense.
After the World Cup, the shocking stormer showed with his pace and perseverance why he is so valuable for the harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurt, the Brazilian Allan fled from the FC Liverpool.
A tornet of falsified headball from Lucas Torró (17) was first put at risk.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller became richer at the last moment in Brazil ’ s 96-defense, which replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leaders of the Hausherren were almost inevitably and utterly deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a fenced corner in the penal hall, he extended his head in front of the gate where Ndicka only needed to keep the foot..
It was the first Bundesligatreffer for the defender players who had been taken from the French second league AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt still took a break.
This time, Haller adapted to his Sturmpartner Rebic, who had not had any chance of winning through and 96-Torwart Michael Esser.
In the mid-term Hanover Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak idea of his elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a bit bolder now, but soon before the end of ideas, when the connection buffer was still available.
Hessen was far more efficient.
After a tight hour Rebic started a solo and then put right on De Guzmán, who had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only show run for the Frankfurt guests, Jovic also met one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes the party mile
Despite cool temperatures, the atmosphere in the Oktoberfest was good.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter created Millionenpublikum at the opening of 185.

Geisingen: Geisinger Christen feiern Heilig-Kreuz-Fest est
The violinist Katholiken celebrates the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or on Sunday afterwards.
The Festgottesdienst takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Heilig-Kreuz-Kirche with the final.
The Holy Cross Church houses the story of Christ, which dates from the Thirty Years ’ War and is to be shot on the legend after a Swedish soldier.
The blood flowed out of the shot.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shouted Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished to this day, only the old tree stands, the missing longhouse is hinted by the trees.
In his preaching, Pfarrer reminded Adolf Buhl that the cross was a sign of hope, of comfort and of life.
The service of God was poorly attended despite the importance of the violinist Pfarrei.
After the service of God, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and ended with the closing blessing of the church part of the Cross.
For many years the Catholic Church choir has been inviting to the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish.
The choir members sent visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon the parish congregations still offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid Seger informed the visitors about the damage to facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will be dragging into the next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be more accurately identified and the individual tenders could be made more concrete.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that has already been done a few years ago has increased, but more has also been said about what was possible only through the use of scaffolding.
The socket plaster beits are finished, before the winter is to be started with the natural stone work and one hopes to finish half of this work this year.
inauguration: Neues Wohnheim in der Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße a very special house will now be handed over to his determination - all those present agreed on the objections.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have already been living in the home of the Donau-Iller living for some time now rely on the special architecture of the new building.
Broader corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was put on the test bench for the inhabitants with Handycap: "The house had come into the years and no longer timed according to the equipment", said Bader retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators crashed around the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel at ease.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new residential home in Iller......... the. the
Around EUR 4.6 million was invested in new construction.
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million, the district gave EUR 450000.
According to the architect Bader, the building works have remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms.
He also thanked the Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The gap between a barrier-free construction and, at the same time, refractory construction was not always easy.
However, the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many requirements that the inhabitants of freedom had to experience without being able to move outside help.
Similarly, the head of the district ’ s social administration, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: “The house is geared to the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile. ”
In doing so, housing and functionality have been combined well, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The plot in this situation is a real lucky event because it is so in today's situation no longer to acquire".
Altogether, the new residential home in the Münsterblickstraße is located on almost 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three living groups.
The life aid manager Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by collective bargaining.
Germany: Swede laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to deal with the disadvantages of East German.
There are differences that are painful after almost 30 years of unity.
With these differences, we must not be satisfied, "said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Sunday.
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that, on average, East Germany worked longer than the people of West Germany, but 15% were less salary.
"I can explain this almost 30 years after German unity no one," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Will this putty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan hunting and is supposed to smooth the Wogen between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang gave South Korean President Moon Jae two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs a gift.
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday, the two dogs reached their recipients about a year ago on Thursday.
They therefore passive the border town of Panmunjom, together with three kilograms of dog food, in order to facilitate the animals' reconciliation '.
The dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
Kim Jong-un, North Korea ’ s leader, announced in Pyongyang in mid-September that the North had given the Moon and North Korea a third summit this year.
Both countries also agreed to join together in international sporting competitions, such as the 2020 Olympic Games, and jointly bid to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile drives.
Austria ’ s Moved History in Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months, numerous new books have been published that answer this question mostly in retrospect to the last hundred years.
In a very different way, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it in the splendid "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be released on October 1.
New Week, New Chance for the Government
Back to substantive work - that is the unofficial slogan for today ’ s emerging Great Coalition working week.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her CDU ministers, SPD and also CSU last summoned the "return to the subject matter".
This may be the case for some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other active citizens in this country who are entitled to question what is actually the difference between work and material work, but whether it is' s drum.
If the federal government is now ready to return to its mandate - to govern - then it should not be discouraged from debating terms.
Whether the Union and the SPD can really do something together after the provocations and bubbles of the last few weeks is likely to show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties come together to form a coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round on a regular basis to defuse conflicts at an early stage; a lesson from all the quarrels... the the. the. the. the.
First of all, however, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with the Diesel retrofit and the specialist immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with exchange-rate premiums on a shrinking basis, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the duty to retrofit older diesel.
While a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned law on skilled workers.
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the 'change of track' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be a row again among coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal has coalesced together, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society that is so diverse, sometimes contradictory, is not making progress.
However, in order to be constructive, there must be no question of his or her disagreement for party-political reasons.
We are still talking about politics, not theatre.
The Union and SPD are supposed to strike - but always have a view of the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key issue, both the diesel and the track change issue can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, the grass-roots parties must fight now.
Pilz reviews working hours at Hartinger
Minister in Visier
Does the Minister of Labour, in particular, violate the law of service in force?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" would have worked their legists on the social security reform, reported a manageable Social Minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) has said that she is bringing the matter to Parliament via question.
They assume that 'the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and certainly did not want to proclaim offences against the right of service before running cameras'.
Nevertheless, they are now asking questions to free Har ­ tinger from any suspicion.
Police Strip for Women's Equality
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to comment on this.
There is now confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is being excavated.
The route is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was anticipated that the investigators had previously used an archaeologist.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, was finally able to limit the relevant place to a few metres in the multi-color application.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Monument Protection Agency, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said street property.
For more than a year now, prosecutors and criminals have been forgiving the offence.
Marxgrün has repeatedly been locked off a cycle path and investigated with sonars, because the investigators suspect that this could have been squandered in the course of rebuilding the state road 30 years ago Heike ’ s body.
Colour powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be the first time.
But it is already coming to crafts.
The separatists did not forget the police operation in the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of 1 October 2017, the Barcelona Center met with clashes between separatists and the police.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, with colour powders, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honour their colleagues with a rally that was illegal last year in the referendum in the polling stations.
In trying to prevent citizens from voting, violence also occurred at the time.. the. the the. the the the the. the. the
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the 6000 separatists would then have tried to break the police chain, and the officials, among other things, exploded with colour bags and eggs.
Six people have been arrested, 24 more have been easily injured, and they have been referred to by the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under forced government in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians, too, went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in U-prisons.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was ended.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the 'right to self-determination' of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Versammelte Ratlosigkeit: FC Gütersloh und RW Ahlen trennen sich torlos los Ahlen
Rot White Ahlen continues on the spot.
Even with the FC Gütersloh, it was enough to achieve a 0: 0 score.
The final light and the third last puppted them in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as assembled helplessness.
The first half was overshadowed by the entertainment factor.
Those who would prefer to pick up a beer or a bratwurst could do so without concern.
There was not a danger of missing a torchance, because there were virtually no.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) shot of the entire lot, Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility was the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling, after 32 minutes with a shot from the penal border to a parade.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was early change.
He had to be exchanged for the cause of injury by Stürmer Lars Schröder, who came to Aygün for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel came out of 18 meters just above the housing and after an hour the freight sloh also appeared offensive for the first time.
After a ballet by Matthäus Wieckowicz it went fix.
The swift presentation of Konter about Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62nd) with a black shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they laid a headball from Wieckowicz (66th) to a corner ball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interimstrainer Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
There was nothing wrong.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative did not bring about the Ahlenians.
Only in the 91st minute had Cihan Yilmaz the last chance, but also the brought nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: 'I like we have played out at zero', but unfortunately the zero was also on the front.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against wood processing and although our opponent had no desire to play here," said RW Ahlens Interimstrainer.
Apparently, "everything pledged so a bit" against a team, "which only wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not feel that we could get a counter-war ", says Daut.
But his body was not perceived as a spectator, as if his team were shooting a goal.
For that, the idea was too meagre.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Luckily there are enough chalks for the lucky ones.
The Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended.
The Honorary Insurance: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld as well". the. the. the the the. the. the.
Opening showed the sky shining blue, but the place was still empty, but that should change over the day.
This is because it is so nice to be here today, 'said a visitor.
The organizer of the Festes Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper priest Humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who should be wounded against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there is enough chalk.
And the "replacement" did not let it take to entertain more and more visitors by musically.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Easy toll", Marcel Kreimer was delighted.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to bring the opening date of this time to his schedule.
He is pleased with the many activities with her booths, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a table at all," he thanked for the action of the male chore.
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those involved in the booths and included the other festivities that took place in September and the Clean up action.
Our garden town has a colorful painting - here's what goes.
Then the Maikranz was taken off by Georg Knorr and Gerd pieces with the help of the fire brigade and brought into the winter quarter.
Many booths have been used for the good of women.
From sweetness to heart was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, was creative in his decoration coffins.
Furniquette, beer-cover with reckening fields motifs and some more he had in offer.
A speciality offered three beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter still has a speciality.
Honey cake in glass, naturally with honey from my own production.
As the little Elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cake.
The conviviality is that the visitors then spend a long time in the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Schmierereien mit lokalpolitischer Botschaft: Keine gelungene Werbung für Skateanlage
In Lengerich, unknown people have hardly promoted the construction of a skateboard.
At several locations there are corresponding lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been accused of material damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are denounced on signs among others at the Gempt-Halle and Alten Rathaus.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that an appropriate font was discovered at the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro after the trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an Edding, they can easily be removed.
"Only a few days later, this time it stood up again," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the advertisement has to be replaced.
A special note is given in this case by the fact that several large companies are also called Lengerich on the board.
If the skateboard is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
Commitments already exist, explains Jörg Hesselmann of the urban field of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
Good possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the coated table.
Local politics and administration have been involved in the topic of skateboarding for years.
After the old LWL clinic had been dismantled, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
After all, the Council was in favour of a majority in the fire service park..
This inward approach has not been implemented - too many factors seem to have been opposed to the construction of this post.
At the end of June, a U-turn followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the Areal of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says on the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word was then taken by the city council.
He will take a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built by 2019.
Closer air traffic control is getting worse.
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm," said the head of the trade union of air traffic control, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
One important reason for the many delays and flight failures is the long-established personnel shortage in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europaweit sei der Markt für fertig ausgebildete Lotsen leergefegt.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, around a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city on Friday, representatives of the Federal Government, the countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports come together to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, this will not go without us," the head of the GdF, who has many members in Germany's own Deutsche Flugsicherung.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the Lotsen-Misere.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost reductions and personnel savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully integrated into the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for rules that do not keep air safe.
At the moment, the EU ’ s targets would be agreed by 2024, and there are grounds for fear of further tightening.
The EU is under constant pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair Chef Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high cost of delays in the airlines will lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
The record of 120 lottery surfers each year, announced so far, over the next five years, has just been enough to offset the age-related declines.
The necessary staff building is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group umbau
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the Group's restructuring plans.
Following the will of Thyssenkrupp-Interimschef Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group will be split into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff reductions beyond the already known cuts in administration.

The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include among other things the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and subcontracting.
Barcelona: Violence at demos of policemen and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona gave rise to violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the municipal administration, around 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence demonstrators.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests apart with a large ban.
According to pro-independence forces, however, repeated attempts to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officials with paint and sausages.
According to the figures, there were also rankings between the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The policemen wanted to pay tribute to their demonstration, which almost exactly one year ago preceded the Catalan independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Spanish police and civil security officials find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn far more than they earn.
The demonstrators perceived it as provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they have rushed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman of the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the charge.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year only did their duty: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because that is a great European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues did not come to provoke ", the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security gap in a mobile phone app has meant that the personal data of ministers and members of the Conservative British Tory Party were temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the pans became known a day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.

And Ronaldo did the preparatory work for the meeting of Abwehrchef Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had to move just before the Torlinie.
"He gives many templates", praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see Tore from the attacker who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record team.
"We need to be even better at serving him," said the coach.
Bester Juve-Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than EUR 100 million, the raison d'être of Juventus seems to be becoming even more.
Seventh victories in seven games is the spotless series in the series A. At 21 points, the master of the past seven years already has six meters ahead of Naples.
The second table that was trained by former Bavarian coach Carlo Ancelotti was not without chance against Turin.
But, no later than after Mario Rui (58), who had already rejected the plateau, the top part was determined.

"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turiner Coach.
Emre Can also feel at ease.
The German national player won Juve.
The Profi, which was acquired by FC Liverpool, was used by all seven leagues.
The midfielder also played in the Champions- League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo was in second: 0-victory of the Turiner from the place and is closed for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.

"I think" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you ", so the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
That is all!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply griffiger, we have never put him as good as ever before problems ".
Grade times two Torchancen in 90 minutes, so that only rarely make games positive.
Football club A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first pass, but the first took advantage of Maik Krause from a pointed angle to the early leadership (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preliminary work by Krause he got free standing.
The host had only a double chance when Moritz Höne first broke at Torsteher Jos shoemakers and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests were even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all donated.
A trader - Louis Kortenjann had rescued the Torlinie with his hand and saw Rot for it - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use for the guests (75.).
It was not until Nils Berheide made the ball over the line, that the game was decided (81st).

"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We didn't get access to it at all," said Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, presumably all the other green whites that appeared with collective revenge.
He was able to laugh anyway: "A dreadful victory," he said, still compelled french and pulled by dancing ropes players, however, was the relief to note that they had drawn with three points from the affair.
Mind you, after a duel of two teams, one of which, Albachten, plays around the championship and the other, Albersloh, fighting for the brass stop.
With understandably mixed feelings GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance", he says.
"As we come back to the 0: 2, as we consider the whole game time against one of the top teams of the league against, this was really phenomenal.
This is how bitter it is that you have to drive home with empty hands.
Top Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the host with his 12th season meeting in leadership (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2: 0 he put on the left side mustergültig to Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but so a player can't be completely smoked.
"This was already madness, which has made" Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent without tendencies.
Shortly before the side change, his own elf managed to compensate: McGill's release of left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia Torhüter Hinkerohe through to the long Toreck (45.).
After the side change, it was again McGill, who achieved the balance (59).
Then it went and it went.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69th).
In spite of the number of visitors, Albersloh was unable to re-register the last Concordia meeting (80.).
We must now focus fully on Wednesday.
"The game against apes, this is what we must win now," said Lewandowski.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominente guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until mid-next year.
Meanwhile, France ’ s president, Emmanuel Macron, has signaled that he will personally seek the tolerance price in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as president, he was not in Tutzing ’ s Gospel Academy.
But before and afterwards Wulff was a guest there.
As a result, Akademiedirektor Udo Hahn, as he proudly said, "All the Federal President and Chancellor were already with us".

Musikkabarett: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Both for adults and for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As cabaret stars, men understood gender, not only with humour and warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man, and what else may there be, but also with music.
The mini guitar set her and mastered her violin.
On the wings sat Ben Süverkrüp.
The first is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the end of the sentence, and the other is a true pianist: so congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
This was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, as was the case with the Red Fades in the evening.
As Teubner had brought a paradox into play: satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner, but it doesn ’ t open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The Klavier-Solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have been the result of the composer Mozart's performance, "Nannerl" would have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrüp slides into improvisations, from Bachs "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" in das "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart g-Moll-Symphonie into a playful dancing.
There were big applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers covered Karlheinz Kleintje, Treasurer of the Association, the Chansonette.
But Heidemarie Markenbeck ’ s chairman did not allow himself an additional thank.
She had the idea to treat the duo alongside appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as a woobeck.

Handball: Damen-Landesliga: Ahlener SG reserves against TV Wattenscheid the white west.
The Ahlenerinnen had problems especially with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who marked the ten hits alone.
"Actually I was satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We did not get to grips with it, "says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
The anger, however, increased over the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the end was missing his team this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the conclusion of a backlog, was behind for a break with 11: 12 and later with 15: 18 (45.).
It was only at the end that the broader bank of hosts made a decisive difference.
In addition, Aydogdu put back the Merle Clement on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).

It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
This is what we have been working on, and the coaching coach Dominik Münch, after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the spiced table leader.
The first passage dominated the guests almost at will.
About 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 he went with 25: 15 to the viceroy of the previous year.
Eating has been accepted in the branch, but has not come into play.
We have done it well.
Our opponent has taken a high risk but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence the BSV introduced with 12: 8. "Essen has changed the assumption to a triangle.
We could not keep the pressure on.
Eating has been blessed, and we have allowed ourselves a bit of a cake, "says Münch.

It is true that in the 19: 24, Ostbevern was still four saddle elves, but the fifth attempt was made.
"The game was now a class better", the training manager was at the level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV applied the leaf in the third section of 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "We have played consistently and calmly".
About 7: 3 and 15: 13 brought the blue whites through four with 25: 22 to their side.

International: Turkish Municipality: Mosque Opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the great Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The mosque reddish in Cologne has left a shambles in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be painstakingly summarised," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of supporting German leaders in emphasizing Muslim membership in Germany, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The extensive exclusion of the German public encouraged 'many reservations'.
Homeland club Nottuln: Offer has already established itself.
After the long summer break, Folktreff-Zeit is back.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m. the Nottuln Homeland Society is already hosting its fifth Nottular Folktreff in the Chamber Room of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost on the day exactly it is then a year ago that we conducted a Folktreff for the first time.
Since then, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatvereins.
I would not have thought that our folktreff would have been so quick in Nottuln eta ­ bliert.
No matter if Sturmtief Friederike was busy in January or heatwave in July, the Amtmannei fireplace room was always full.
"The program at the next Folktreff is like always a colourful mixture of German folk, hikers and sailors, folk songs, evergreens and old drums," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invited friendly musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer gave his accordion to the first Folktreff birthday.
He was a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group of his neighbours Steinfurt who played music with German texts.
Now he is travelling with an Irish Folk Band.
Gern remembers the makers of the Folktreffs at the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht", enthused the listeners and with an ear worm, sent home.

China approved the planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October.
Frankfurt Linde and Praxair are taking another step forward on the way to the world ’ s largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority approved the planned merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This makes it even more difficult for the millions of people involved to obtain authorisations in South Korea and, as the biggest hurdle, in the United States.
Most recently, they had improved the chances of agreeing an insider, because Linde promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October, so that the merger can be achieved.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the Kreisverbands was celebrated for horticulture and preservation of the land.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus was set up for the district association for horticulture and nursing in Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
In 1893 Wilhelm Flessa was born in Taufe.
The purpose of the fruit tree was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit growing, about flowers and horticulture no one thought at that time.
"At that time, in the era of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of elites," explained Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his presentation.
Fruit trees should be cleared from long-distance roads, so called industrial gardens in schools.
Today, fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But that is far from exhausted.
Natural gardening, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as mediating knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer Jugendgruppe "Maulwürfe" show how versatile the tasks of a garden building association are on the stage.
"The youth work is urgently needed especially in the digital age," said the circle chairman Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The chestnut boxes were a giant matter for us children, I doubt that smartphone & Co., you a lot.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner.
"Where the stand shall be, the district association decides", supplemented Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of the garden associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county is also a cause of doubt for business leaders and expert advisers Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with an image presentation through the long history of the district and reported among other things the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came from the garden, for the winter it was dosed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has endured, it was there before us and we must orient ourselves to it", the expert advocated for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is no reason for the horticultural associations to make the spur, so that our homeland can remain beautiful and worth living.
These included welcoming the new citizens in our clubs, supplemented by the President of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif graduated from the festival act, which was solemnly framed by the tower blocks of the music association Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada ’ s Secretary of State is making UN speech
Mexico ’ s government wants clarity about Nafta: they are putting a ultimatum to both trading partners for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister is now giving absolute priority to the trade agreement - and is postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Due to pressure of time in the struggle for a rebalancing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the ministers will speak to the United Nations General Assembly only on Monday, their spokesman, Adam Austen, said.
In the meantime, they focused on renegotiating Nafta.
The Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, said on Friday that Canada ’ s negotiators and the US would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the US-US trade agreement.
The US and Mexico agreed to recast the Nafta regional free-trade agreement in August.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new situation have been going on for over a year.
Until Sunday evening (local time), they are now to be brought to a close, Trump ’ s government wants to present the deal before October 1.
In the event of a breakdown in the negotiations, Mexico ’ s President-designate, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday to seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, attacked the hospital at a trade fair.
The far-right military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro after a report of the newspaper "O Globo", where he lives.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public performances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
Politicians were attacked more openly in southern Brazil at the beginning of September during an election campaign.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, the associations also made statements against Bolsonaros racist and frauenverachtende.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In Brazil ’ s capital, protests were mixed with a presidential rally by the Brazilian Workers ’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and therefore cannot stand for election.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As former mayor of São Paulo ’ s Millionenstadt, Haddad has been far behind the far-right candidate, Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brasiliens" may have been in politics for a long time, but is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
None of the candidates in the first round of elections suffices for the absolute majority; there is a run-off on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from it - no matter who he takes.
Bolsonaro is well known for fighting homosexuals and blacks, and for the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Time and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that Lula's supporters should be shot down by left-wing workers.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen informed Larsen website.
On the death bed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children.

After the sound check and just before the concert start, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands lautstark excited about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with Frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows about the recording of the concert table with the latest, unknown pieces from their own spring and the upcoming CD.
Before the stage, the band will be dancing at the show for a coherent and impressive interplay.

The fact that Hardrock is not the same hardrock, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with her alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", a synthesizer is also used at "Here We Stand".

Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also plays with the band in the single cover song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, very own accents.
For the more sophisticated sound than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheerful solo, and he runs through audiences.

This is about at Presslufthammerniveau, but it is still well below the excise duties of the "Wacken-Fesitvals", to point to the "The Ignition" on their website.
Ohre stunned 120 decibels in Düsentrieblautstärke as usual at the annual Metal-Stelldichein in the north of the Republic, the Ahlener audience does not need to eat at this rock night.
After just four hours, the three bands of the hardened, rocky Gangart have long convinced with their sovereign virtuoso game and their own compositions.

Trump joins Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the US president, North Korea ’ s leader, Kim, is well disposed of despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
Now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with kims "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president became known as a new flame.
The tragedy is a distant relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Saturday.
Prior to supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost angry words for the half-old Spross of the dynasty of Pyongyang, even though the North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament is proving to be quite tough.
"I was tough, he was, and between us it went and her," Trump reported.
And then we left.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the talks with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote to me wonderful letters, great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the nuclear-missile test announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
The fact that the affection for the “Rocket Man ” – so Trump ’ s nickname for Kim – that his martial throat was not likely to be in any way likely to be well aware of the US president.
In any case, he criticized his appearance in a large sports hall of the city of Wheeling in the same way: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How terrible is that?
That is so unpretentious.
He took care of that, but said very little, Trump and then directed his finger at the crowd: "I always told you it is so easy to be presidential".
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there in this prall filled arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler.
Baesweiler Bestens visits, atmospheric as well as soothing from the sun: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler ’ s city centre was cleaned out on Sunday.

Refugees Liberated from Libyan Prison
Nigerian refugees, using a mobile phone video, have referred to their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya, enabling them to be rescued.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under threat of life and circulated online.
"You refuse to return us," said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the site "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we would probably not have been able to return to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he got his own message in danger of life.
One of his comrades was beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
Generally speaking, the conditions of detention have been catastrophic: "They swallow us all with tubes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from Latrine.
IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homeland this year, using the program, the IOM spokesman said in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of Nigerians now rescued, with a view to the poor prison conditions in Libya, is not exceptional.
From a Hilferuf via mobile video he has not heard so far.
International organizations have long criticized conditions in Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the road from Africa to Europe.

Laschet exhorts the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has called for his own rule of law in Turkey.
The relations of the two countries are currently 'overshadowed', said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns, in particular, waves of arrest, freedom of the press and religion.
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important precondition for this.
Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey..,, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then reiterated the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The discussion between Laschet and Erdogan was transferred to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense ’ s readiness to fly at Cologne Airport in the short term.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Wahn Castle, but the owners of the castle had rejected Erdogan out of political conviction.
Erdogan went on to discuss the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
He said, 'The Muslims who go to these mosques are also citizens of our country'.
And we are also their contact point - and not the Turkish President.
Missing Confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the successes of the negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is the sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a clash of Washington.
North Korea ’ s Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula during the UN General Debate.
"The recent stalemate is that the US is building on coercive measures that are lethal for confidence building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we disarm ourselves as the first" North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that punitive measures could force North Korea on its knees is a pipe dream of people who do not know us.
But, in order to build trust, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, hob Ri.
On the US side, however, there have been no 'appropriate reactions', the Minister criticised.
Because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, last year alone, the United Nations Security Council adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have been striving for punitive measures over the past few days at the United Nations.
At the same time, the US government is working toward rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea ’ s leader, Kim Jong-un, for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is expected to return to talks about ending North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons program after Pyongyang.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community.
The fact that they found themselves in a youth meeting, the many visitors from the house of the open door HoT did not complain: white blankets and flower muck on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the harvest dance service.
The young people of the HoT were enchanted by the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
Financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank Essen.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were prepared for the great day.
But then came the bad surprise on the first day after the summer break: a power outage had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the front: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to create it alone", says Westbuer.
And so all packed with.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Better it can not cook," praised a visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests served at Quiche, liver cheese or cake served.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on the legs", said Pfarrer Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other art pieces for astonishment.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW state of the table.
From frustration with criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, gave his post in the National Association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a freeze for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice Chairman of the NRW Table, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I like too many in my back.
The head of the National Tafeln Association NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed sympathy with the dpa for the decision of his longtime deputy.
The sharp criticism was taken by Sartor.
"I can understand his move - people who didn't know exactly why the food table makes it.
Sartor is still active for the food table - "six days the week, there is nothing changing", says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized in the "world on Sunday" again criticism of colleagues from other tablets.
We should not take the approach 'without starving the people of the city'.
It is up to the state to ensure that people do not starve.
At a conference of the Tafeln on Friday in Berlin, the Essen did not take part.
"As I am told too much sweet smuggling," he said.
As they are all social fuzzis, which I criticised at the time.

Pleite bei Hertha: Von der Realität eingeholt: Bayern gegen Ajax gefordert
In the meantime, the prevalence is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not mean that the FC Bayern wants to fall.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach will now determine the first intermediate step for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance delle under the new Coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase for the Münchner in any way to the larger autumn depths.
"A week ago we still had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we have caught up with reality, "said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0: 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that we are getting angry about this and that is why we are giving gas for Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year, no own goal has been scored, as at the same time the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory, the table running in the football league first lost to Borussia Dortmund.
While the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti in late September 2017, the recorder must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its intensive team counterpart tactics and the Berlin through their playful needle sticks over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the most powerful Bavarian ones are cracking.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we are not happy with this and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," said Kovac.
He was also surprised by his losers in his native city, however, and defeated his first defeat as Munich's coach only for the once again defective handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would be a positive one before the country recess - otherwise the tone may be tightened.
So Kovac did not take exceptional measures before this season's second class appearance after 2: 0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday starts as planned the short preparation for the second prelude against Ajax, which had also been forced on the prelude to the prelude AEK Athens sovereign with 3: 0.
"Now we caught in two games, but we will also make our gates again", announced national team capitals Manuel Neuer.
As before after the lost cup finals against Eintracht Frankfurt spoke at the same place especially Joshua Kimmich Klartext.
The defender of the law played a role as a reminder.
"I do not believe that all this is bad, we also have to work out it again because we do not make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes", said the 23-year-old just before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bavaria even had five meters behind Dortmund, which has now taken the again with.
And so I was at least positive with an eye compulsion that the public debate over the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, this is already good," said the national player.
It is good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Schusslinie: Özil-Causa: Scharfe Attacke von Erdogan an Grindel del
The Turkish President, Mr Erdogan, denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious accusations.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but never defends the verbandslinie.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the clearance of the continuous ice hema Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President criticized Germany for opening the great Ditib-Mosque in Cologne for dealing with the former world champion, the DFB boss defended the ban.
At the early Sunday morning, Özil personally strongly attacked Grindel at the Mainzer ZDF- "Sportstudio" consequences from the Causa.
"Since we must draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with immigrant background in U-teams - that something like this does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as a further envoy of integration.
At the same time, Grindel once again declared that Erdogan was not in favour of the values of football and the DFB.
This was denounced in harsh terms by racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German born and growing Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they could take pictures with me in England, "said Erdogan on Saturday in the Domstadt.
To be honest, I could not digest it as your President that our two young men who went up to the German national team were excluded.
Grindel pointed out in Gündogan that, unlike Özil after the World Cup affair, which had taken its beginning through photos of the two with Erdogan, "sensibly treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says: When I win, I am German when I fall in love, I am immigrant - that is not possible.
"That he has such an impression, I regret very", said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, as I have always said.
A basis for a return of Özils to the national team does not see him either.
In addition to the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, a new integration representative is to be appointed.
"If there is a clear impact on society and football without an immigrant background, saying:" The issue is important because we have to look after ourselves ", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work," said Grindel.
In spite of the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again next year for the post as DFB president.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes," said Grindel.
Thirty-three accidents within three hours of age are being caused.

This was mentioned, and the man did not want a police force on the ground and then went there.
After that, the Romans went home.
However, the pensioner has been living in his place of residence where he has been living for decades, and when he is turning a building vehicle.
After all, the police could find and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.

"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental looting of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry exactly like heterosexual marriage.
Prior to that, they had been able to enter their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with regard to the right to adopt.

In Macedonia, the awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters should decide whether their state should be called in the future of northern Macedonia.

Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stress situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be taken with the express consent of Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland launches an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
The aim is to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved in the case of Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs can continue to be taken with the express consent of Swisstransplant, as in Germany.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases a card is found at the decisive moment in possible donors.
More than 60% of the talks do not know the relatives of the deceased.
"They then have to decide in the sense of the deceased, which is often very onerous", says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations of storing data on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesman for the Federal Health Enlightenment, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - per or contracted organ donation - there is not", she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, it would initially be regarded as a donor, unless he or she contradicts family members.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.

Grüß was already in Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year old.
With terms like superhirn, genius or miracle child, organizer Laue can start little.
"Kopfrechnen lässt sich trainieren", he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even arithmetic competitions in stadiums.
Among the disciplines, for example, the square root is drawn from six-figure figures.
The candidates are expected to have surprises when it comes to their ability to implement a solution strategy quickly.
Here, the Germans would also have a good chance, said the main judge.

Were you yourself on the spot during the tsunami?
No, I was at the time just in Jakarta on the island Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
As I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be imported.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Also our office of "World Vision" is destroyed, but we have set up something provisionally where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are eagerly awaited on surrounding hills, where they still endure fear of another tsunami and earthquakes, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are keeping their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the petrol stations are completely closed, people smile partially food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down, and the national government is helping.
A prison has also been destroyed, the detainees are sometimes free to walk around and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many corpses around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information services run on the island?
At the moment we have shrinking hands, but before that, it did not work and we received information only over radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who do not know whether they live and where they are, because people were on work during the earthquakes, not at home, but for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information on this?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the waiver came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they were banished to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Firering, not prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but that was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuation.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit very many people.

Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With a FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the thin majority for the contentious candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been contested for the Nötigungsvorwürfen.

Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated against Mainz the first season victory.
The relief on shawl is great after the first season victory.
However, Mainz also played a role against the factor time.
Gelsenkirchen - It is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball inside.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penal room, "said the sports stand of Schalke 04 - and atmete.
After all, the Königsblauen was still able to bring the scarce 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first season victory under the roof and expert.
It could have been otherwise.
After the leadership of Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of chief trainer Domenico Tedesco had given security Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and Pressing her".
Don ’ t Create a Headball Untax
"The last ten minutes have felt for me like two hours," Heidel said: "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand that".
The boys were afraid to give them out of their hands, and so they moved on.
And with man and mouse against Mainz defends.
To save the first three meters of the season.

Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to tackle parties over 90 minutes.
Perhaps the biggest shortcoming in the afternoon: Royal blue missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry.
The possibilities were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, which twice met the Latte 59th / 72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have become a quotation", said Tedesco: "You have felt the fear a bit".
I am therefore glad that we have won.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on eye level
Before them is the author, Professor Doktor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has once again followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my job to get interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" in the orientation of the evening.
El-Mafaalani rises very loosely in the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject clearly.
With a lot of gesture, solid figures and one or other joke, he brings the listeners one of the most conflicting themes closer: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are increasingly conflicts arising?
The most Syrian author uses metaphor to answer the question.
On a table, the German society, at the catchphrase, sits the first generation migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit around the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to co-determine.
That leads to conflict.
Therefore, it is not crucial whether we should be politically right-wing or left-wing, but rather: 'I am in favour of or against an open society?', he stresses.
Initially rather behave, he always runs the discussion round.
And there is a need for speech.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell us how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with pupils.
El-Mafaalani is not on stage, a reflection of the meaning of the discussion: she is on eye level.
The sociology professor does not insist on his opinion that he speaks of the average, not individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because 'only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions', says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing of the Signing Hour, he has an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, where prepared Kurdish specialities, was discussed intensively.

Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues, for the third time in a row, had not changed to the Schalker Startelf, but to the Auswechselbank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the almost two meters big Brazilians had been so right the frustration of the soul.

It is important that everyone is able to go through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation, which last also Naldo caught.
And to the Brazilians, with the wisdom of his advanced age, he reacted to the Bank as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria ’ s industry accelerated its downturn compared to the eurozone in August.
The shopping managerindex (PMI) lay deep with 46.7 points on a 37-month low.
In spite of this, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands to share the Markit Institute on Monday with its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone ’ s PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the mark of 50 meters, implying growth.
There were 50.9 points in Ireland's industry in August.
Finally, the Greeks were (42.1 points).
In Germany, France, and Spain, the mood barometer sank, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"While the slightly weakened downturn may mean that the worst has survived," Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
But industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: the eurozone ’ s export orders fell as much as they did since November 2011.
The companies therefore built the seventh month in succession posts.
In China, too, industrial production declined more than initially in August.
The scoreboard sank from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing managerindex supports its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
