DFB-Chef Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback.
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that one talks to him about why one or two of them seems to have felt this way, as stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmowers" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the debate over the photographs of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for months, he deplores the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have liked Mesut Özil to continue playing for Germany.
I also thought at some point that this would be the case, "said Grindel.
In July, De 29 year olds explained his resignation from the DFB team and justified it by the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and Team Manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "you leave a team or change an association, you talk about it with his trainer and I think it is a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned.
At 2.13 p.m. the occupational fire rifle Linz was alarmed at a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage power line leads directly through the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in default.
The professional fire rifle crashed and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be virtually completely removed and fireplaces had to be removed to an absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery inserted for lunch.
This may be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined, as must the cause of the fire.
It should be considerable, however, because the owner had many collectors ’ items in his garden hut.
Wonderful mother defends himself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee families on open streets.
What has Lindsay Lohan only driven to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to take away children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself stepped up live as she apparently wants to take away children from a family in Moscow.
The report reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial section of the streams.
Here you can see "Luckily cooked" with Lindsay Lohan.
The clip shows how Lohan exits from a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family fled from the actress, Lohan pursued the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of trafficking in children.
For all this, it does not provide evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this just", Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to follow the family road.
Apparently she tries to separate children from her parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks as if she turns around and Lohan misses a slap.
Under tears, the actress affirms how shocked she is - and she keeps the cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.

Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned.
"The Diesel task force still exists", said development director Peter Mertens in the "Automobile Week" section.
In December 2017, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / gearbox combinations are expected to be tested", he said at.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mertens now said: 'At the beginning of July, we achieved an important stage target in the review of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was established in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandals at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer made 'serious organisational changes' so that such a scandal never happens again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler's future and intends to discuss further this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities are accusing the Audi chief of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after acquisitions of exhaust fraud.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At present, Bram Schot is managing the company as Head of Commissary Management.
Due to the conversion to the new exhaust and excise test standard WLTP there are production failures at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronner voice".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the A6, A7 and A8 Audi models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment in itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations were made.
Grindel is seeking re-election - Lahm is to become the DFB Bureau.
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, wants to run again for the post as DFB president next year.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes," said Grindel as guest on the early Sunday morning at the "Current Sports Studio" of the ZDF.
We must always strive for re-election, and I will do so.
And then you have to check if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it strange, according to his own words, if he did not want to work on the project for the future after the bid for the Euro 2024.
Grindel has served as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who overthrew the summer fairy tale affair since April 2016.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM-chief organiser Philipp Lahm is to work with the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to consult the Bureau on this role and then, of course, be warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues", said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation about whether Lahm could be his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair surrounding the photographs of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that in future a national player without a migrant background should become the embassy of the DFB.
Currently, this office of native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If, without a migrant background, there is a clear impact on society and football and says that 'the issue is important, we have to take care of it', which would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration must work ', said Grindel.

Erdoğan opens Mosque in Cologne
On Saturday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite Gülen ’ s followers living in Germany and take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.

Several thousand police officers were in use, including snipers.
The Ditib Islamic Association is criticized for being an extended arm of the Turkish Government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Schrecksekunde.
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have won a joint concert in New York ’ s Central Park for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease.
"Don't hesitate, wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival in the night to Sunday before about 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with Fransen and golden microphone.
I am nervous, I sweat, but it is okay, because I am here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations, and aid organizations, were also on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a shrine customer when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal separator was a shock, feared and tried to flee.
Shortly, panic arose, people ran confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin calmed people out of the stage.
"Nobody tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You are all in safety.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available as every year free on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to snatch had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - Buhrufe against the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake, in the US Senate ’ s Justice Committee, declared himself in favour of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, thereby upsetting many women.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse and attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which rejects them.
Flake called for a FBI investigation into the allegations, after two women who, according to her own figures, have experienced sexual assaults on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet me in a lift at any time", said Flake at the concert in New York for the.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends the journalist's robbery.
Leader Steffen Seibert defended the Rauswurf of a journalist from Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s press conference (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had moved a T-shirt with the Turkish and German label "Freedom for journalists" and went into the first series.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a matter of disrupting the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has caused a great deal of unrest, which is unacceptable.
That is why he has caused people's defenders to take the man out.
Seibert said that it is not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This is entirely independent of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership of banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed attempted coup on July 15, 2016.
Some of the journalists accused face several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists, too, are not safe from the Turkish authorities: only in early September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
They arrived freely and could return to Germany, but trials are still underway in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller.
As fresh and generous, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: yes, it really is Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is known for humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour kneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller, with her guests, meets some beer, some wine or even more sophisticated drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also have the courage to speak for the obligatory singing.,,,,,,,,,,.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
The trip to the high north of Munich was not good at all.,,,, the., it,, the part is.
On Saturday he posted a Selfie - his face is completely disguised, the eyes only two small slits.
The Bett-Selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful cater.
He directed some of his fans - probably not entirely serious - insights that he has now won: "Rule one: goes NIE to Inas night.
Usually two: never drops the black sauce.
And syringe.
And the round Eierlikör, which melts Ina by half three, also leaves.
Alcohol consumption is truly a fact of life for the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the aftermath.
They were the most effective headache pills.
Other amuses simply looked over the sight of the normally attractive cinema bar.
So far, as Ina Müller has survived the nightly sausages, it has not been known.
Since they have moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa faces vandalism and treason.
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Scherben, Zigarettenkippen, Müll und Unrat, demolierte Mülleimer und mittlerweile demontierte Hinweisschilder - so präsentiert sich seit Längerem der Einstieg mit Sitzgruppe zum Radweg auf dem Haaße-Hügel in Treysa.
For the foreground project Bahnradweg in Rotkäppchenland a more than impersonal sight.
The topic is occupied by members of the ADFC district group Schwalmstadt, but others have been working for a long time, according to the Radverkehrsbeauftragte of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
There has been no solution.
The proposals range from the transfer of the group of seats to the regular discharge of waste containers and the cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities", says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the local council.
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrations at weekends.
Not only is this often the case, but also the gels are destroyed: posts are ripped out of the earth, dustbin demolished, shields are crossed, seat furniture is crushed.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, told ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
You are annoyed that the Rastplatz on the cycle path is a meeting place for sauna storage.
"Along the entire cycle path there is a clear focus on the Haaße hill," the Radverkehrsbeauftragte confirms, who now also cares about the new Radstätte in Ziegenhain, which is now open.
"It makes the same fate easier, it becomes quite expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps the threshold is significantly higher to attack the common good.
That would require, however, that a police strike be carried out promptly.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
It must be made more attractive.
After all, the frequency of the cycle path is very satisfactory.
The touristic marketing is still possible.
Our cycling path is very high quality compared to others in Germany, according to the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa to be extremely critical.
There is no abbey trail on the Haaße hill.
In the case of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of the road, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake.
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and co-existence.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Stadtteiloffensive Hiltrup, in the "Musikcontest für große und kleine, junge und erfahrene Musiker".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family relationship with coffee and cake from the official of the Cultural Station.
Seven formations took place, from the Ein-Mann-Band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albachtener band living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, declared District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not yet seen this in other parts of the city.
What did the textures relate to?
In the villages, the Hiltruper lake and the market alley were mentioned very often.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his powerful song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Alvin Jasic has always been involved in the experience of coexistence in these places.
Karl Franke animated the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
The Tontechnician Stefan Schemmelmann knew Franke that the recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest.
And Alvin Jasic placed all hand on Youtube.
"It is not about profits," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was something special for the favorites of the jury - so that others can hear their songs.
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann.
Another musician can record a song: Ihmig with his help drummer, who impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children went on to the final again - and even sounded 'right' without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, intimacy of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The city ’ s participation offensive was the occasion of its ten-year existence.
They valued the event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game.
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords that can only be deciphered - the old trick with the red slide - if you have inserted them.
This ensures that the other side can read nothing by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1 Renaissance.
2. Window.
3.
4. Fest '.
These are the terms that need to be encrypted continuously.
It is not the terms that should be guessed, but the codes.
A player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card which may be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" it is not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cubes", "feast" and "windows" - in such a way that his own team will recognize the correct order and the opposing team as not possible; because that wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
In other words, the encryption notifies and reads loudly: "Werfen" for the cube, "Lose" as opposed to feast; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he was in school and knows the window engraving there.
This is the way round for round, team for team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can get a better understanding of them with any reference that the encoder gives there.
It may be mysterious, but not turned off, so the enrolments should be, otherwise it is unnecessarily difficult to make his team.
The most cryptic to "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players must probably study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the net makes it easier.
But once you get rid of it, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as conclusive as predecessors and Genre Primus "codenames", which is also an agent science to play less words, but much better to play in small groups.
And who is only about rats and not winning points, who can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Mann shows police Hitler's castle and harassed guests in the pub.
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspectorate twice on Sunday night.
It was only in the Upper City that he showed the Hitlergruß in a police battle passing by, and later in the Upper City he also fell in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholised by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must also be criminally responsible for the use of labels of unconstitutional organisations.
Pressig factory was home to Schublok's factory.
The railway company in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
1991 ended a piece of railway history.
"When buffers were knocking on buffers, they heard it in Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archived the history of the place and the station.
That did not inspire anyone.
As quietetes also hit the brakes and squattered the wagons.
That was pure rail.
Statements that make sense for Dinkels ’ home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-Bergstrecke to the north, which after an increase of about 220 meters has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and Schubloks were needed, who had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station with 21 locomotives, apprenticeship workshop, steering and railway factory.
"At the heart was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a rebuilding in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historians and 47 years of professional railway companies.
Pressig (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the side routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported about a staff stock of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elliocs were stationed in Pressig.
Electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for train and Schubloks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 walls were still in place.
In 1982, parts of the plant were broken down in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we did not envisage better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport".
At Pfingsten 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Director celebrated a pompous Bahnhofsfest in Pressig on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the electrification of Nuremberg - Saalfeld.
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
Little later, the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig Rangier Station was history.
"The ranking and inhibitor learned the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any failure would have had fatal consequences.
Why the railway station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current images are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber ’ s Start Success with China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledonsiegerin Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.

A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened at the weekend during the series "Art and enjoyment".
With great relief registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Around Walberla" in the framework of the series "Art and enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was shown by a large audience.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name as the main organiser and artist alike.
Not surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have played an active role in the selection of artists in the past and have helped to create flyers.
This year again, a 70-cent special stamp, designed by them, is available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted at the high level of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler was able to be won for the musical Umrahmung from Nuremberg.
During the walk through the spacious garden, the visitor can quickly see that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playfully.
They are made of metal or ceramic, often with coloured accents.
Already at the entrance of the estate the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightly coloured, playful with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes.
With the sun shining through the bush in the background, the object looks fairy tale and invites you to linger.
From Eckental Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate himself to the event in three-dimensional letters, comes to K & G for 15 years.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
On half way Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" to help the smugglers through the multi-faceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 albums: Singers celebrate 50th birthday festive.
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
At that time, the Albachtener also made air of their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They did not want partout to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 albums from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It will be full today," commented Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachtener singers.
On the occasion of the jubilee, they had the foundation festival relaunched.
For years it was tradition, then there was only a break.
The traditional festival was back on time for 50 years.

On her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband.
Heide Keller became a star on the "Traumschiff".
Now she talks openly that the series could have had a joint guilt with Hans von Borsody on her marriage.
Heide Keller (76) made her famous role as chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traumschiff", but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series that made it the star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
For I was awakened with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues took me true on eye level, "says Keller in conversation with the" picture on Sunday ".
First of all, she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
For now, journalists were calling only at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well".
She thinks it is possible that her former husband could have been envious, but "like many men Hans also shy about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good English: I have adjusted myself ', as she says.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared frenzy and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever ".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time."
On the day before the official ceremony I sat in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never dressed with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller presented the love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I have gone to love too naively ".
The night fold, which regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has dared to join the ZFF opening party this time.
Our wrinkle is not a moth, but a bit shy.
And the sheer glamour in which a green carpet is baptized on the six-fenced square blends it over fee.
But it's a film festival, there's more or less famous in the spotlight sunshine.
So he torches on this late Thursday evening over the place to make himself easy in the "Aquaclean-WC oasis".
The public toiletries sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the demand in the Parterre of a new pavilion takes a great deal of effort to evaporate a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, the Herren-Oasis plunges into heaven for some reason.
So out here, on the other side of the street, the guests who have just entertained Green Book in the cinema next door at the opening film are celebrating the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as you know, the works shown are from all over the world.
What do you not have to get into an article about this festival to avoid falling into veil advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The wrinkle binds itself a bench around the feet, which has a good fat attached to it, and two bulky door stewards actually wink it generously.
Drinking, dancing far after midnight to live music or playing DJ rhythms to which they join each other, and filling up with Cüpli exquisite chicks.
In the delicatessen shop in the souterrain, oysters are waiting for sleepy coins, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain jumps.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
We must love that country!
The wrinkle studies the shield at the escalator: "wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
Should the two separate instructions be, he has swapped himself in the Dresscode.
But it is more a conditional construction, and that has certainly saved lives.
A cocktail called "Golden Eye", prepared with espresso, fits into the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not compelling.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting this brand for years, is not here in the evening either.
However, there is a face passing between local romance, cashier and kitchen articles, which is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
His main character should not be far away.
And really: straight Viggo walks Mortensen, with soon sixty almost like a choir boy acting through the crowd.
It is not being quatted, it is not being procured, and at most it is being hijacked.
It is precisely for this restraint that international stars love this film festival, which is.,, it is., it is,.

Four minutes before the Sirene, the lead was still apparently reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Griff the impartial into action.
Bieletzki is usually wary of seeking guilt among others.
But: The 120-Sekunden-Zeitstrafe, which Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke".
LIT had laughed well and met four times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys have fought great, stood up against seven men in the back and threw them into the empty gate.
Only can they buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damned victory has to come," says the restless Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Polls: 46% do not want Merkel to become Chancellor by 2021.
After the last few weeks, the GroKo is collecting several surveys.
The SPD is falling behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has for the first time overtaken the SPD in the Emnid-Sonntagstrend for the picture on Sunday nationwide.
In the weekly poll of the Opinion Research Institute, the AfD places a counter at 17%, the SPD scores a point compared to the previous week, and ends at 16%.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only come to 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union on Sunday.
The Greens reach 15%, the left 11, and the FDP 10%.
If federal elections were held on Sunday, the governing SPD, CDU, and CSU, together with Emnid, would receive only 43% of the vote.
The large coalition has now lost the majority on Sunday, with the exception of Allensbach, in all major research institutes.
The governing parties consistently reach 43 to 45% of the votes (Allensbach: 51%).
In the 2017 federal election, they received a combined 53.4 share.
The bandwidth is also large among the other parties: the AfD, in several surveys, is the second strongest party, reaching 15-18%.
The Greens achieve voting shares of 12.5 to 17%.
The left is at an average of 10%, FDP at 9%.
For statistical reasons, according to the percentage of votes, such surveys have a 2 to 3% uncertainty upwards and downwards.
But the popular support for German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen sharply since the federal election in 2017.
At the moment, only 48% of citizens believe that Merkel is the right person in the chancellor ’ s office, as the Emnid poll did on behalf of the BamS.
Only one second (50%), according to the poll, wants the grand coalition to hold until the next regular federal election in three years, with 41% for a new election.
In a further poll published on Saturday, too, it was clear that Merkel ’ s popularity was diminishing.
The Germans also judge whether Merkel should stand again for the CDU presidency in December.
47%, according to Emnid, are 44% against.
In the case of the Union ’ s supporters, 64% do not want a candidate, 35% do not want.
Aushang at Aldi: Price reduced to love luck.
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that there are no more romantic connoisseurs' stories in times of Tinder - he should talk about Putenfleisch at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates as a meeting place for the great love almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced pute meat, boxershort barrels at the chill table or the favorite pudding is still in doubt a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The App Tinder is a reputation for being a smart stock exchange rather than a contact one.
We have dared the test: How do women react, not long after they have been beating about the bush?
This is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood-Lovestory-Potential has it when the love affair precedes an Aus-den-ey-lost und-relapsed plot.
If the type is also reported under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch @ gmx.de at his Angebeteten, that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the creator of this Annonce in an aldi factory, which we do not know, that she will find her mammoth, with which she has briefly talked about the 30% reduced bio-pute meat.
For her belief in the magic of the analogue connoisseurs, she certainly deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood.

Football: Reus and Zorc call for peace for idols.
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate on the shape and fitness of Mario Götze.

That is not good for the boy.

Football: District League: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrhein makes courage.
There were moments in this young season, as Alois Fetsch went to court hard with the ropes.
Wortkarg resigned, the coach of the football league VfL Wolbeck, and withdrew only once (innerly) to make sense of the lack of power on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it runs again around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrhein, in the past game time only skimmed at the ascent.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the appearance.
"We have tightened the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen ", Fetsch praised his guys and sought every individual after the match to simply say" thank you "for so much counter-defense against the ambitious guests.
The Coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly over into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited in front of the balls.
Wolbeck had much more games in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs missed the lead before his departure (17), the changed Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38).
Almost that would have been the case when the SCA, in minute 41, shot down two times in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL mistakenly took full control.
Thewes failed from 18 meters.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entry.
With the influence of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed the left again a hairdresser.
When Altenrhein Chris Naberbäumer was in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect release for the platzherren 18 meters before the guest housing.
The Gefoulte himself stepped up and demonstrated his vulnerability to standards.
Westhues "Ding with the right snake struck at the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1: 0 (71).
20 minutes, which should be damned long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty room in the 80th minute.
Schiedsrichter Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Bange Minuten musste Wolbeck im Schlussphase überstehen, ehe Geske in der 87. Minute aus 12 Metern doch noch den Siegtreffer auf dem Puschen hatte.
Had perhaps been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes.

The Allbright-Foundation ’ s report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards.
In this way, only 8% of the boards on the day of 1 September were female, as indicated in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright-Foundation and which was previously presented by the German Press Agency.
"Companies will have to set up differently, otherwise international competitors will pass by", says Stiftungs-Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom, or Sweden, purely male management teams - with a few exceptions - are far from conceivable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented compared.
It is another business culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchanges is also due solely to positive impulses among the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright-data, only 6.8% of the boards are female.,,,,,,,,,,,.,
In the previous year, however, the figure was 3.8%.
The 30 Dax companies - in recent years pioneers - have stagnated the proportion of women.
Finally, 26 women worked at the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will again recruit consistent women next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of zero percent so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Every year, as many women were recruited for the boards, a 40% share would be achieved in 2023," says the report.
Some even make miese: luxury cups: Which manufacturer deserves the most per car?
Ferrari deserves best.
The Italians use every Ferrari 280,000 euros and make 69,000 euros of profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Those who make the most of the profits per car among the Edel-suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This is a question which has been dealt with by 'Autopapst' and Professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made 69,000 euros of profit in every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, by contrast, only around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley are putting their weight on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well off in the race with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros before interest and taxes.

On Saturday afternoon the 46-year-old rider of the emergency physician had crossed a red light with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then met on a crossing with the taxi that drove with green.
After the collision, the doctor ’ s day dragged against an ampelmast and a tree.
He wrote the Passantin, who died of the accident.
Drivers of the emergency physician and taxi driver seriously injured.
The 62 year old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency medical vehicle were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from the force.
The 29 year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another precipitated emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three serious injuries were brought to hospitals.
The police are investigating who is to blame for the accident, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor.
Manchester United is losing again, for Mourinho we are tireless.
Manchester United is now losing out in the seventh round of the Premier League after the palatable turnout in Ligacup.
There are no translations available.Gegen West Ham United unterliegt ManU 1: 3. Die Art und Weise der Niederlage dürfte noch zu reden.
Sinnbildlich war die Szene in der 74. Minute, in der der wiedergenesene Marko Arnautovic für West Ham das 3: 1 schoss; nur drei Minuten nachdem Marcus Rashford die Red Devils vermeintlich zurück ins Spiel geführt hatte.
As they suspected an offside on Mark Nobel ’ s pass, all Manchester defenders remained standing, leaving Arnautovic all over the world to shoot the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative climax of a performance that was previously far from adequate.
The mood at Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City is very different.
The Citizens trained by Mourinhos ’ great competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an approximate 2: 0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team broke the defensive barrier for the first time.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the previous goal, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also jumped to the top of the table.
Liverpool No longer Table Leaders
Three days after the 1: 2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League 1: 1 against Chelsea.
Like the Cup-Out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The meeting of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the final stage of the only match of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
So Chelsea was not the second time after the Reds had started with an impeccable record in the week.
First, the London team eliminated Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, and the Remis in the league toppled the Blues Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2: 0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, who played Granit Xhaka, had to wait for the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end buxed Watford defender Craig Cathcart a listing of Alex Iwobi unhappy into his own gate, only two minutes later Mesut Özil with his third season meeting for the decision.
Arsenal passed Watford thanks to the fifth consecutive victory and is just behind the great rival Tottenham in fifth place. A strong impression Wolcontinues under his Portuguese coach EspEspiriSant.
The Wolves stayed at 2: 0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in succession and occupy the 8th place.
VW ’ s core brand is missing: Parisian automobile salon in the light of the diesel debate.
The Paris Automobile Salon takes place every two years in exchange with IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not a topic, but omnipresent: The Diesel scandal and the fight for driving bans and retrofit should not let the German car companies get rid of them at the Paris industry meeting.
In 2018, they will be presenting their new products together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital from next week.,,,,,,,,,,, the,,,,,,
Diesel does not really play a major role in this.
The possible exchange- and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated by then with the government in Berlin, should nevertheless be an important subject, at least behind the shining scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models among others: The e-tron of the Ingolstadt is due to enter the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But both were officially presented.
The iNext of BMW is only to start in 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3er.
This year, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in their own halls.
The exhibition, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years in exchange with IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors came.
During the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had strength 5.9, the second was 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, enormous material damage has been caused.
After the earthquake, the tsunami erupted over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach for a celebration.
It is feared that the number of victims will rise significantly.
The figures have only come from Palu.
However, many other municipalities are also affected - along Sulawesis west coast.
Around 150 bikers celebrate worship service in Werdohl.
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final god service for motorcyclists in the peace church in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdohl - The place before the peace church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the programme.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and therefore responsible for the southernmost concerns of the PS-strong two-cyclists.
From April to September the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the house Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
The Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in Eveking ’ s Church of Peace.
There around 150 bikers met on Sunday to commit anything but ordinary worship.
From 10 a.m., the Boliden were ready before the church entrance portal.
At first, the biker lobster was on the program and it was possible to grow with coffee and cake or even with a defiant curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo-Team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
During the Biker service, the priest, Dirk Grzegorek, held the preaching.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided for the musical undertone.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill prefers poetical-quiet tones", says parish Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle services yesterday.
Follow-orfer Heimatverein celebrates big festival: After the apple comes the milk comes milk.
Borisch was also active during the actual day of action.
She served her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and showed his astonishing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle force, a finely crushed mass has been removed from the apples.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how this should become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step at this late Friday afternoon.
In forms packed and wrapped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces that look a bit like a hardness box for layer on top of each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step in the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice went on and down into a large vessel.
But the farmer had already completed his specialties.
He opened his treasure chest and presented the latest feather white to older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly large.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents came into contact, while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press, but also discover the built up refuge for themselves.
Also active members of the former soldier ’ s adolescent comrade committed themselves in the festivities and invited to short matches at some stations.
The Heimatverein will also offer an action day next year.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home will not be in the heart of the thrill of the scene.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
That is also obvious because of the subject: after all, milk will then be around.
1: 4 versus Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season bankruptcy: "Beschissene Situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat successively coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointing professionals from Hannover 96 to meet and spoke to them courage.
There were a lot of positive things before 1: 4 (0: 2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt, however,.
"It's a lazy situation, but you have to go out as a team," said 96-soccer professional Pirmin Schwegler and shouted: "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot off".
The more victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met, is at the bottom of two meters and is a descent candidate in its current constitution.
On the other hand, Frankfurt celebrated the first season home victory by the superior Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) reached the goals for the DFB Cup winner after the successful rehearsal for the European League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia ’ s Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hessen and never got to grips with Hanover ’ s defenses.
The long troubled storms following the World Cup showed with its speed and assertiveness why it is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilians borrowed from the FC Liverpool stood Allan for the first time in the initial formation of Frankfurt, which began to swear.
For the first time, a headball of Lucas Torró (17) on the network of counterfeit scooters was in danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense against Brazil ’ s Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (Rücken) in the short term.
The leadership for the budget leaders was almost inevitable and entirely deserved.
Filip Kostic hob raised the ball after a defensive corner in the penalty room, Haller prolonged by head to the gate where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga meeting for the defensive players won by the French branch league AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt continued before the break.
This time, Haller went to his Sturmpartner Rebic, who was skillfully danced and left 96-Torwart Michael Esser with no chance.
In the half-time, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak idea of his elf and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxons now played a little bolder forward, but ignited ideas remained in place until the end, when the connection buffer was still successful.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then put right on De Guzmán, who had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only a show run for the Frankfurt guests, even Jovic met one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile.
The room was very clean and comfortable.

Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Heilig-Kreuz-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross feast on September 14 or on Sunday afterwards.
The festival service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the closing ceremony.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shielded Christ, who comes from the Thirty Years ’ War and shot on which the legend is shot after a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed out of the rubble.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shrine of Christ, which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still unfinished, only the old building is standing, the lack of a long house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, parish Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The divine service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the divine service the procession took place to the Holy Cross Church and with the final blessing ended the church part of the Crucifixion.
For many years, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting the Catholic parish home to the secular part of the festival.
The members of the choir provided the visitors with hearty food and a wide range of cakes and weather adapted, farm eggs.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish of the parish about the damage to façade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming building work that will be dragging on until next year.
After the rumour has been around for some time, the damage could be identified more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already done a few years ago has increased, but more has also been found, which has only been made possible by the use of scaffolding.
The Sockelverputzarbeiten have been completed, before the winter it is planned to start work on the natural stone and it is hoped to complete almost half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße.
The Donau-Iller Life Aid opens a new home for disabled people in the Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße a very special house is now being handed over to his determination - all of those present were in agreement on the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in Donau-Iller ’ s home for some time now need the special architecture of the new building.
Wide corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and accessibility access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officer building was put to the test for the residents with Handycap: "The house had come into the years and no longer in the equipment," Bader explained retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators moved to the house.
The new building should be made as friendly and light as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new home for the.
Around EUR 4.6 million invested life aid in new construction.
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben EUR 450000.
According to architect Bader, the construction works have remained within the planned framework, both in terms of time and in terms of financial.
He was also thanked by the managing director of life aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The splitting between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
However, the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many presets that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile".
At the same time the housing and functionality had been well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And again: "The plot in this situation is a real happiness because it is no longer available in today's situation".
Overall, the new residential home in the Münsterblickstraße offers space for almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities divided into three residential groups.
We are proud to be Managing Director Heinz at the eleven full-time workers, all of whom are employed at a tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the Deputy SPD Federal President Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to be deprived of East Germany.
There are differences that hurt unity after almost 30 years.
With these differences, we cannot be satisfied, "the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern said," Day mirrors on Sunday ".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germany, on average, worked longer than the people of West Germany, but received 15% less salary.
"I can't explain this almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this shameful dog stop the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan-Jagdhund is meant to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their destination on Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom, together with three kilograms of dog feed, in order to 'facilitate animal reconciliation'.
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North ’ s friendships were announced this year at the third summit between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join forces in international sporting competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and jointly apply for the 2032 Olympic Games to be held.
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile engines in the course of mutual rapprochement.
Austria ’ s Moveable History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemoration year for almost ten months, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in retrospect to the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive, will present a very different presentation in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New Week, New Opportunity for the Government
Back to substantive work - that is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition that is beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU recently did not mention the "return to the work of substance" mantraartig.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working-class citizens in that country to the legitimate question of what the difference is between work and work, but be it.
If the federal government is now ready to devote itself to its task - governance - it should not now be stopped by debating terms.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks may already show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties come together to form the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the quarrel.
First of all, however, there are conflict-prone issues on the agenda with diesel equipment and the specialist immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get off the ground with exchange-rate premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in a duty to retrofit older diesel.
While a rapprochement has been recorded in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned specialist immigration law.
The SPD is calling for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers working or training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the 'change of track' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be quarrels among coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equals and equals have joined forces with GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without controversy, a society characterized by so diverse, sometimes contradictory, interests will not move forward.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be re-examined for partisan reasons about being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD should argue, but always have a view of the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
This is a key issue that can be addressed pragmatically - and thus regain confidence - both the diesel issue and the Spurwechsel issue.
That is why the parties must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger.
Minister in Visier
Does the Minister of Labour violate the law in force?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" their legalists had worked on social security reform, reported an oversized social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) comes as a surprise - it now brings the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumes that "the Minister only expresses her enthusiasm for the use of her team and in no way wanted to declare violations of the law of service in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, they now have questions to be able to free Har ­ tinger from any suspicion '.
Police are riding a street in search of women's careers.
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
There is now confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was anticipated that the investigators had previously set up an archaeologist.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, was able to limit the relevant place to a few meters in the multi-time use.
In addition, a ground anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said road piece.
For more than a year now prosecutors and criminal prosecutors have been working on the missing case.
A cycle path has been locked at Marxgrün and investigated with sonars, because investigators suspect that Heike ’ s body could have been stunned in the course of the rebuilding of the state road 30 years ago.
Colouring powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia ’ s anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial referendum on independence in Catalonia.
But there are already riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation in the autumn of 2017.,, is.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police have taken place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked, among other things, by advocates of independence, with colour powders, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3 000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honour their colleagues with a rally that last year was in operation in the polling stations as an illegal referendum.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence was also at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and the central security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the around 6000 separatists would then have tried to break through the police chain by force, and, among other things, the officials were using colour bags and eggs.
Six people have been arrested, 24 others have been slightly injured, and the authorities have been called upon to do so.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the referendum on independence.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the affluent region of Spain, the central government in Madrid in Catalonia in the autumn of 2017 had been forced to manage.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians were also abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the arrival of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration ended.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the 'right to self-determination' of Catalans.
Fußball: Oberliga Westfalen: Versammelte Ratlosigkeit: FC Gütersloh und RW Ahlen trennen sich torlos.
Red and white Ahlen continues on the spot.
In the FC Gütersloh, too, there was only one 0: 0 decision.
The closing lights and the third last puppets turned them off before 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as a gathered helplessness.
The first half was manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who would prefer to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so carefree.
There was no risk of missing a chance because there was virtually no one.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) torch of the entire lot recorded freight sloh Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only real - possibility was given by the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling, after 32 minutes with a shot from the penal border, forced a parade.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged for injuries, for whom Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
At the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel, who was 18 metres short of the housing and after an hour, was also active for the first time.
After a conquest of Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
The swiftly presented Konter over Sinan Aygün crowned "Nick Flock (62.) with a slight shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a head ball from Wieckowicz (66th), they moved to a corner ball from Ex-Ahleners Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interimstrainer Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
Nothing was done.
More than optical superiority, thanks to its own initiative, the Ahlener did not come about.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but also that did not bring anything.
Angelo Daut endeavoured to highlight the positive: "I like having played to zero", but unfortunately the zero was also on the front.
"This time we were not as tordangerously as we were against woodworking and although our opponent had no desire to play here", RW Ahlens Interimstrainer noted.
Offensively "pushed everything so a bit" against a team that only wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not feel that we could get a counter-tor, "Daut says.
But, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team were shooting a gateway.
The idea was too weak for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately there is enough chalk.
This is what Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are looking for from the Reckenfelder Tafelausestelle, for which these donations are intended.,,, and,,,,,,,,,,.,, the are.,
The volunteers insure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was shining blue and the place was slightly empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
For: "Here it is so beautiful sociable, therefore we are here today", said a visitor.
The organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper prise Humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who should actually be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there is enough chalk.
And the "replacement" didn't let it take to entertain more and more people in between.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a late hour.
"Just great", Marcel Kreimer joked.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to present the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased about the many active players with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"Actually there should not be something like a cube at all", he thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivities held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town has a colorful look - this is what is going on.
Then the Maikranz was taken off by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klitem with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarters.
A lot of stalls have been worked for the good.
From sweetness to heart everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who lives in Reckenfeld only a year ago, was creative in his decoration rooms.
He had a lot more to offer for furniers, for beer lids with reckenfelder motives and.
A speciality was offered by three Reckenfelder Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschsch.
The latter has one more specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, naturally with honey from my own production.
The little elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cakes.
The conviviality is that the visitors were not allowed to linger for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program.
Schmierereien mit lokalpolitischer Botschaft: Keine gelungene Werbung für Skateanlage.
In Lengerich, unknown people hardly promoted the construction of a skatepark.
In several places there are corresponding lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been brought against the police for material damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are denounced on signs, among other things, at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Town.,,,,,,,,,,,
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that an appropriate font was discovered at the staircase of the Gempt-Bistro after the professional election fair on 19 September.
As the short message was apparently "only" left with an Edding, they could easily be removed.
"Only a few days later this was again there, this time sprayed up", says Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertisement must be replaced.
A special note is given in this case by the fact that several large companies are also called Lengerich.
If the skatepark is built, it is also to be made possible by sponsors.
Promises have already been made, as Jörg Hesselmann explains, without name, from the school, sport and culture.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the molded table.
Local politics and administration have been working on the subject of skatepark for years.
After the old LWL clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began.
After all, the majority of the Council was in favour of the fire-fighting parking lot.
However, this was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against building at this point.
At the end of June, a U-turn followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word, then, is the City Council.
He proceeds from a decision this year so that a positive vote could be taken in 2019.
Impaired air traffic control is getting worse.
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers will not see any signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm," said the chief of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the many delays and flight failures is the long-standing lack of staff in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Across Europe, the market for ready-trained pilots is empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, around a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the Federal Government, countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports come together on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional occupational compression and overtime hours, that will not go without us", the head of the GdF, who has many members in the federal air traffic control system.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the lottery malaise.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings in national air navigation systems have now been fully integrated into the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that do not leave the air even more closed to air safety.
At the moment, the EU ’ s targets would be coordinated by 2024, and further tightening would be feared.
The EU is under constant pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now harvest exactly what they have sown in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high delay costs for airlines will lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German Air Safety Authority (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
The annual addition of 120 pilotage tubes, announced so far, over the next five years, is precisely sufficient to offset age-related declines.
The necessary staffing structure is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes in favour of Group Renewal
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the wishes of Thyssenkrupp-Interimschef Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two resignations, the supervisory body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the workers.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos of policemen and Catalan advocates of independence.:.,,,,,,,,,,
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan defenders of independence in Barcelona have led to violent clashes with many injured.
According to the city council, on Saturday around 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered together, as well as some 6000 independency supporters.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests apart with a large one.
According to the forces of independence, however, they have repeatedly tried to break the safety barrier.
They would have attacked the officials with paint and sausages.
According to the figures, there were also various protests among the participants.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police said that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation for colleagues
The policemen, with their demonstration, wanted to pay tribute to those colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve far more than they do.
The demonstrators found it a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona, in particular.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
It is only to provoke and celebrate the fact that a year ago they were perverted.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the charge.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year only did their duty: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because that is a great European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues were "not come to provoke", the policeman assured.
Pans allowed access to British ministers ’ personal data
A security gap in a mobile phone app caused ministers and Conservative British Tory Party officials to temporarily access their personal data for everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the pans became known one day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises the best game in the world: Ronaldo's best game.
The Portuguese star player "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3: 1 (1: 1) victory of the record master against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the expensive bought star was also the decisive man in the important match against the persecutors without his own gate.
"Ronaldo had lots of fun and makes it good," said Allegri.
Although we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew up.
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early lag through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst persecutor for the time being.
The Torjäger, brought by Real Madrid, first raised the former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26th / 49th).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by headball, did the preparatory work for the meeting of the defender, Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who just had to push in front of the line.
"He gives many templates", the coach praised.
But, of course, Allegri also wants to see goals of the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the Rekord-Torschütze.
"We need to be better at serving him," the coach asked.
Bester Juve-Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than €100 million, Juventus ’ superpower seems to become even more oppressive.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in series A. At 21 points, the master of the past seven years has already six meters ahead of Naples.
The table second, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But no later than after the reference to Mario Rui (58), who had already been rejected, the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the place after a hard entry against Paulo Dybala with yellow red.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turiner Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel there.
The German national player got his way at Juve.
The professional won by the FC Liverpool was used for all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champion League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo was at the 2: 0 victory of the Turiner flown from the place and is closed for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
Rapper Kanye West made a special appearance at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water compound caused scratches and question marks among viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change in name on time to publish his new album.
So let's call it "Ye", the musician says.
"The character, formerly known as Kanye West," twittered in line with the late singer Prince when he put his artist name.
But the pseudonym is no news.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most used word in the Bible and there it means" du ", so the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Endlich!
procured!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage made his disappointment no secret.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was more hands-on, we have put him as good as never before ".
Grade two chances in 90 minutes, so you can only rarely make games positive.
Football league A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) photo: Heinz Schwackenberg.
Also the SG had only two possibilities in the first passage, the first but used Maik Krause from a pointed angle to the early lead (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preliminary work by Krause he was vacant.
The hosts had only one double option when Moritz Höne failed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all gave.
In addition, Niklas Eilmann could not use a trailer - Louis Kortenjann had rescued a trailer with his hand on the line and saw Red for that.
Only when Nils Berheide stoned the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had criticised ourselves hard beforehand, that was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus's.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0: 1 Krause (7), 0: 2 Berheide (81).
Red card: Kortenjann (75. / Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spektakelfußball in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3: 4.
"I don't know what I think about it," he said.
"We didn't get any access to them", he presumably used to refer to the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also to all the other Green White, who played with collective offensive.
However, he could laugh: "A dreadful victory", he said, softened and withdrew from dancing players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
It is worth noting that after a duel of two teams, one of which is Albachten to play the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for the class halt.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back to the 90 minutes behind him.
"This was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0: 2, as we oppose one of the league's top teams throughout the game time, this was really phenomenal".
This makes it all the more bitter that we now have to go home with empty hands.
Top Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12th season meeting in leadership (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2: 0 he placed on the left side mustervalid on Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew that, but that is not the way to get a player completely out of the.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This was already madness, what made", Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent neidlos.
Shortly before the change of the page, his own elf made the balance: McGill ’ s free movement from left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia Torhüter Hinkerohe through the long torque (45.).
After the change of direction, it was McGill who rebuilt (59).
Then it went on and on.
It was a tough, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Albersloh was no longer able to repeat the last Concordia meeting (80th).
We must now concentrate fully on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that is what we must win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1: 0 Zymner (24), 2: 0 Fröhning (39), 2: 1 McGill (45.), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 Nübel (64.), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (59.), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Gelb-Rot: Atalan (74th / Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg is fighting against Primus
There have been no winners in the Landesliga-Duell between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The table leader was actually in favour of three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and at the end ended the game 0: 0.
Media: Total Bureau resigned from Dynamo Dresden
The entire Praesidium of Football Zweitligist Dynamo Dresden has resigned according to media reports.
Several media corresponded in the evening to a joint letter from the College of Saxony.
A confirmation of the association was not available at first.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligisten.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
Good that he is out again.
There are few public guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France ’ s president, Emmanuel Macron, has signaled that he wants to collect the Tolerance Prize personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term was too short: as president, he was not in Tutzings ’ Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
As Academic Director Udo Hahn put it when he was proud, "All the German presidents and Chancellor were already with us".
At the end of October Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on 29 September the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France ’ s President, Emmanuel Macron, has also promised that he will personally accept the “Toleranz Prize ” awarded to him by the Academy, which in another category also receives TV moderator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The 80 meetings to mid-2019 are in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a conference title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route over the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbary without Limit "..,,,,,,,,,,,
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks every human idea '.
From structural racism in society to the scissors between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitization, the spectrum ranges.
Academic director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to seek solutions or at least partial solutions".
A meeting on the 200.
The birthday of Karl Marx in the near future is expected by a more visitor to the direction of capitalism, the other more a tendency "from left to centre".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church", said head of study Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Musikkabarett: Geschlechterverständigung mit Herz - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten.
"Both adults and men were suitable" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As cabaret dancers, the understanding of the sexes prevailed, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and what else could there be, but also with music.
The mini-guitar set her up and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wings.
One is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the end of the sentence, and another a true pianist: so congenially harmoniously accompanied by sweetener Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
This was also the case with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, as was the case with the Red Fades of the evening.
Teubner had put a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner but does not open the door.
A closed door without partner does not bring any benefits.
The piano soloist now demonstrates the same thing: What would have happened to Mozart's compositions if "Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp glides into improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" into the "song of death", and from Mozart's g-minor symphony into a playful dancehall.
There were great applause and bravo from the full room.
Flowers were handed over to Karlheinz Kleintje, Treasurer of the Association, the Chansonette.
But President Heidemarie Markenbeck did not have any additional thanks.
She had the idea of giving the Duo a go-ahead in addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident at the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police corrected the number of victims slightly downwards.
10 passengers rather than 15 were slightly injured.
Everyone has now been released from hospital.
The French bus driver remained in hospital for one night.
He will be released during the day, said a spokesman of the police.
It is still unclear whether the cause of the accident at Bruchsal was.
On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus was unobstructed in front of a Leitplanke.
Handball: Damen-Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps almost the white west against TV Wattenscheid.
The girls had problems with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who only marked ten matches.
"Actually I was well satisfied with the defense, only a player has made too many goals.
We did not get them under control, "says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But the angry increased over the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the end left his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a backlog, lay behind the break with 11: 12 and later with 15: 18 (45.).
It was only by the end that the broader bank of the hosts made a decisive difference.
In addition, Aydogdu put back Merle Klement on the left side, which then made "extremely clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Bushkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern at the top of the VC Allbau Essen.
The BSV Ostbevern volleyball players have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West thanks to a top performance in the top game.
In the second liga descent VC Allbau Essen won the blue whites with 3: 1.
"This was a giant step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
This is what we have now worked out, "says coach Dominik Münch, after almost impeccable performance of his team at the overthrown table leader.
The guests dominated the first passage almost at will.
Over 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 he went to the runner-up of the previous year with 25: 15.
Eating was accepted in the duel but did not come into play.
We have done it well.
Our opponent has run a high risk but has also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already had 12: 8 "Essen switched the acceptance to three-gain levels.
We were unable to keep the pressure on the attack.
Food has been swept away, and we have let ourselves be lulled in a bit ', Münch continued.
At 18: 17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had the nose ahead.
Although Ostbevern resisted at 19: 24, four sentences were still in place, but the fifth attempt was his goal.
"The game was now a class better", the tutor was at a higher level.
Maike Rüdingloh and last of all Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV applied the sheet in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "Here we have played consistently and quietly".
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13, the blue white passage brought four with 25: 22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had caught an excellent day.
BSV Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the major Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"In the German-Turkish relationship, the mosque opening in Cologne left behind a havoc that can only be summarized with difficulty," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance of a common, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing the affiliation of Muslims with Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has encouraged 'many reservations'.
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself.
After the long summer break, Folktreff-Zeit is finally back.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., Nottuln Heimatverein is already hosting its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the Chamber of Old Amtmannei.
Almost exactly on the day it is then a year ago that for the first time we had a follow-up.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln ", says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our Folktreff was so fast in Nottuln eta.
No matter if Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the Amtmannei fireplace room was always full.
"The program at the next Folktreff is as always a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and nautical songs, folk songs, Evergreens and old drummers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who regularly invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer pledged his accordion for the first Folktreff "Birthday".
He was a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from Steinfurt, which played music with platinum texts.
Now he is travelling with an Irish folk band.
As Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in the Night", the listeners will be delighted and sent home with an earsauce.

China approved the planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair take another step forward on the way to the world ’ s largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority approved the planned merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This makes it the biggest obstacle for the billionaire clash in the United States, as well as for South Korea.
Last but not least, there was an improvement in the chances of an insider's agreement, because Linde promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October so that the merger can succeed.
From pure fruit production to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle the 125-year existence of the Kreisverbands für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last foundation impulse for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach was set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
However, he was still different at the time: when "Kulmbach City and Land District Association" he was raised from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
Also the purpose of the fruit growing association differed from today's work - in fact it was just about fruit growing, about flowers and horticulture that nobody thought about.
"At that time, in the Enlightenment era, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained county nurse Günter Dippold in his festive presentation.
Fruit trees should be lined up by highways, and schools have created so-called industrial gardens.
Obstanbau is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, which comprises approximately 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role, as do communicating knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer Youth Group "Maulwürfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a garden construction association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said Günter Reif, Chairman of the circle, and also OB Henry Schramm, emphasizing how important experiences in nature are for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge matter for us children, I doubt that you can collect a lot of fun with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are supposed to stand, the district association", supplemented Landrat Söllner and emphasized the particular importance of the gardens for the villages.
The association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt about district managers and expert Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with an image presentation through the long history of the association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came from the garden, for the winter it was dosed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has endured, it was there before us and we have to follow it", the expert argued for fruit and nut trees.
For this reason, for the gardening associations, there is an incentive not to let our homeland remain beautiful and worth living.
It is also to be welcomed by the new citizens in our clubs that the President of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl, added.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe our children and grandchildren", Günter Reif concluded the successful festival, which was solemnly surrounded by the tower shops of the music association Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta Talks: Canada ’ s Secretary of State Moves UN Speech
Mexico ’ s government wants clarity about Nafta: they provide an ultimatum for an agreement for both trading partners.
Canada's Secretary of State is now giving absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
The Canadian Foreign Minister, Chrystia Freeland, has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York, owing to the time of the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico.
Instead of this Saturday, the Minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, their spokesman, Adam Austen, told.
Meanwhile, they focus on renegotiating Nafta.
The Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the US would have 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the US.
In August, the US and Mexico agreed to recast the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks on a new order have been going on for more than a year.
Until Sunday evening (local time), they are now to be brought to a close, Trump ’ s government wants to submit the deal to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico ’ s President-designate, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro after a report of the daily newspaper "O Globo", where he lives.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
At the beginning of September, during a campaign in southern Brazil, the politician was attacked on the streets.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations against Bolsonaros mobilized racist and fraud-despising statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In Brazil ’ s capital, protests were mixed with a rally by the Brazilian Workers ’ Party ’ s presidential candidate, Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore cannot stand for election.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As an ex-mayor of São Paulo ’ s Millionenstadt, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in surveys.
While the "Trump of Brazil" has long interfered in politics, it has recently become an anti-system leader.
If none of the candidates in the first round were to obtain the absolute majority, there will be a run-off on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from this - no matter whom he takes.
Bolsonaro is known to have been fighting homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again, it shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that Lula ’ s left-wing Workers ’ Party supporters should be shot dead.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died.
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children on the bed.
The musician has been in treatment since the beginning of the year for prostate cancer.
Larsen became known with the band Gasolin, which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the release of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the most sold album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister, Lars Lökke Rasmussen, honoured Larsen on Sunday in a statement as' street young 'who was' against everything but in all hearts'.
The head of government also recalled that the monarch opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 at the 70th anniversary of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.

The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" are the only ones that make this rocky live band live on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert start, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that the rock protagonists from Ahlen and surroundings - all in association with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands lautstark the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" -Rocknacht visibly excite.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with Frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to start the concert with the latest unknown pieces from his own pen and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced to the voice and impressing interaction.
Although "addition" calls are not to be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then left the stage to the Trio "Here We Stand".
Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock, demonstrating guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used for "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar.
Not only the longing, almost ball-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change of melodic passages to the gitarrenic rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
The band will be presenting their hardrock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with her performances to a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis on the tour in China in 2017 - has special stage experience is obvious and incomprehensible.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, together with the band, also sets his own accents in the single covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
The sound is even more sophisticated than before, with guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivering a cheerful solo while running through the audience.
A certain volume is genrebedingt bei ei ­ nem solchen Hardrock-Konzert selbstverständlich dazu: Bei der "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht liegt die laut Auskunft des Mischpult-Teams beim Dreier-Konzert von "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" und "The Ignition" bei etwa 98 Dezibel.
This is due, for example, to the pressure hammer level, but it is still well below the "Wacken-Fesitvals" controls, to which "The Ignition" refers on their website.
The Ahlener audience doesn ’ t need to eat this rocknacht, however, as 120 in, in, in, in,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher, rocky Gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuosic game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saws and bred a concert table with the power of a tiger", all three groups can say at the end, however, in the transferable sense.
And above all enjoy the great applause of visitors.

Trump blames Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that US President North Korea ’ s rulers are well disposed toward Kim despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
But Trump has now made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
This also has to do with kims "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become a new flame.
The tragedy: it is a remote relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Prior to West Virginia supporters, Trump found almost zärtliche Worte für den halb so alten Spross der Herrscherdynastie aus Pjöngjang, obwohl der sich im Ringen um Nordkoreas atomare Abrüstung als recht zäher Brocken erweist.
"I was scarce, he was also, and between us it went forth and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
Not only did the talks with Kim have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote beautiful letters to me, it was great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service behind it.
That the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - is not likely to be yours for everyone seemed to the US president.
In any case, he immediately accepted the expected criticism of his appearance in a large sports hall in Wheeling City: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That is so unpresidential.
But he cares little about that, told Trump, and then put his finger on the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential".
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there in this stubbornly filled arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.

Refugees Saved from Libya ’ s Prison Video
Nigeria ’ s refugees have, by means of a mobile video, pointed to their disastrous prison conditions in Libya, thereby enabling them to be rescued.
The group had shot and spread the picture online in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the site "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he took himself in danger of life according to his own.
One of his fellow fighters was beaten almost to death by the carers, Onyeka said.
Generally speaking, the conditions of detention have been catastrophic: 'They all beat us with pipes and sticks.'
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Approximately 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back home this year through the program, as the IOM spokesman in West Africa, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
He has not heard of a help uf by mobile video.
International organisations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as degrading to human dignity.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants from Africa to Europe.

Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has, in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called for the rule of law in Turkey according.
The two countries' relations are currently overshadowed, "said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns, above all, waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
According to his own data, Laschet also mentioned the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
As a result, Erdogan reiterated the independence of Turkey ’ s judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was moved to a building in the short term for the airworthiness of the Federal Defence Ministry at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Wahn Castle - but this was rejected by the party owners out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib-Mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: 'The Muslims who go into these mosques are also citizens of our country'.
And we are also their contacts - not the Turkish President.
Failure to trust the US: North Korea is demanding disarmament.
While US President Trump will not tire of emphasizing the success of the negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a deal from Washington.
North Korea ’ s Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula in the UN General Debate, with its continued sanctions.
"The recent stalemate is that the US is building on coercive measures that are lethal to confidence-building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, there is no way we disarm ourselves first," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
The fact that sanctions could force North Korea to "knee" is a dream of people who do not know us.
But to build trust, his country stopped nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, highlighted Ri.
On the US side, however, there have been no 'corresponding reactions', the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, last year alone, the UN Security Council adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, have been urging the United Nations to adhere strictly to the punitive measures in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working toward rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea ’ s leader, Kim Jong Un.
After the first Singapore summit, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is expected to return to Pyongyang to talk about ending North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community.
That they were actually in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with: white ceilings and flower muck on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the harvest dancing service.
The young people of HoT were enchanted by the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: a power failure had overturned the huge, two-part refrigerator, which was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start from scratch again: although we received a great deal of support from friends and neighbours, the children and young people wanted to do it alone", says Westbuer.
And so they all wrapped up.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Better can't cook it either," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," stressed pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen, with card tricks and other pieces of art, made astonishment.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board of Directors NRW of the Ta.
From frustration about criticism from one ’ s own ranks, the chief of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has left his post in the National Association.
Sartor was known nationwide because the Essen table had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He resigned as Vice President of the NRW Tafeln in July, Sartor said "World on Sunday".
Too many people have fallen behind me.
The head of the NRW Tafeln-Landesverbandes, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism was taken with Sartor.
"I can understand his step - people have said that they did not know exactly why the Eagle Table is doing this.
But Sartor is still active for the dining table - "six days a week, nothing changes", so Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized in the "World on Sunday" again criticism of colleagues from other tables.
We should not take the approach 'without starving the people of the city'.
It is up to the state to ensure that people did not starve.
On Friday in Berlin, the Essen Congress did not participate.
"It tells me too much sweet jewelry," he said.
These are all the social fuzzis that criticised me at the time.

In the German daily debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had seen a fury on June 30, 2017.

"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental proclamation of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexual couples.

Pleite at Hertha: picked up from reality: Bavaria against Ajax demanded.
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not want to let FC Bayern "fall.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate fazit for Niko Kovac ’ s term of office.
The first small performance models under the new Coach Niko Kovac are not intended to increase for the Munich population at any rate to the greater.
"A week ago we still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we got a bit of reality ", said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0: 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions-League-Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, who knows, knows that we are really annoyed and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no gate has been shot out of its own, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory, the spreadsheet in the Football League for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its run-intensive Mann-gegen-Mann-Taktik and the Berliner by their playful needle stiche over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last overpowering Bavarian are to be cracked.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we will do everything we can to get back to success," said Kovac.
But, with his losers in his birthplace, he was surprisingly gentler, and defeated his first defeat as Munich coach only on the again flawed handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless be a positive step ahead of the country break - otherwise the tone will probably get worse.
So Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second premier class performance of this season after the 2: 0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday begins as planned the short preparation for the second round against Ajax, which had also been sovereign to launch AEK Athens with 3: 0.
"Now we have caught up in two games, but we will also make our goals again", announced national team chapter Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost Cup finals against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly.
The legal defender appeared in the role of Mahner.
"I do not believe that this is all bad luck, we have to work out it again, because we do not make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes", stressed the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season the Bavarians even had five meters behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead with one point.
And so, with a wink, Kimmich valued at least positively that the public debate about supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now ended.
"Yes, that's already good," said the national player.
For the league it is already good.
DFB bosses in the firing line: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkey ’ s President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel may see mistakes, but defends the Verbandslinie.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the power of interpretation in the Permanent Strike Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the former World Champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib-Mosque in Cologne, the DFB ’ s chief defended the Verbandslinie.
On the early Sunday morning, the Grindel in Mainzer ZDF- "Sportstudio", attacked by Özil personally, announced consequences from Causa.
"In the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that this is not repeated", said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as a further integration representative.
At the same time, Grindel once again declared that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil and our Ilkay are born and in Germany.
They have excluded them from this society because they let themselves be photographed with me in England, "Erdogan said on Saturday in the Domstadt.
Frankly, as its president, I could not digest it that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, have been excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "sensibly treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair that had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would face players in the future.
That someone says: if I win, I am German when I lose, I am Migrant - that is not possible.
"That he has such an impression, I very much regret," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, as I have always said.
But he does not see a basis for Özil ’ s return to the national team.
In addition to the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration commissioner is to be appointed as a follow-up.
"If, without a migrant background, there is a clear impact on society and football and says:" The issue is important, we have to take care of it ", which would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for the post as DFB president next year.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes," said Grindel.
Years of age are building three accidents within three hours.
Coburg / Rödental - As the police reported, the 75 year-old caused accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 o'clock.
The 75-year-old driver was first mentioned by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
He told the pensioner that he would have gone against her car.
There was no personnel exchange, however, as the 75 year old was unable to find the lady in the car park.
A short time later, a telephone message was sent to the police about a car driver who would have departed from the road and travelled against a bus post.
The man did not want a police force on the ground and was then driven by it.
After that the Romans went home.
However, in his place of residence in which he has lived for decades, the pensioner has been collecting a construction vehicle.
After all, the police could find and stop him.
His car reported significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much more.
The damage is approximately EUR 1300.

At times, more than 1500 people tried to control the large-scale fire.
The air force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehrtestgelände near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with military drones.

In the German daily debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had seen a fury on June 30, 2017.
For example, he accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of being "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental proclamation of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexual couples.
Previously, they had been able to sign up to their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right to adopt.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and to relieve relatives in stress situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stress situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved if necessary by Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs must continue to be taken out, as in Germany, only with express consent.
It is estimated that 15% of Swiss donors have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only five per cent of cases will find a card at the decisive moment in possible donors.
In more than 60% of the talks, the family do not know the desire of the deceased.
"They must then decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations of storing information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the speaker at the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - per or other organ donation - does not exist," she says.
German Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be regarded as organ donors unless he or she contradicts them.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14 year old pupil is world champion in head count.
The 14 year-old pupil Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in the headcount.
At the weekend in Wolfsburg he fought 39 fellow fighters.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, announced on Sunday.
The 16 year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany ranked third.
The youngest member of the World Cup was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest of whom was a 74 years old French pensioner, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants were competing against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Greetings were already present two years ago when 14-year-olds were present in Bielefeld.
With terms such as Superhirn, Genie or Wunderkind organizer Laue can do little.
"Headcount can be trained", he said.
Many participants took a number of hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there is even computing competition in stadiums.
One of the disciplines, for example, is the square root drawing of six-figure figures.
In the case of versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have good chances, as the chief referee said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in favor, because early childhood headcount is learning more intensively and with other effective methods.
An urgent appeal: video with naked Serena Williams: it is about breast cancer screening.
Tennis Ass Serena Williams is shown by her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to draw attention to breast cancer and stand up for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and education.

The singer Chrissy Amphlett died from this.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project dealing with breast cancer detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
An emergency OP was launched to save the life of the baby.
A subsequent CT found blood clumps in Serenas Lunge.

Polare Kaltluft brings new snow to the west on the mountains.
Mrs Holle shakes her beds in the West for the first time next week: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snow limit decreases to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in close valleys it could cut down to about 1,000 meters in strong intensity.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern it is possible to expect between 20 and 40 centimetres of snow above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße), road conditions are therefore wintry.
Farmers are allowed to start with annual sticking on Monday.
Schleswig-Holstein ’ s farmers are allowed to start with the annual sticking service on Monday.
The "green ramparts", unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the Federal Forest for some 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree and rock walls are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreats.
Knicks, as a corridor, scattered habitats through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Society (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences.
The Knicks were founded by a command of the Danish king Christian VI. in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limiting and fencing, they also supplied firewood and beams to the farmers for their workshops.
From that time his name "Knick" also came from: by "reopening" the branches could develop the dense, interwoven boundaries.
Today, about 45 000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the picture of a large, varied and structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a replacement habitat by around 7000 species.
In one kilometre of Knick, up to 1800 different species could live and brew up to 30 bird pairs.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecological important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he becomes a light series of trees that, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the sticking service can only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesians talks about SItuation on site.
The local radica Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami in the interview with the German (RND) editorial network:
Have you been there during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport was closed on Palu at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be used.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have set up something provisionally where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many are eager to see the surrounding hills, where they still endure fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some people stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and the petrol stations are completely closed, people are looking for some food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down, and the national government is helping.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partly free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many corpses around, many people have not been found and are missing.
How does communication and information on the island run?
At the moment we have Handyempfang, but before that it did not work and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people, from whom they do not know whether they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but, for example, on work.
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they are known to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Firering, not prepared for earthquakes?
But, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuation.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, and the earthquake has hit many people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must waive Aogo and Donis for a long time.

Both players are definitely not an option against Hanover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss the game after the following country break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give up a forecast of the downtime.
A muscle bundle crack usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fibre crane usually heals a little faster.

San Sebastián - With the film festival of San Sebastián, the most prestigious European festivals take place every year.
Despite all the scenes on the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning the fire brigade Olching tried to capture an injured duck.
The action, however, took some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers on the Olchinger Lake noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
It was in the area of the water monitoring station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
The first attempts to capture the duck, however, went wrong.
Despite the injury, it has been able to evade the forces again and again.
At the end they fled to the lake.
With a rescue boat, the fire brigade could encircle the animal and push it back to the country, where it was then put into a transport box by a fireman after almost an hour with a brave handle.
The duck injured at the breast was then brought to the LMU's pet clinic to Oberschleißheim.
But, after the first assessments, their chances of survival are rather small.
Biathlet Julian Eberhard peilt World Cup Medal
Biathlet Julian Eberhard had four places at Olympia long in the stomach.
In the coming winter the Saalfeldener wants to catch up with the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in Pyeongchang ’ s Olympia sprint the medal.
Seven tens of telescopes were missing in bronze at the end.
"I have deliberately allowed myself time to process this", says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it simply did not want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missing precious metals in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution.
Sometime you have to complain.
The WM-Loipe in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "The track I've already closed into my heart", he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup race in the single race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter.
With the relay he ran in Oslo (NOR) to rank two.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in Turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With a FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the haughty majority for the judge candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been contested for allegations of nullity.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline of Friday to clarify the alleged incidents over 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama surrounding the occupation of Kavanaugh, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on on Friday.
Following an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer ’ s angry tirade opposed opposition democrats, the Senate ’ s Justice Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the Supreme US Supreme Court ’ s arch-conservative judge.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his initial announcement, that he would agree, but demand a FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described Thursday's serious conversations as a 'Commissioner', initially contained further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of 'happiness in the accident'.
In this way, last doubt could be resolved, he said.
Later, in an election rally, Trump rallied the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House also has extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One will specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, not more, said a government representative to the "Wall Street Journal": "They do not go on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.

There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: The fear has been felt.
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is large after the first season victory.
However, against Mainz, time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball inside.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room, "said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathe.
After all, the king ’ s blue was still able to bring the scarce 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first season victory under the roof.
In fact, this could have happened differently.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of chief coach Domenico Tedesco security had given Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing her", with increasing the head.
Really no headball-monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours", Heidel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand this".
The guys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore moved on.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no important part with his headball-match: "I am actually the worst headballer player in the team".
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including, of course, Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the early stages and make a firework out of it", said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a couple of hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to tackle lots over 90 minutes.
Perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Royal blue missed it to worry more about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the Latte 59th / 72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have become a quote victory", Tedesco said: "You have felt the fear a bit".
I am therefore pleased that we have won.
He was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoking column visible in the Leitzachtal 2 km.
The noise was not overlooked.
From around two kilometres of distance a hiker has observed a fire in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause found police and fire brigade soon out: A unknown had incited rubbish on a two square meter large area on the Gschwendner Berg.

And that is near the forest.
30 Fish bacon firefighters were engaged in the disintegration and extinc.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on equal terms.
Before them is the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has again followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my job to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - that association which cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in the evening.
El-Mafaalani rises very loosely in the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject intelligently.
With a lot of gestures, solid figures and one or two jokes, he brings one of the most conflicting themes closer to listeners: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are there increasing conflicts?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table, German society, at the cat table, sits the first generation migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
That leads to conflict.
It is not, therefore, crucial whether one is politically right or left-wing, but: 'Do I stand for or against an open society?', he stresses.
Initially rather behave, then the discussion round is always going on.
And there is a need for speech.
From his perspective, an Afghan refugee tells two teachers how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is standing, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not push his mind, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because 'only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions', says El-Mafaalani.
During the ensuing signing session, he was still open to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, during prepared Kurdish specialities, and discussed intensively.

In this way, Schalkes Naldo "big sport" also succeeds on the bank.
For the third time in a row, Naldo thanked Domenico Tedesco, a Schalke coach.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat for the third time in succession not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange-rate, understanding among many people would have been great if the almost two meters big Brazilian had rightly spoken the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered after the 1: 0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle and chief coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who call all the simplest half of Naldo, turned up and said; "We have to thank trainers!"
"This was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reserve existence, did not have any resentment.
Problích knows Naldo, who was celebrated as the best songwriter in the past season, that he has not, in fact, been sidelined by his coach - but has been given a break for good reasons.
One reason called "load control".
It was not easy to tell him that.
"It was not easy to tell him this, I tell you quite honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment when he told Naldo that he was not in the starting eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it is always about the thing, it is about the association ", founded Tedesco the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bavaria and Porto.
It is 36 years old.
It is important that at the moment everyone can sneak through.,,,,,,,,,.,,
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation, which last also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: also by acting as an exemplary team player on the bank.
In August, the mood in Austria ’ s industry continued to accelerate its decline relative to the eurozone.
The PMI Shopping Manager Index was 46.7 points on a 37-month low.
Despite this, Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike Austria, the euro zone ’ s PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1, yet the index is still below the 50 counter mark for the 13th month consecutive.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks (42.1 points) were in the dark.
In Germany, France, and Spain, the voting barometer sank, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index with 44.0 points reached the highest level since March.
"The slightly weakened downturn may mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone have fallen as much as they have since November 2011.
The companies therefore completed the seventh month in succession.
In China, too, industrial production fell stronger than initially thought in August.
The voting barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing management index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, increases are developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices.
