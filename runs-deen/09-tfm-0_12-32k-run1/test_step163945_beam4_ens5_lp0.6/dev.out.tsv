Munich 1856 : Four cards that change your view of the city .	-2.7282
A deceptive talt where young people are supposed to meet today .	-9.5770
A pit chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being excavated .	-3.9747
Smaller farmers cultivate the former land .	-5.5778
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .	-3.5229
It nerves if maps are not current .	-3.5160
Everyone who had to get worked up because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-5.2250
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas , an offer by the Geoportals of the State Government of Bavaria , are anything but up-to-date - but that is precisely why they are very revealing .	-6.7702
Especially if you compare them with current online maps .	-2.7648
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century in the crime area of the Mercury in Munich .	-5.0732
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be seen as such .	-3.8433
In the large overview map , more detailed maps were drawn up for cities and municipalities , so-called ballot papers .	-7.2392
These were created according to the Bayerischer Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and correspond to the first survey of Bayerns . were and .	-6.7351
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.3528
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-3.6564
Napoleon wanted to have an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria for military purposes , of course .	-5.2667
Even though the French troops finally withdrew from Lunéville with the peace of 9 February 1801 , today ’ s neighbors were the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map .	-6.2990
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project , founded the " Topographische Bureau " ( Topographical Bureau ) and thus the Bavarian surve.	-5.5827
The Munich Urpositionsblatt dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .	-4.5957
The comparison between the former and the present is the most impressive example of the state capital .	-5.0669
The city has spread in all directions and has grown together .	-3.1492
An example of this is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map .	-4.3535
Sendling was introduced 21 years after the creation of the map , 1877 , as a Munich district .	-5.4165
Today Untersendling is located in the heart of the city .	-3.0127
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the Plinganserstrasse , which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705 .	-4.9896
Where the western park is today , you see nothing as fields - at first glance : a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears when zooming in : handwriting numbered pieces from the so-called " Uraufnahme " , from which the land tax was derived .	-7.3285
Today , small plots no longer occupy farmers there , but rather small gardeners of the " Land in Sonne " plant .	-6.3280
A large green area is situated north of Untersendling .	-3.2045
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest , was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert .	-4.5830
On the other side of the Isar there is the historical map an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-6.9812
In the Urpositionsblatt , in the area of today 's Au-Haidhausen district , one reads not only the street name " at the Gasteig " or the heights " at the lies " but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-8.0805
Yes , here at the Auerfeldstraße people were once locked up with madness .	-4.9446
In 1858 / 59 the Munich County Irrenanstalt " Auf der Auer Lüften " was created . were , and .	-11.8188
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who was associated with the death of King Ludwig II .	-4.8575
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the purchase of the so-called delusions .	-4.7398
In addition , he has forbidden the staff to use force against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Haidhausen Museum , who has occupied himself with the institution for an exhibition .	-5.4864
For 280 patients , first place had been , later was extended to 500 places .	-5.6480
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular mist in Haar in 1905 .	-5.5875
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of the largest psychiatry in Germany , is located there .	-4.4446
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt , young people meet in the Munich-Salesianum .	-5.2344
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training enterprises .	-3.1539
Westlich lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost , east residential buildings from the 1980s .	-3.8318
In 2015 , the " Casa Don Bosco " children 's house was erected , modelled on the origins of the deception that had been destroyed in World War II in bombings .	-6.0653
The Marienplatz was named " Haupt Platz " in 1856 . The Kaufinger street was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.4258
A decisive change brought the Second World War to the heart of Munich .	-3.5825
The Allied bombs in December 1944 demolished many holes in the city centre .	-4.3662
A large one remained until today - at Marienhof .	-7.7000
The English Institute , small businesses , and a medieval chapel once stood at the Marienhof , where these days the preparatory work and on April 5 , 2017 the funeral for the second S-Bahn ( city rail ) line were .	-8.0192
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.0762
Civil rights group published travel warning for Missouri	-2.5175
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State .	-3.8990
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travelers , visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel by the State and to exercise extreme caution , as a series of questionable race-based incidents have occurred recently throughout the state and are noted here , " says the group 's opinion .	-7.5840
A recent law by Missouri , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination actions , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state aimed at disproportionate minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , NAACP said .	-5.8422
" You have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-3.1145
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the president of the Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.3065
" We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not heard yet . "	-2.3483
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-2.1602
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.3015
Sanders died in questionable circumstances early in the year , after he had no gasoline during the trip by the state and was detained by the police of Missouri , without being accused of a crime .	-4.8261
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri , which shows that black drivers in the state will hold 75 % more frequently than whites .	-5.2764
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.5426
" People must be prepared to bring bail or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-4.9426
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s Hassverbrechen report program , which classify the state in terms of the number of such violations to the country ’ s 16th rank .	-4.9142
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law , which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-8.8254
Before that , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for having migrated , which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling .	-5.3973
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently pressure groups have used the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the US .	-3.9756
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary .	-1.1127
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun-Projekt is a success project and will be continued next year .	-2.6834
The members of the CDU , Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac , obtained a picture on the spot .	-3.9757
On the occasion of the rights grabenhof of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverbands met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members . of , the of . , the of , , , the of . . .	-13.7435
Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his company , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , cooled 40 dairy cows and also supplied many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests .	-6.1228
" Black Forest milk " is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , says Schwendemann .	-4.5943
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional .	-4.5527
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach , he described the Weidezaunprojekt as " elementary important " .	-4.6994
I cannot make profitable economies on such steep land .	-4.0652
The green space for a lot of work , a lot of work has to be done with the Motorsense .	-5.1010
" We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography " , Schwendemann stressed .	-3.6458
In 2003 he took over the parental business and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not run a bio plant .	-5.3595
For mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The Commune recognized the importance of the Weidezaunprojekt and is glad about the promotion of Leader " .	-5.6761
Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of EUR 3 000 to 4 000 per hectare .	-3.5382
It is hoped that the afforestation of land could be extended for a long time to come .	-5.3212
" The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and worry about how to continue their business , " stressed the mayor .	-4.8347
Farmers are often criticised for promoting it .	-2.4291
In 2013 , a total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were fenced in for .	-4.9588
The open area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be raised until at least 2023 .	-6.2896
Of the total cost of € 71 500 , half was funded by Leader , a district that contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach .	-5.1577
Thus , farmers love EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of meadows .	-4.1462
" The big advantage is the longevity of fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-2.8570
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You do a good job without farmers and rural women does not work " .	-5.0006
Even for Peter Weiß , it was clear : " Here we produce the best food " .	-7.8848
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg facilitates the state promotion of fences .	-8.2279
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.3125
Prerequisite is the existence of a support framework defined by the LPR .	-6.5623
In addition , the area to be fenced must not be draconian ( 35 % gradient ) and must therefore be threatened with reforestation .	-5.9162
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 parcels , who want to build the 16 km fence , is currently under way .	-6.4359
The conservation area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-4.0893
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.2325
Now Trump ’ s White House is embracing the Statue of Liberty	-3.1458
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues .	-2.8720
Americans , like everyone else , therefore appreciate Saddam Hussein 's carefully staged overthrow in Baghdad 's Firdos Square in 2003 .	-5.3710
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically curtail legal immigration with a sense of freedom .	-4.9399
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-2.0113
A horde of boat owners and liberty-beekeepers would have borrowed him if he had done so .	-3.8787
But he grasped their meaning , and especially the meaning attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base .	-5.1291
As Miller Acosta , " I don 't want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the statue of liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-4.9037
The poem to which you refer was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . "	-3.1151
Miller is factually correct , but , as he put it himself , this is not really about history .	-3.6366
It is about the contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " Your mills , your poor , / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely , / the elk waste of your rich coasts . "	-6.3668
There was never a time when the " elating waste " on our screens was better to see .	-3.7890
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.8228
This conflict , because of the importance of statue , is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-4.6731
Lazarus - and her friends who advocated placing their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they were performing a highly political act .	-4.8422
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic visual representation .	-5.5911
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-3.0472
And she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the exiles .	-3.2016
The combination of poem and image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.9175
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this a long time ago .	-3.7964
The great cries of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone , but rather an early neo-conservatives who brought America ’ s flame into the post-World : “ Lady Liberty is moving forward . ”	-6.7585
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.4349
The torch should not pave the way to the United States . '	-2.3416
Ziemlich ungewöhnlich ist Limbaugh hier auf etwas gestoßen .	-2.0246
The importance of statue is quite a question of the position of perception .	-4.4862
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , elving but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-4.8507
It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.9504
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the will they must hear .	-3.6702
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-2.9917
Their torch should not enlighten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power .	-4.0869
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish team members of Britain	-3.4309
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the British team .	-2.5270
The performance director of the UK Light athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team in the World Cup cadre .	-9.7172
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.3493
Black believes that " something special is developing in Scotland " and the United Kingdom 's athletics have to learn from it .	-4.0851
" We welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , " said Black .	-2.9029
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.5110
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.0409
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-1.9667
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.7772
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . "	-1.6701
Several of the Scottish athletes are Medaillen-Anwärter , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team captain .	-4.3366
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.5918
Your captain 's speech was incredibly ' , says Black .	-3.1499
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-3.6181
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great . "	-5.3246
The Commonwealth silver medal winners , who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 m hurdles , say that it is " unbelievable " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.5495
Scotland ’ s best total athlete so far at the World Cup was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-4.4323
The midrange runner , Muir , is heading in this direction and last year set five British and two European records .	-5.7099
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .	-3.2282
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scotsman to watch the victory of the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games after a great season .	-9.6790
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot in Team Lee McConnell was .	-3.3962
The team chapter says that it is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of their compatriots belong not only to the team , but in some cases also to the medals and the finals .	-5.0625
" The special thing about being a team chapter is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-5.7954
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.4658
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.8914
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to podiums .	-3.5538
As regards my speech as a captain ?	-2.7359
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.3219
I just pointed out that we are very happy with this situation , as we have a home world championship .	-3.6382
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are once again in the Olympic .	-4.3380
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be so easy to be a great atmosphere out there . '	-7.7274
Blocking critics of Facebook : Don ’ t be bothered by a public office if you can ’ t stand in the way of electorates .	-11.3377
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-2.8298
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles .	-3.8943
He shifted criticism , certainly .	-4.3050
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.3197
Because in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be removed - and , stupid and stupid , we will be led like sheep to slaughter ' .	-4.4615
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-3.1043
Hogan 's staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted those who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-4.2843
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him earlier this week .	-3.1630
The staff of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivol , and the online commentary was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.2781
" It 's just Facebook , " many people said .	-2.0122
But it is important .	-0.8306
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.5701
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular .	-5.5814
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.4616
Hogan is not a reactionary hit head .	-1.8262
He has shown firm leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles .	-3.5833
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and play on his hapless head for chemotherapy on his side .	-5.2658
Therefore , blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum officially designated and paid by staff who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-5.7555
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman , Amelia Chasse , defended the actions of the governor , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation .	-3.2438
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online the whip .	-3.4185
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-8.1785
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a pastor , not a troll .	-3.5421
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profane .	-1.8314
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-1.7998
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hasserfüllt , but she asked for hate crimes .	-2.6383
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the news program " The Post " .	-3.3062
" I do not like this idea , either , when a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are disregarded by some more than a so-called collective effort , and not recognised as a large group . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.2485
What the governor 's staff called a " concentrated spam attack " would probably call " intercession . "	-4.5639
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-3.1506
It is much cleaner than in the past , if the same thing had been done , that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials , or arrest or silence protesters .	-4.7957
But that is precisely what is happening digitally .	-2.9366
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-2.5281
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.7971
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia .	-2.1980
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when she appointed a voter from her Facebook page .	-4.1887
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.1738
That should not be so difficult .	-1.6883
At the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .	-3.2263
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter-writers suggested his leadership .	-3.3369
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.5523
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-3.1692
Petitions that overwhelmed his position on the Treaty of Amity , trade , and shipping with Britain , according to the historical documents collected by the Washington Project ’ s Online Papers .	-4.8365
But he did not silence them .	-1.9640
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse form the basis of our nation .	-2.5489
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.7763
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club Club	-2.1534
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-4.1760

This event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-1.9418
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.2388

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking	-1.3945
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking .	-2.3193
This results from a study conducted by the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) .	-3.6874
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking , " said study leader Heiko Becher .	-4.0691
In comparison , he used his own study on this subject from 1994 .	-4.9312
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .	-9.4044
The new research is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-1.9066
Housing connections turn out to be very complex	-6.6723
The construction works in the Villinger street are in full swing and " are somewhat in time " , says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .	-6.0659
In the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hidden in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .	-6.9640
Traffic , which is constantly hampering construction work , is a major problem for Stumpp .	-8.9777

Papua is Indonesia 's poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst rates of infant mortality and literacy in Asia .	-2.6361
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold country .	-1.6470
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix , lies just 60 miles from Paniai , a high-land province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.7278
In 2015 alone , Freeport lost $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-2.8777
In addition , Papua has natural resources worth an estimated USD 78 billion .	-5.5392
However , these riches are a source of misery for the Papua people who ensure that Indonesia 's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence .	-3.9297

The former carpenter secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-2.9194

The shocked children told them that they should turn their spotlights on .	-4.0834
One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-3.8744
The soldiers who had drunk , chased and beat the group with their rifles , said victims and witnesses .	-3.0846
Then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children .	-2.0204
One child , 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma .	-2.6902
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escalated the next day .	-2.7935
About 1,000 young Papua men , women , and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .	-3.6506
They brought together ceremonial hunting gowns and conducted the Waita dance - in a circle constantly and a bird song imitating - by Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm .	-6.8791
Some protesters began to throw stones on police and military posts .	-3.8049
When the mood was heated , the soldier was sent a command via an internal spark : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " it is said in an official document of TIME that was not released the local media .	-5.0106
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for rest and demanded the crowd to return home .	-3.5726
Nobody was in the mood to listen .	-1.8328
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful old wooden house .	-3.4811
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .	-2.7492
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-1.8355

According to Human Rights Watch , five young protesters were killed and many more injured .	-2.1655
The news of the killings came only the following day ' filtered ' to Jakarta .	-3.5399
Three weeks , Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura , expressing sympathy for the victims ’ families , and vowing to address Papua ’ s historical grievances .	-4.1999
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in future , " he said .	-3.3477
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations .	-4.9257
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.9925
" Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago .	-3.8137
Some were in the 90s and early 2000 's .	-2.7470
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements , but there are processes that need to be enforced , " he said .	-3.7680
Then , Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-4.2045
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-2.3428
Wiranto , accused of " crimes against humanity , " which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled , including the Paniai incident .	-4.5735
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim infidelity .	-7.6291
" I have been interviewed four times in the last three years , but no progress has been made , " says Yohanes .	-3.3328

His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.0749
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .	-2.4137
" After I had buried the bodies , the military searched for me , " he says .	-2.7574
The shootings have not stopped .	-7.1562
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniais neighbourhood Deiyai .	-3.4972
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.7321
The man who was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw drowned when he fished in a nearby river died on his way to hospital .	-4.0832
Local villagers protested at the company ’ s location office .	-4.3381
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings .	-2.7081
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .	-3.2328
" We were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TIME .	-4.1068
" I hid myself two days in my house . "	-2.9258
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the police mobile brigade from the area .	-3.5272
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian Government .	-3.2870
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal living in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.2621
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.0332
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.9989
In response , thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-3.0190
Some never appear again .	-1.7580
Among the people of Papua is Paniai known as " a tragic , forgotten place .	-7.1572
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.4940
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.7347
Bread is just as much out of reach .	-2.2156
People here grow everything they eat , especially Nota and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-4.0700
Agriculture is the job of women , who can work on the four or five fields of the sweet potato .	-4.4773
They retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.4112
Ten pieces Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-2.1103
Over time , economic inequalities between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants who have arrived since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport have increased .	-4.8240
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants .	-3.3799
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own companies competitive .	-3.2605
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because here there are no jobs or money , " says John Gobai , the chair of the tribal council of Paniai .	-3.1359
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.2831
Moreover , restrictions on media coverage remain strained .	-2.6650
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given rare permission to film .	-3.8508
According to Phelim Kine , Asia ’ s deputy director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-3.4347
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia 's most troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a blacklist , " he said in a statement .	-3.7379
Lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesia ’ s government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-3.1551
In March , six Pacific States - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai Shoulder .	-4.0519
The same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.3306
The Speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Arrmanatha Nasir , rejected the group 's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' Indonesia still has a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.4969
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-2.2516
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , Jayapura visited on 4 May , local people took their silence and pressured him ' We want freedom ' , according to a source that also attended the meeting , but would remain anonymous .	-5.5866
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again .	-2.8292
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai conclusions , " says Gobai , the chair of the tribal council .	-3.7588
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .	-3.4925
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jokowi as a " guilt " he has to pay back .	-3.7895
" They don 't need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.2166
Despite the threats and intimidations , the Paniai victims ' families carried out a final symbolic act of defiance : the corpse of a victim was buried on an area just opposite the police and the military station .	-5.3981
They know that they may never get justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .	-3.4207
" A member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with a shaken head .	-3.1482

Fire captures the ' Torch ' skyscraper from Dubai for the second time	-8.3671
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai its diary and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meters high 79-storey building .	-3.6412
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in only two years , which one accidentally calls the Torch Tower ( torch tower tower ) .	-5.7109
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-1.9481
" We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and when people were shouting .	-4.8701
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor down , " a resident who told his name as George angab , Reuters .	-5.2681
Dubais civil protection authorities said that the units of firefighting against 4.00 local time ( 00.00 clock GMT ) extinguished the fire and cool the building .	-10.3035
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected .	-3.1150
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world .	-3.8822
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the fairing , exterior clothing for decoration or insulation .	-5.5086
In the United Kingdom , the police said they believe that the system of insulation and disguise panels on the London Grenfeld Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people .	-5.7460
No Davis Cup Reform : Next Best-of-five	-2.6997
The president of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has passed his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .	-4.8930
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-5.2169
This is often very long , but it is precisely for this reason that very esteemed five-part classics remain in the traditional competition .	-9.3800
63.54 % of member countries voted for the reform , so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was scarcely missed .	-4.4467
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-3.0035
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic contests , " said Haggerty .	-3.2048
We will continue to work to improve the assessment .	-3.0172
Gar did not come to the vote until after many inconsistencies the proposal was made to carry the final out in a neutral place .	-6.4728
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : for example , the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the coming year ’ s first round .	-5.8270

More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers brings prohibited items to the plane , finds a survey out .	-4.5222
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously banned items were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent of the aircraft , while accidentally banned knives or other items with blades .	-6.9898
Less than 1 % claimed that they had discovered that they were mistaken for firearms , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.0868
The survey conducted by a Jet-Charterservice , the Stratos Jet Charters Inc , found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules .	-11.1329
Of the respondents who admitted that they had knowingly tried to fly with something banned by TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % who were members of the X generation .	-4.6605
The most common items collected on TSA agents were food and liquids .	-4.2393
More than 3 % said that they knowingly carried items with blades through the security check , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately taken banned drugs to the plane .	-11.0553
The company said it had consulted travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods would have been brought through airport security and how many would have done it deliberately .	-5.9611
It is no surprise that the people who bear the most jewellery - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were those who fly most frequently .	-5.9185
However , the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.1508
People are often unsure what liquids they can take with them or how much of them .	-3.5162
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of items confiscated by TSA are prohibited liquids .	-3.2222
For a while , people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling goods .	-3.7115
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-2.5221
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders	-10.3806
Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to give with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.5831
In doing so , he has so far failed to propose that part of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-5.6243
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla ’ s head Elon Musk for the first time in announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet has a different , less glossy figure : the cancellations in the new mass market model 3 .	-8.0565
Over the past few months , Musk has often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , which is about to be delivered .	-6.2050
Now , Musk admits : Of the 518,000 pre-orders , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-4.5368
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-3.3530
In case of cancellation , Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 and UK £ 1000 ) " full refund " .	-6.9602
Currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations , Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.4773
However , Tesla ’ s leader does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 % of all orders to date could be the problem .	-8.5443
His argument : the challenge in ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-3.5999
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.5996
In 2018 , all models are to be taken together - 500,000 , 2020 one million .	-9.5936
Demand for this is obvious .	-2.1573
According to Musk there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-3.9191
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum utilization .	-7.3414
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.6174
However , if there are major delays , the non-binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-4.8432
After all , the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from going off in droves .	-4.8098
EPA ’ s head , Pruitt , is withdrawing from the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions , owing to the reluctance of the Obama-Era rules .	-6.1903
A day after he had been sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the Environmental Protection Agency ’ s chief , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants .	-5.2005
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state ’ s environmental authorities than previous .	-4.6643
He did not mention the action brought against his previous post in a federal court .	-4.0562
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-3.4720
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid " interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth . "	-3.2657
Pruitt , who had been President Donald Trump ’ s attorney at Oklahoma long ago , was a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations .	-4.6529
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulation that chemical industry and fossil-fuel industries oppose .	-4.5302
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.5358
Last month , a federal court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority by trying to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitoring and reducing methane leaks .	-5.1314
Pruitt proposed , in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , that his U-turn in ozone standards was simply the EPO ’ s willingness to work with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-5.8627
" Under previous administrations , the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " Pruitt said , who left EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.9364
" We do not believe in legal regulation , and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.8750
We also take the law and the authority that it gives us seriously . '	-2.5093
Nevertheless , the EPO 's opinion that Pruitt will at some point use its ' competence to delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on sound policies and the best available information ' .	-5.2848
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of the ozone rules .	-2.7091
A bill approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years .	-3.0565
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.5281
The New York Attorney General , Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that sued the EPO this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.6068
" The reversal of the EPO - after our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and those over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-5.4509
New York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .	-1.8594
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources respond to sunlight in the atmosphere .	-3.1838
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .	-3.2642
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-3.8150
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for air protection that we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.9306
" We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump administration to pollute itself and its particular interests . "	-3.4612

Visitors to the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-4.1323
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made friends and supporters of Tumling their concern .	-4.4625
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village jewel " .	-2.9895
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergisches Urkundenbuch in documents : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen , including the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber .	-5.8373
According to the text of the document , there was also a ruling court on the Tumlinger Berg , apart from the former parish church , to which the church or patronage law belonged and not the other way round .	-5.9179
So people lived there as well .	-2.7978
As can be seen from the description of Oberamtes Freudenstadt in 1858 , besides the Unterdorf and Oberdorf , which can still be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen , the " mountain " of the third , the ruling settlers of the village .	-5.9255
Old maps from the time around the year 1600 underpin these historical facts .	-5.1492
The patronage law originated from the early medieval church law .	-4.5244
A Lord who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church , and also inherited this church of his own .	-6.3613
This was linked to the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .	-4.7966
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-2.6212
The size of the two crumbs at Christmas 1673 .	-3.4959
The newly opened bell was first crowned in 1692 , but had to be delivered later in World War II in 1942 .	-5.6567
In the Thirty Years War ( 1616 to 1648 ) the windows were insulated and the bells were stolen .	-4.3668
The roof was leaky .	-3.1695
In 1796 , French troops moved near the church .	-2.8934
They broke the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-3.0895
Remains of the church threatened to topple in 1809 .	-3.6458
Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler .	-3.4770
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of St. Hilari was demolished .	-3.8633
Only the church tower was left standing .	-2.6328
In the New Year ’ s Eve 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .	-4.9291
In order to avoid an accident , the tower was broken .	-8.0819
Only the Turmzwerg , which still exists today , was preserved as a witness to the 750 year old church history .	-5.2682
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the " Schaffigen Rentnern " as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius facility .	-3.9996
As organiser , the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen are invited to the 6th Serenade at the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday , 16 July .	-5.7694
This is made by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-4.1507
The final word is the preacher Hartmut Romann .	-5.2919
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.8279
Decree is available from 3.30 p.m.	-4.4756
To the end of the Serenade there is a reconstruction in front of the cemetery .	-4.9137
" Enjoy a summer night under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest " , the organizers challenge the fantastic view .	-5.5815
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-2.6833
The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius facility , which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler .	-4.2792
The friends and sponsors of Tumling feel particularly committed to home care , as confirmed by Serenade organiser Walter Martini .	-3.8489
Association wants to have windmills approved	-5.0117
" Boisheim defends itself " does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore approached the Landrat .	-4.7474
The association " Boisheim defends itself " invited Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette .	-4.0227
It is illegal .	-2.1138
The association argues that , at the time the approval was issued on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved in the Nette Boisheimer , because at the time in Viersen , only one wind turbine zone existed on the city ’ s frontier with Schwalm Valley .	-7.3257
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle , but at the same time the concentration zone prevents the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area .	-5.8775
These zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being " conquered " .	-6.4307
Although the city of Viersen had decided a few days earlier to change the land use plan to a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette , the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error .	-7.2194
" Due to the lack of a planning requirement , the issued approval document remains unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim wehrt sich " .	-6.1517
Current state of affairs : The city council decided to re-open the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break ; approval of the district government is still pending .	-6.5692
Erkens : " This excludes the granting of permission for the construction of wind turbines from planning law " .	-6.3581
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.8363
" The appropriate letters have been received by the district quarter since last week , " said a speaker .	-5.8376
The circle takes it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-4.0511
However , they are not likely to stop the procedure .	-3.5309
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to speak in substance about the reasoning of the association " Boisheim defends itself " .	-7.0787
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four 200 metre high wind turbines on an area near the Nette Boisheimer .	-7.8955
Already last year , the company in which the city was involved in Viersen is closed leasing contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of large grounds .	-7.2968
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - roughly one-fifth of all four seniors ' electricity needs .	-6.2374
The NEW Re wants to invest some EUR 20 million .	-2.1911
Last summer , Viersens Stadtrat gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Windpark Linnich near Aachen , as well as for the participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg .	-8.0125
Car and tractor crashes together : Mrs dies in terrible accident	-3.7167

City and traders are planning " home shoots " weekend weekend	-4.7025
Bad Langensalzaer und Menschen aus der Region sollen im September die Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Innenstadt neu entdecken .	-2.2924
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on the 8th and 9th of September to entice the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .	-6.5047
As the chairman of the trade union , Christian König , announced , the " home shoots " weekend should raise customers ' awareness of what offers the city itself has prepared apart from the usual supermarket goods .	-8.6572
It is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .	-3.8102
Furthermore , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places .	-7.4691
In addition , the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite you to the " Mitternacht shopping area " .	-5.7225
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the region .	-5.4561
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .	-4.6809
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .	-3.7207
The trade association and the city are thus entering another stage of the ‘ Attractive City ’ project .	-6.2319
These include new offers such as the first " Active Day " to the Brunnenfest samt selling Sunday , talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively .	-5.4785
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .	-3.1366
In addition , customer potential should be reopened or re-opened .	-4.5082
This includes spa guests and tourists .	-3.1992
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre when shopping .	-9.6835
In the end , everyone would have to contribute to revitalising the city centre - right up to landlords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .	-6.0618
It was said with a network to overcome the lethargy that had spread , King said in the spring .	-4.4641
Birgit Streich , director of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , said that for the first time five Thuringian cities are taking part in the nation-wide third " home shoots " day .	-5.5696
In addition to Bad Langensalza , these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-2.4048
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities ' , so strike .	-5.9321
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her own direct environment with his / her buying behaviour .	-5.9487

A missing person was also born later .	-4.8701
The dead were employees of the school .	-2.6395

At the time of the holiday there were few people in the Minnehaha Academy building .	-4.0227
Trump , after leaked transcripts of telephone calls to Mexico , pressured the border wall ’ s payment .	-7.5480
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .	-5.8324
On January 27 , Trump , in a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , asked to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.5900
The US President insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall and reportedly said to him : ' You cannot say that to the press ' .	-5.0815
Trump started his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the US southern border , and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.0949
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-3.0560
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US would " ridicule " refugees who emigrated to Australia , " be bad " and " stupid " , and that the existence of trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a " depp " after proposing a ban on resettlement of refugees to the US .	-6.7111
Mr. Trump ended the call after having told Mr Turnbull , " that is the unpleasant call for the whole day . "	-4.1127
Moores Ford Massacre : Activists cite racist Lynchakt as a call for justice again .	-2.8617
A Ford Mercury in 1948 drove through a group of rural viewers , Monroe , Georgia , and rested on the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-6.2805
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with rifles to block his way .	-3.5983
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe - took a long train on his cigar and watched through the windscreen .	-5.1168
Drinks floated into fear .	-4.3088
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " rode the man .	-3.2527
" Get it out of the car ! "	-1.8789
Shrine torn the silence when a young black man was torn apart by the front-passenger seat .	-3.0413
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just an offsetting .	-4.1842
But if a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost all of the audience outraged very real sigh .	-5.5368
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-4.7633
No one has ever been accused of murder .	-2.5816
" It is really inconceivable that in all these years no one has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps in organizing posterity .	-4.3142
" It is a jewelry on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.9116
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a life long civil rights activist .	-3.2409
For him , offsetting serves as a dramatic call for action , and is an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.4973
" We want prosecution , we want ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , " he said .	-3.0021
" We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice . "	-2.5780
A court doctor puts a begging towel over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore ord-Lynchen on July 27 , 1946 .	-6.6114
According to FBI records received from the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process .	-3.6257
But no one has ever been charged .	-2.2359
Although the suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-4.4305
In April 1946 , a ruling by the Supreme Court allowed the citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer .	-3.9799
About at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black Farmpächter Roger Malcom stacked a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a struggle , allegedly for a woman .	-5.3772
Brooks said the rumor in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcom 's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .	-3.8606
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent White landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-2.4498
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.2072
But when they came from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , Lynchmob surrounded the car .	-4.6675
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes here a FBI report .	-2.7479
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses . "	-4.1148
Brooks worded it even more succinctly .	-2.7293
" It was an election rights massacre , " he said .	-2.1455
" They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you here . "	-3.1175
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual submission of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-4.0185
Their portrayal is vivid , touching , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America .	-6.2240
It is hard to see , and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.3484
" We do not want to talk about the Lynchen because then we will be confronted with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-4.2975
" But I can 't build a relationship with you if you don 't want to listen to me or don 't want to hear what I 've done " .	-3.5094
The samples for this year 's production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest black - moved into a room and laughed when Greene played a well-rehearsed overview of the piece .	-5.4713
Wade Marbaugh is the co-director of Greenes .	-7.2196
He has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-3.9351
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-2.3228
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-2.5722
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , the Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester tried to play their lines .	-2.5185
The piece begins with Malcom , who rides the cushion and afflicts him , furious that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-5.1999
" I said n --- he , disappearing from my property ! "	-1.9125
Rascona reciprocates fire .	-2.1116
There is a break .	-1.1927
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks into laughter .	-2.4721
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.4682
" What ? " asked Rascona .	-1.2886
It is alarming and confused .	-1.2558
Was I too tough ?	-1.4213
" No , " Greene said , still kicking .	-2.3495
" I simply do not believe that white people said then ' n --- he ' .	-8.9314
" But , " one of the other black actors zelte .	-4.2745
" You only have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-2.6916
And this is exactly where the energy shifts in the room , a feeling of comradeship replaces the unease .	-4.4783
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .	-3.3526
The scene begins again .	-1.3944
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharp and emphatically .	-3.1073
Nobody is laughing .	-2.5095
This repetition ends violent and fast .	-2.2715
There is cry , shots and then silence .	-2.5143
A woman suffering from a sorrow is above the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays mourning eulogy " Strange Fruit " .	-5.3397
Your voice breaks at every second word .	-2.9116
Approximately a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears out of their eyes .	-4.5817
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-2.3060
A couple is from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the road .	-7.4626
They have lived through Georgian humidity for nearly eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys .	-4.7531
Up to this point , the murders have remained a anecdote , but now , when you are on the same country where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels mired .	-5.4027
When the last notes of the song sound out , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name .	-2.9841
Children raised to their heads , register the falsified blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other .	-3.7239
" They are not really dead , " murmelt a little boy , as if he wanted to remember .	-6.9701
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it 's over .	-2.7283
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wipe their tears .	-7.3505
Bradshaw surrounds Marbaugh , the man in the suit who played the clan member .	-3.2356
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks into her arms weeping together , the emotional burden of performance finally breaks with him .	-4.8163
" It is okay " , whispers one of women .	-1.7672
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.8906
You did that for one reason . '	-2.1759
Later , the audience met the actors for dinner .	-4.3372
On a table a white couple from Atlanta chat about the posture with a black couple they have just met .	-6.4941
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that have left a sense of performance .	-4.1294
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you yourself and do this because they look like you , " she said .	-3.4796
" What this really does with me makes me believe that Lynchen is still going on , " she added , " today the only police shooter is called . "	-5.2906
In the same room Tyrone Brooks Hof holds at his table , he eats and recalls civil rights .	-3.4714
He said he had already started planning the performance next year .	-3.0963
" The reproduction is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.4100
" It 's so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .	-3.6894
Those who do not study their own history , those who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat it . '	-2.8447
" Götterdämmerung " reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth	-2.6482
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf also sets the scene for a colorful , frivolous staging in front of gigantic , six-sounding scenes .	-6.5551
The revolving stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) shows a shabby street corner , including Mauerrest and Dönerbude in Berlin , a " plastic and elastic " logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-5.2537

Brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .	-2.8236
Later still Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) must believe .	-2.8694
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .	-2.7544
Storms are celebrated Foster , Milling , Vinke and Dirigent Janowski , who bows humbly and the hands to the Merkel-Raute .	-6.4825
For the first time , the Festspielorchester will present itself on stage .	-7.3608
The performance of Frank Castorf and his director was eagerly awaited .	-4.4823
Had he left in 2013 a yellow arrow concert , five years later , there was great cheer in which the isolated " Buh " cries went down .	-11.7680
Katharina Wagner will have fun with it .	-5.6455
" It is noted that the audience grew up with the " ring " in a way , " she briefly said before the performance of dpa .	-5.0074
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but it was also an understanding of his view grew .	-4.0205
I draw a positive conclusion .	-2.6204

According to the United Nations , there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , some 20 % of them in the capital .	-3.0016
At the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shia district of Kabul .	-2.5080
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack .	-2.0550
On May 31 , a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people , with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack , since US troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001 .	-3.7838
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , with US President Donald Trump weighing up the number of US troops supporting , increasing , military and police forces in the country .	-3.7717
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf Ghani 's reputation .	-3.8652
EPA reverses decision to delay the Smog rule after lawsuit	-4.4099
The US Environmental Protection Agency has revoked a decision to delay the Obama administration ’ s regulation that states are obliged to curb smog-causing emissions , a day after 15 states sued the Agency for the move .	-6.4289
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to press ahead with the so-called ' Ozone provisions 2015 ' and said that it indicated the Agency 's commitment to work with states .	-5.4384
" We believe in dialogue and that we are responding to our state partners , " said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.3185
Pruitt announced in June the EPO ’ s intention to set the ozone regulations – which would measure emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards – to delay one year until October 2018 .	-6.2572
A group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-2.9444
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to roll back a wide range of environmental concerns that former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda that Trump claims to spur economic growth .	-4.7097
But efforts have triggered the Democrats ’ and nature groups ’ setback , which worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health .	-5.5365
The website of the EPO says that breathing air containing ozone " can reduce lung function and increase breathing symptoms " such as asthma .	-4.8539
Community space	-2.8522
At the end of the day , the decision was clear : with two votes against , the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a Community area in the future senior citizens ' residence .	-6.2452
Before the discussion , there is an important piece of information : The purchase contract for the missing property was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-5.1970
It is true that it will take some time before the area belonging to the church community is in the municipal district , but there is now no planning barrier to the project to be started by a private investor .	-8.7347
There is a debate on a Community area for this .	-3.9844
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .	-3.6852
On the ground floor , it would provide a living area - around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace of 70 square metres for a special price .	-4.6943
The administration and the majority of the municipal council prefer not to see such a common space as a meeting place only for residents of the senior-just residence , but openly into the community .	-8.1737
As an example , the word " knitting café " made the round .	-4.5788
The decision taken last autumn to allocate funds to the current budget will be based on support .	-7.0266
Construction is in the rehabilitation area .	-2.7932
The creation of a Community area would be , according to Tjaden , eligible for 60 % of 30 % .	-4.6652
The proposal for a decision provides for a signal to be sent to the investor that , in this respect , he does not want to throw a stick between the two , stating that both satellite - which is leaned to the environment - and the Pultdach - which reduces the grape level and makes the construction of economic power possible .	-9.5984
Needless to say , not only does Wilfried Sohmer think this addition is necessary .	-6.5611
If ' s help : unanimous he happens the body .	-4.6548
It is not as easy as the Community area .	-3.7117
Daniela reputations point to the many buildings with which we are not making such progress , for which we are now rejecting the Community area from the window , she says : ' I am struggling with this ' .	-7.5476
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area , but absolutely against local participation .	-3.8858
It sees a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .	-3.9490
That is not the case , because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant , but rather gives a real countervalue , marketable in case of doubt , is the counter-argument .	-7.2943
Staigers request that the proposal for a decision be split up accordingly , there are three advocates .	-4.7982
For example , there are two votes against the original programme that Stefan Haller sums up in this way : ' If we take the decision in this way , we are taking a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-6.0231
Collision with car : Radler is thrown on street .	-3.5104
On the road crossing , a 82-year-old cyclist was captured in Garath by a car on Wednesday and was seriously injured .	-5.1954
As the police told us , the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on the bike at 12.20 p.m. on the road Schwarzer Weg from direction Hilden .	-11.9086
The senior wanted to cross the cableway at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch .	-3.7399
A priority granted to him in the same direction as a driver travelling by car .	-5.3867

He joined a car that steered a 66-year-old woman .	-8.6045
The man was thrown onto the street .	-2.5173
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue failure .	-3.9341

" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-2.2614
The last one was not good . '	-3.2395
The 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance during the first official mandatory season .	-4.9162
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.2769
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .	-2.1871
The team is ready .	-0.8778
We want to play intelligently , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intense game " .	-2.1802

Hiking from Star to Star	-3.7116
In Harz , the first " Star Path " is to be created nationwide .	-4.6264
This is the plan of the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg .	-3.4795
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.2049
A " star-path " meets the information needs of many visitors to Harzbesucher .	-4.5994
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.7306
The members want to set up the planned route table and inform about stars and constellations .	-5.3493
In a first phase up to 2018 , the association plans " well-attainable installations at five to six locations " in Oberharz .	-4.2779
Infra-cold St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeiß and Sieber .	-2.8815
The information on the table should be supplemented by Internet .	-3.7113
This is why the location selection of a good mobile network reception has a role to play .	-5.1213
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.9672
Later , the Star Path train is to be extended by train .	-9.4046
" On the Star Path , the observer can learn a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-6.8609
In addition , they learned why stars have different colors , or why a star shines more strongly than another , even though it is much further away .	-5.5871
It will also be communicated in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see it .	-10.3461
The association has been operating the highest situated observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-3.7896
The location in the heart of the National Park Harz is one of the six darkest regions in Germany , according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation .	-4.6989
Often , the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are visible from there with the naked eye .	-4.3338
In the Uni-Stadt region , there has been something similar since 2003 on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen , as well as the planned Sternenwerg - the Planetenweg .	-10.3768
Beginning in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the Sternwarte - as well as a " extraterrestrial " site in Diemarden ( municipality of Gleichen ) with the planet Sedna .	-6.0549
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto , which is degraded to a dwarf planet at the end point - are situated exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-7.3675
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 meters away , measures 70 centimetres .	-4.7311
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres .	-3.9429
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to stele with pluto .	-3.4017
Pedestrians are faster than light in the world .	-3.2283
The march to the next fix star would take another six months .	-3.9191
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown	-1.5567
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .	-3.3933
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles , up to Garcia , the unrivalled World Boxing Council lightweight champion who went down the corridor to greet Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-Federgewicht-Champion .	-3.8741
After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for Pound-Liste .	-5.3586
Garcia stretched the right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-2.6842
I wish you good luck . '	-1.4269
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN .	-2.6056
When the couple asked for photos , Lomachenko-Manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect order of magnitude . "	-4.8314
" I am a former feather weight , " Garcia recalled .	-2.6533
" I got up for bronze [ on 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.5267
I am small for 140 .	-0.9784
I want to get down to lightweight .	-6.1625
And he must move to lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.9123
That is what fans demand .	-6.3692
Let us give them that . '	-1.4012
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.8345
" Boxes need this fight . "	-2.1957
Climate asked if it should be on Pay-per-View , part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-peach debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia ( 37-0 , 30 Knockouts ) also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight triathlon in the forum on September 23 .	-4.6269
" This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode , because all fans asked for it , " said Garcia and expressed himself later openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .	-5.1679
We are the best .	-0.7190
No other name can generate this type of attention .	-2.2506
Whenever they are ready ... "	-1.1807
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter , " and he may participate in his Saturday fight .	-4.4280
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think the tripartite Champion from Riverside look " very slow , sorry Mikey ... you wanted the Ko-Aus " .	-5.0771
Garcia said that the focus is to show strength of punch , then boxes .	-7.8243
Both said that they could sense the momentum that was building up for their own struggle .	-4.3232
" This is the fight that must be conducted .	-2.5259
No other fight will attract so much attention and enthusiasm .	-3.1336
I am more than happy to work on it , " said Garcia .	-1.6973
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that 's Mikey .	-2.7602
It will be a great fight . '	-2.0095
Four injured after Reifenplatzer	-1.5238
In an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .	-2.9006
After initial information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost the control of his vehicle at about 4.30 p.m. just before the closing point of the market .	-7.6578
The passenger carried on to the right into the Böschung , where he was swamped and then settled on the roof in the green strip .	-7.6580
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .	-2.2718
During the initial injuries caused by the rescue service , the A7 was locked to the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .	-7.1911
Fortunas Hoffmann : " Triple chain works better "	-3.0520
Andre Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season start against Braunschweig , that the optimisation of the defense formation in Aue will bring points .	-6.4327
With the first season match Andre Hoffmann was happy , with the result , there would not have been the two counterparts to the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-6.1026
" These were two counterparts too much , and we have to be even better on Aue , " says Fortuna Düsseldorf 's defender .	-5.0907
In the Ore Mountains , the triangle is also to be further optimized .	-4.7649
And a gateway to a push of free will no longer capture the fortunes .	-6.7971
" For the future , it will be the case that no more than Michael ( Rensing ) is on the line . "	-8.1542
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope with the trio even after the experience in preparation than with the Viererkette .	-7.3537
" I do not yet know how we will act in Aue , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we are building on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-4.7427
" It is a prerequisite , but that we harmonise even better and that we do not make so many abusive mistakes in the construction . " , , , etc .	-11.1120
Of course Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game .	-2.9258
" Whether or not one can speak after a decision of a failed start , does not know .	-5.5567
The performance may well be okay , " Hoffmann said .	-2.9552
" If , however , we stand by four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season start . "	-6.5317
His coach did not want to know about this .	-3.6928
" The start to the season I only judge after six to eight days of play , " Friedhelm Funkel said , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely due to an storm .	-5.8521
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann , believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher , because they don 't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favorites in the bones .	-7.0774
" But they don 't know 100 % where they are at the moment , " says Fortuna 's Home Defender .	-4.8957
The guests from the Rhineland will meet in the stadium of Aue as a light favourite on Sunday .	-6.6395
" That we sweep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is nonsense , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is positive only in a defeat against Aue from nine games .	-5.5368
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start , " says Fortuna 's chief coach .	-5.1587
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant . "	-2.5557
And so Funkel does not want to see his players on Sunday .	-3.9592
New results of the Swedish asylum age screening tests published	-4.5134
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.9862
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Agency ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) began carrying out the tests last year .	-3.2672
They are to be more precise during the asylum procedure in assessing the age after the Swedish migration authority was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage .	-6.8090
To date , migration has sent 6,880 cases to be tested , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31 , 2017 .	-4.3818
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person " may have been 18 years or older " .	-4.1489
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years old " .	-2.1949
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-3.0659
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-2.4611
" We do not see a big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.8332
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age .	-3.4848
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that " propose that the investigated person be 18 years or older " .	-3.2167
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-3.2947
The method of medical age assessment , in which X-rays were closely related to whiteness zones and MRT shots of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-6.9440
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work involves evaluating the biological maturity of humans to see if they used to go through puberty sooner or later .	-4.4156
" I had reason to think about this and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.8201
The biological age to judge this way is very uncertain .	-3.1529
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend that we could " he said the newspaper Metro .	-3.5392
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is incorrect is small . .	-8.4595
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . "	-4.4483
Full Plan	-1.0824
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.9584
On Wednesday , a seven tonne concrete section at the bridge was installed at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.4900
" We are very good at the time , it runs super " , says Reinhold Leicht , building manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Government Bureau Freiburg .	-4.7871
In April the works started at the same time on all three needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-3.8431
The end of the construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be adhered to .	-4.7401
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads over the Trombach .	-2.6725
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete covered with red stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-5.2100
It was built in 1900 .	-1.9081
Like the other two bridges , it has been in the meantime .	-3.6567
In order to ensure the stability and safety of transport , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .	-5.8978
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach .	-2.3229
They are made of red bunker stone .	-3.4564
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.60 meters long .	-2.7236
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven metric tons of so-called bridge cap on the Wednesday morning on the north side .	-6.0810
This is a fringe attachment which is also used as a working path .	-5.5750
On the southern part of the bridge a 2,20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-4.0195
That is where the pedestrian path should go .	-4.9960
The special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of Schramberger company Dizwo .	-4.2962
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-2.1178
Particular sensitivity has required the laying of wires through the construction in Lauterbach .	-5.9205
Because there is also a fibre optic cable that is connected to many companies .	-5.3988
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the works by hand .	-4.6875
In addition , fish and crayfish had to be fished first .	-7.7633
A traffic light regulates the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher towards Schramberg .	-4.1471
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher Ortseingang , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " is fully locked .	-5.2763
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000 .	-3.0183
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-2.6009
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protest bei deutschem Kartoffelsalat at	-1.3179
It does not happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , what is otherwise hard to reconcile is coming together .	-4.8179
The parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , left ) represented in the Volcanic Eifel Circle are part of a broad alliance , which this day peacefully demonstrates its flag , because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites Rondell to the " big campaign event " , according to Plakat .	-7.9923
And well-known names are coming to the fore - such as Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the deputy president , Beatrix von Storch .	-6.6678
But those who are already hours away from the beginning of the event on the ground do not want to listen to the AfD artists , but to demonstrate .	-8.0536
The motto " The Eifel remains colourful " .	-2.8205
Originally the city picnic was planned under the slogan " All at a table " on the fountain square , but now it takes place in the parking area below the toboggan track - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall .	-7.6401
A colorful image that offers itself .	-3.2229
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the authoritative organizers , rightly rejoices : " Toll , how many people here have come together " .	-4.4044
There is music and plenty of food , including a " urdeutscher Kartoffelsalat , which could also eat the AfD easily , " says the woman who brought him .	-5.0622
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , they show presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .	-4.2801
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein ?	-2.5100
Mario Hompes from the AfD volcanic ice reports that he made an effort and won the award .	-5.0498
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun , but got a cancellation there because the already built Laurentiuskirmes did not have enough parking spaces .	-5.8266
So now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.4234
With a view to the event on the Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.4821
This is also the case : at about 20 o 'clock , the Rondellvorplatz is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the rheinland-pfälzische AfD-Chairman Uwe Junge .	-8.0723
In the hall , some 200 listeners are waiting for top candidates to make their speeches for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch .	-10.9504
Unmodified is the police presence , but so far officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.0688
A little more than an hour takes the AfD event , which guests can enjoy at the Vorplatz , but there is also a short break after 9 .	-8.6067
The police can move away - no special events .	-3.2787
Posaune meets Trompete	-1.9216
A reunion with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .	-5.2496
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the slogan " Black Sea meets Black Forest " , or even " Balkan folklore " meets a classical German education with roots in the brass music .	-7.3832
Both soloists are winners and laureates of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras .	-4.3700
Thus , Petkov Solotrompeter is the acclaimed Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo songwriter of the SWR Symphonieorchester .	-7.7731
Both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the borders of the various genres .	-4.4484
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach explores the fusion of classical music , jazz and free play into a fascinating work of art in the two new , Daniel " world music " , with of , in , in , , , , in , , in , in , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , and .	-27.9064

Coe praises ' honest ' Russian apology for doping scandal	-2.8213
The world leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia to a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-admitted to sport .	-4.7246
Russian athletic director Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that banishing his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .	-5.0777
He said he was sorry for " all the athletes who were kidnapped in competitions of gold and silver medals " .	-5.6161
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-2.9973
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe the reporters .	-2.3584
" The entire council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is redesigned . "	-5.1919
Coe said he was also ' pleased ' that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction .	-2.7271
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to restore Russia , " Coe said .	-3.2660
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation .	-2.6541
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the deceased system , " he added .	-2.5484

The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security precautions .	-2.8037

The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried beside his wife after his death .	-2.9050
That was what the royal house said on Thursday .	-4.2290
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple is placed in the cathedral of Roskilde .	-3.8525
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already completed a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.6600
The queen agrees with the decision of her husband , it continued in the notice .	-9.9932
Where Prince Henrik is buried is not yet clear .	-2.7156
But he has no intention of being settled in his French homeland .	-4.1568
Prince Henrik never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .	-3.0022
After the insult of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .	-3.8524
In 2016 , he retired , including " Prince Choice . "	-8.4151
As Henrik did not get the title and function in Denmark , which he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief spokesman of the Danish royal house , declared .	-6.3336
Where the last retirements of the 83-year-old will ultimately be , is not yet clear .	-4.0332
However , he did not intend to be settled in his French homeland , but in Denmark .	-4.3353
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .	-2.4950

Prime Minister Weil wants a quick re-election	-5.5606
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony	-2.6299
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country after the loss of the red-green majority in government , but he does not want to step down .	-5.8323
Because on Friday the resolution of Parliament was expressed .	-4.8002
Prior to this , the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had toppled Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-5.8957
Five months before the official date of the country 's election , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-4.6182
The previous Green MEP Elke Twesten founded her step with non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-4.3169
" I see my political future in the CDU " , she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-2.0911
CDU Group Chairman Björn Thümler wishes to recommend that his group accept them .	-4.0052
The CDU and FDP would thus have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag , SPD , and Green 68 seats .	-5.0633
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-2.5586
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on January 14 , next year .	-5.2551
Thümler said that the country ’ s red-green government must now decide whether to govern without a majority in this situation .	-4.2249
Stephan Weil , however , considers it essential that the day of the land should be resolved as soon as possible .	-5.5398
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-2.9902
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the day of the country deprives the Prime Minister of trust and elects a successor .	-5.6371
" Our constitution offers several options .	-2.1773
These opportunities need to be investigated legally ' , said Thümler .	-4.0212
" You will discuss all the issues in peace if they are legally sound audited . "	-10.4659
Thümler described Twestens Schritt " doch etwas kurios " .	-3.1315
The politician herself said : ' I am not a traitor .	-2.6975
I feel very good . '	-1.5186
She called herself a follower of Black Green .	-3.9688
The Greens called for the disgraceful Members to return their parliamentary mandate .	-4.7386
" We assume , of course , that she will immediately return her country mandate , which she received via the green list of the country , " said Chairman Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-7.7063
The group chairmen of the Greens , Anja Piel , said : ' We deeply regret the decision of Elke Twesten ' .	-3.9674
You have deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group .	-3.0759
" Even against the background that there were no substantive differences , we cannot understand this step . "	-4.2348
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason .	-3.6088
" The behaviour of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters , but also betrayal of Red Green , " wrote the Bundeschef of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .	-4.3784
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s decision ( SPD ) to allow the country ’ s day to be .	-4.2363
Leaving Twestens costs Rot-Grün in Lower Saxony the majority .	-3.4552
In her injured vanity and in her frustration , the politician puts her personal interests before the welfare of the country , " criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-5.0369
" It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue and is trying to make it political capital . "	-9.6845
Niedersachsens CDU-Fraktionschef Björn Thümler wants to recommend his deputy to include Elke Twesten in the CDU .	-4.6946
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 election .	-4.8746
The CDU was then the strongest force in the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the parliament .	-4.7316
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoners , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.8614
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-1.2949
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.6304
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.3319
Agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) speech and answer .	-3.9153
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves against poisoned eggs ?	-1.9184
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .	-3.4397
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected egg chargers .	-5.3031
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.4349
Even if , as we now know , health risks are virtually excluded .	-4.6932
Is Aldi now taking the best possible crisis response - all the eggs from the offer - because the central role of the enlightenment of the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs is not really being perceived ?	-6.7890
Food monitoring is a task for the Länder .	-3.1677
Nevertheless , my House has sounded up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the German concern .	-6.0102
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.3582
Trade , like manufacturers , has to ensure that the products sold are safe for both transport and health .	-9.7869
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded in the case of eggs , they are not capable of transport .	-5.1390
However , contaminated eggs can be sold and consumed .	-2.7796
This time , it is not the businesses that are to blame .	-2.8510
Do production plants and consumers sit on the same boat ?	-2.9072
As it stands , manufacturing companies are not directly blamed .	-4.7857
On the contrary , they are liable for economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-5.1823
As always , there is too little control in the event of a harvest .	-3.9786
Is it only for the staff or for the consistent competence ?	-5.6583
It was the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.8947
However , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out at 100 % .	-3.1513
It is precisely for this reason that such events and the handover to public prosecutors are consistent in cases where crimes can be committed that are of crucial importance .	-5.9815
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide full information .	-3.6276
Is it really necessary to regularly alert food scandals ?	-3.6080
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and safe foods .	-9.5578
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-3.5338
The money that has been pumped into this situation means that manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in absolutely no need of it .	-6.9214
As a matter of principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of life-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-5.8086
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .	-3.9228
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the facts quickly and fully .	-4.0503
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-2.5402
The rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars World Record Transfer from Barcelona , Spain , to Saint Germain , France .	-4.3224
Any consequences will still arise for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA , because the leading organisation that oversaw the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-4.7137
Financial Fair-Play rules , created in 2011 by UEFA , mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses .	-4.5591
Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and Neymar will receive a salary of $ 10 million per year .	-3.8700
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France .	-2.0415
PSG can certainly make money loose so that Neymar submits it to a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy rich family of rulers of Qatar .	-5.4105
clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but they must counteract legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break points in their soccer business .	-6.2675
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007 .	-3.0161
Former French players believed that if banks or owners withdrew their support , clubs that had made huge debts in their quest for success had effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves .	-4.9676
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on the club ’ s debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.9066
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a tougher business .	-4.1836
During the current three-year FFP publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .	-4.7910
And , while Platini has fallen from the presidency in Ungnade in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , remains committed to discouraging excessive spending .	-3.4869
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future still , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible at the UEFA for FFP , vis-à-vis The Associated Press last week .	-3.6603
Although the PSG has paid Neymar 's buy-out in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the invoicing over the duration of its contract .	-4.3325
Neymar has signed a five-year contract , so that the transfer fees for the next five years can be reported at EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts .	-5.3076
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , which owns Manchester City , has hit the hardest sanctions .	-3.3221
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .	-5.0753
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to over-list their financial supervision by raising their revenue through companies linked to the owners of a club .	-5.6464
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates , the UEFA would not consider this legitimate income .	-3.7940
That is what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.8156
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .	-3.5719
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and that such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could be easy to find .	-4.3622
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.2049
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.0336
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.3429
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than € 10 million in 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of € 542.4 million .	-8.5002
The accounts for the last fiscal year still have to be published .	-2.8921
PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising and jerseys .	-2.6203
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing .	-3.5404
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players , and it tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.4416
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the president of the La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's eventual ownership of PSG .	-12.1515
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is owned by an American sports coons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club .	-3.4713
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.8127
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-1.8500
It is going to be very difficult to respect the financial fair play , because you can have different ways or different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-5.1787
Swiss is on the lookout for a new shoe supplier . . . . . . . . . . . .	-8.4339
In recent years , Chocolat Frey Bord-Choade has produced for the Swiss .	-6.2704
Now the sweet cooperation is coming to an end : the airline is rewriting the order .	-4.7095
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper " Nordwestschweiz " from Friday .	-3.4010
According to current plans , the airline will sign a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.9716
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-3.2252
" With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied , " said the spokesman .	-2.8196
Some 17 million small , red-white shoggy boxes weighing 14 grams per year accompany the flight prior to landing on the passengers .	-8.7414
The Swiss did not want to disclose the costs .	-3.6186
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to " Northwest Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros-Tochter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs .	-5.1364
But the advertising effect is more important : for a shoe manufacturer , it is a prestigious order .	-4.7883
Like many applicants in the new call for tenders , the Swiss does not want to betra.	-4.3597
But only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-3.5437
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey is seeking to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 . . , , , and , the , , , , , , ,	-8.2714
For the sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not reachable for an opinion .	-9.9250
Chocolate tables have been distributed on board their flights since 2006 .	-3.1452
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary , Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug .	-4.5090
The possibility to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.2721
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.6038
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are pampered with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli , Business Class Nest passengers Schoggi of Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey .	-4.5714

Nostalgia goes to " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " to the niche .	-2.6284
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of characters of the 80s , for the 90-year-old Grunge era ( as the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV turned ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things .	-4.9452
As a cultural artefact , it is also a parody and embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-2.9724
But as a franchise , it feels like time is running out .	-3.0668
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a talking can vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.3638
By jumping to the heart of the gag - actors of middle age play horny children who are awakened - they still managed to regain the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke .	-6.4117
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults who now play adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more by the casting principle , including a reef to the Stalker movies of the 90s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that looks the cradle " ) .	-5.2132
At one point , a character through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.2169
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.1466
The loving Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now novelist , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-3.1848
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.3852
And there is another crazy malicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan ( including Mr. Showalter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-4.0896
As always , the courses are the best part of the franchise .	-3.4876
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , who Matt Dillon 's lower lip bart of " Singles " shows , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old boy .	-5.0417
There are the moments random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeating " Seven Up ! " series until it reaches what I assume as its logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the gang how it will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-5.7264
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War by " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East-West wrestling iconography .	-3.9991
The comedy with Rhys Thomas , created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka as director , indicates to be a tied TV series : a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , fighting for truth , atheism and the way of Marxis-Leninism .	-4.9998
The main roles - a hard-anointed Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues of Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English .	-4.3812
It 's a brilliant idea .	-6.5982
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.2831
There are some nice gags to watch ( the police spend the time watching Chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-3.8986
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game ' Find the voice ' .	-2.7212
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one .	-3.6458
In six long episodes , it moves , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-4.2994
" Comrade Detective " , which has been edited to a lesser length , could better deliver its agitprop sounding , as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers .	-6.0600
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything into a fodder for a voyage .	-4.2968
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong : we are even doing it with our own recent history and with theirs .	-3.0948
Beating the Drug Mafia in the Land	-3.3243
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-2.8759
On Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Baar district , in Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , such as the Public Prosecutor 's Office Konstanz on Friday morning .	-5.0064
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 years and 77 and have already issued arrest warrants against them .	-4.8601
Moreover , officials ensured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine , firearms , and several hundred thousand euros .	-3.2033
At the same time raids in Italy , two people were arrested .	-2.4381
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects .	-3.4330
The two are therefore likely to be shipped to Germany .	-2.8913
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators .	-1.9590
More than 300 police officers were deployed .	-3.0487
Members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder and robbery and blackmail .	-4.3329
Since the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office has been identifying consistency against organized drug trafficking in the southern German region .	-5.2288
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-3.5083
As a result , the large-scale deployment on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four Palermo officials .	-4.1108
Ins Visier of the investigations made especially Italian citizens with close reference to the Italian mafia .	-6.4404
Also a incident on May 27 in huts where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning should go to the band 's account .	-6.3674
Thus , large gaps in the foreigner register are lamented .	-5.6298
'Data from citizens who should not appear ' : according to one report , the country register in Germany shows significant shortcomings .	-5.3963
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures .	-4.1404
According to the Federal Government ’ s refugee management commissioner , Frank-Jürgen Weise , a media report has drawn attention to major gaps in the foreign central register .	-4.6816
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to serious errors in asylum procedures and expulsions ' , warned in an analysis available to the ' Süddeutsche Zeitung ' .	-5.9389
According to the register , 10 million people are of foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.7842
The data are therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.6625
Because the data has not been maintained sufficiently , data quality in parts has not been good .	-5.0147
In individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , ' of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register any more ' .	-5.1477
" Flawed data inputs can slow down returns significantly , " says the report .	-5.6187
In the statistics on people who are subject to emigration , it is covered by EU citizens who do not need to travel .	-7.1204
Such false assignments , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with travellers ' fleets , so it is in the analysis .	-7.6254
Meanwhile , the federal government seems to have begun sending refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children when they have arrived .	-4.3108
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , which reports on the " New Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-3.9124
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is resuming such procedures ' with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-6.5827
Since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually impossible , according to the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.7063
According to the Dublin Agreement , the responsibility for refugees lies with the EU State , which they first reach .	-4.4475
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that country can return him to the country of entry .	-3.6767
The explanatory statement now reads : ' Meanwhile , the absorption capacity of families with underage children in Italy has increased substantially ' .	-5.9047
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.9562
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.4442
Other EU countries , too , would send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement .	-3.4067
The internal political spokesman of the Left Group in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticized this decision : " Families with children are threatening to become a threat to the welfare of children because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system .	-6.9726
The Second Best Result	-3.0519
A total of 220 litres of blood in Oberreichenbach provided blood donation services to other people .	-3.7489
At least 12 citizens who were awarded the prize on Friday .	-3.9588
All the way to Jürgen Greule , who has now shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations .	-6.2461
Traditionally , the community pays several times the willingness to donate blood at the municipal council meeting .	-4.7766
" It is ingenious how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood to strangers , even to the unselfish " , underlined mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.7631
" A single blood donation helps several people , " explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the preserves are broken up into their constituents .	-5.1837
Three people could already benefit from blood donation .	-3.8300
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in spring .	-3.8880
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK team leader .	-3.7175
Obviously , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .	-4.4808
Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each .	-3.6792
Half as many are booked Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave 10 times each 500 milliliters of their life juice .	-4.3191
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.2872
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation dampened speculation about an increase .	-3.6268
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it reinforces interest rates on family income in the midst of intensifying pressure .	-4.7095
Monetary Committee policymakers ( MPC ) agreed to keep interest rates at 0.25 % , with less members rising this month , as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase .	-4.4448
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % , and for 2018 to 1.6 % , warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % this autumn .	-8.9748
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to rein in inflation fueled by Brexit , and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.5916
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic package that was issued a year ago after Brexit .	-3.0423
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £ 15 billion more under this system - £ 115 billion sterling .	-5.1097
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the central forecast of MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption . "	-4.7394
On interest rates , she reiterated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and ' a somewhat larger ' extent than the markets expect .	-6.1104
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-9.0876
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " gradual " and " limited " .	-3.0239
The Bank ’ s downward growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % , compared to the forecast in May .	-3.7366
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.0944
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news .	-2.6669
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 , and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-2.1632
The decision to change does not come after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest-rate hike , and GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months .	-4.5823
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , though it will easily recover after the Bank ’ s demise at the end of the year .	-5.0190
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage increases , as tightening becomes even worse before it gets better .	-4.9230
She added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " income collapse in the next few years , but she added that wages will recover significantly at the end of their three-year forecast .	-10.6374
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending .	-3.6732
The decision comes a year after the cut in interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound ’ s fall .	-3.7733
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve this fully in terms of prices and the economy .	-4.1503
Before the Bank ’ s last ruling on interest-rate rates , the call for an interest-rate hike had risen , as inflation pushed pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding a 0.5 % increase in July .	-5.5744
Inflation fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , although the bank said that this was expected and that it would rebound in the coming months .	-4.3569
The bank said that exceeding the 2 % target is ' very ' to the weak pound .	-4.9536
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders are clamoring for business and want to end the year in a positive way .	-5.0027
The market looks particularly good for those who are running out of existing deals and closing new mortgages , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more popular . '	-4.8326
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people .	-2.9281
Patients will have access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September onwards , following a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the NHS drug .	-5.6376
NHS England announced that pre-sexual exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk opiates by about 86 % , is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-5.6329
He agreed to fund the process after last year 's appeal court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-4.6013
The chessboard announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS UK chief Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this " decisive moment " .	-4.7035
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and more clinics will follow in October , before it is introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.9496
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.2591
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious patients .	-2.2775
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .	-3.6922
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-3.8540
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .	-3.2877
In clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.6361
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-4.2710
The programme will be £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .	-4.4059
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is used , absorbed , and implemented on a large scale .	-4.9767
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.1414
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity 's greatest health challenges . "	-3.6467
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-1.5600
PrEP , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.7134
From September to September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is genuinely individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which will lead to the improvement of many , many lives .	-4.9653
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.5198
Ian Green , CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority now has to be to carry out the study quickly across the country , and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind .	-4.0225
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured , we are on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . "	-4.1336
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government .	-4.0921
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.2117
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-2.2861
It is now important for this study to be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and to help us move closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . '	-4.9334
The big life : Upstairs and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-3.8687
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shrank from a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-3.1550
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold .	-3.2645
" Before that I lived with my ex-in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-3.1685
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .	-2.4653
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .	-2.1978
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . "	-3.2787
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken .	-4.4880
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne Stauraum wanted to add a mezzanine to make the most of the spacious ceilings .	-5.1267
" I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light .	-1.6964
That was my requirement ' , she says .	-2.7573
To this end , she commissioned the Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill , which uses 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.6046
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand .	-4.3838
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-2.1055
" The steel mill is quite complicated " , he explains .	-2.8080
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked together , without us having to sit down .	-5.8385
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of attaching the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . "	-5.0748
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .	-4.6774
For the mezzanine , a classic copper window looks down from Retrouvius over the glamorous living area .	-4.7084
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.5963
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .	-2.1603
At both ends , a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer .	-4.0365
In the kitchen the reflection feels like a window into another room .	-3.4761
The entrance offers divided units for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-4.6664
By perceiving a glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.5978
Combinable kitchens are nothing new .	-1.6880
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.8078
" A bit of engineering went in there , " explains Erfan of the stahlverstärkten , furnierten MDF door .	-4.1917
" It is counterbalanced , so if you push the door high , it slides very easily . "	-4.1879
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.0734
" At the end of the day you will sell the base floor - or as your property is estimated " , says Erfan .	-3.0479
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the ground . "	-4.0878
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor and simultaneously use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .	-5.4670
" The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-2.9418
" You don 't lose yourself in the electric sockets in the walls .	-3.2200
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . "	-2.0942
It shows that an apartment can turn itself into something quite amazing by means of good design and increased square metre number of something standard .	-5.5164
Indeed , as Joanne , you could decide not to leave this .	-2.2326
Brothers fight for a $ 500 million property empire	-3.2794
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a dispute over one of Victorias ’ largest property imperials worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.3607
The former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared .	-4.5515
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-4.6484
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 homes worth more than $ half a billion , since the family acquired a business in Smith Street , Collingwood , in 1973 .	-3.9740
There , the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.7791
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.5904
This money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb .	-4.0841
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of corporate assets and Paul about one-third .	-4.4265
A court ruling says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million worth and Paul owns $ 176 million .	-4.5355
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.7311
" The departments proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was best for the objects , " he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015 .	-7.1639
Last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed mediations .	-3.2359
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - as Colin , as Paul claims , ruled out .	-4.9610
Colin argues that this is not true , but rather accuses Paul of managing some ownership incompetence .	-3.6227
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-3.0303
" My Italian inheritance dictates that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-6.5458
The costs are rising in the case of hundreds of pages of affidavits , e-mails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and both sides of the Anwaltskanzleien .	-5.1524
De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950 's and bought a Brunswick store in the early 1970 's .	-4.7736
They used security to buy the Collingwood property , where Colin opened the first family jetty .	-4.2300
Colin says that he began Westco there when he was " in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.0771
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons amicably .	-2.7737
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , " she wrote .	-2.1637
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies , claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when leaving the company .	-4.3510
Both Luke and Mark , Paul says , have become embittered by the terms of their financial separation .	-4.1163
Colin has been very reticent , even though he was a former AFL board member , and after a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire , the best friend of television star .	-5.5999
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.2847
Only Colin answered by SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case before the courts is .	-3.5180
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.8552
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court in a letter that he had tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands .	-3.1673
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I in our current dispute would end , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.6726
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.2253
" Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts , " wrote Colin .	-2.2618
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to curtail the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.3650
Others tried it and failed .	-2.2014
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .	-2.2537
If so , he will be the first .	-1.2321
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of keeping the head on a more even course .	-3.9318
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.7750
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met with senior employees on his first day at work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : poor information that falls into the hands of the president .	-4.8138
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . '	-3.9284
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.9403
President Trump ’ s television relationship dates back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.1591
" If Trump had been angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs to be persuaded , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .	-5.6594
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady praise " .	-4.0889
Okay .	-0.4659
But the idea that Trump 's Twitter habit has ever been " under control " is ridiculous .	-1.9290
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Trump ’ s tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions .	-3.6875
We will probably never hear about the tweets Trump has not sent .	-2.8724
If his staff were able to keep him away from him several times , their efforts would have been worthwhile .	-6.0688
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-2.1259
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.9401
Politico - quite preoccupied with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide questionable information to the president for strategic reasons .	-4.0093
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.5080
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump , like a volcano , can respond to negative press clips , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is keen to figure out where they come from .	-4.7394
Exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone blatantly printed a copy of an article of GotNews.com , the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , gave the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh accused of being " the source behind a pile of leaks " in the White House .	-4.6128
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or has not provided concrete evidence , or has made false accusations in the past , and has revoked them .	-5.4552
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh . "	-2.1958
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff , Reince Priebus , and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives . "	-7.8218
How did this work ?	-1.5974
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .	-1.6564
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-3.1023
These immutable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.0765
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol	-2.7618
Since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be inherited and hoped .	-4.6509
The police all over Europe send in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .	-4.0744
Since the addresses of the wanted swordsmen are not known by their nature , references from the population are hoped and requested .	-6.7623
Europol reported on Friday of the action that follows on the " EU Most Wanted " Advent Calendar of winter .	-3.8088
Experience has shown that many fugitives are hiding in holiday destinations , as Europol has said .	-4.5134
You have put together 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries .	-2.9773
Since 2016 , the web site www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .	-3.3765
36 of the online searches have been recorded so far , at least eleven of them due to references after the publication on the website .	-6.1376
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the ' Millions ' series '	-9.1145
Some of Midlands ’ wealthiest homeowners are once again faced with some determined travelers on warfare , who negotiated a burial excavated by the community to reclaim a field from their homes .	-7.9653
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous road of Solihull , called the " Millions Series " .	-3.6303
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May , but without being deterred by a trench excavated by the Council , in order to prevent their incursions .	-5.5810
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unbridled to find a way .	-4.4333
Angry residents have afflicted the Solihull Council , which said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.6238
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They moved there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-4.7894
The Council must indeed be forced to implement it , because it has been useless in dealing with the problem .	-4.4525
Travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back .	-9.5706
More came last night , probably even more today . "	-3.0705
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by keeping long instructions to protect its parks .	-3.8937
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.4518
A resident who did not want to be called said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of this traveller just to be plundered by another round .	-4.1722
The numbers have increased this time and even a horse has been seen in the parking area . '	-4.1023
A spokesman of the Council of Solihull said : " We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls .	-5.5113
In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-3.8356
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court has to examine when we submit our case . '	-3.8842
From Birkenhof , Waldhotel Luise	-3.0093
From the former Hotel Birkenhof , the Waldhotel Luise will be .	-3.8832
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.5405
This is good news for the city .	-1.4086
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and income was also lost by the spa tax .	-5.7560
In the autumn of 2014 , given the dramatic increase in the number of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collection accommodation , causing controversial discussions .	-6.9903
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.4775
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council .	-3.3373
But , above all , Freudenstadt ’ s Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and spoke of serious interests in the house back then .	-5.6743
He should be right .	-1.7671
The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back into a three-star Plus category hotel under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-6.0347
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object .	-2.6191
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.2056
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise . .	-9.7104
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in building waste containers for a long time , and when you enter the house , you will see how extensive renovations are being carried out .	-7.7969
The floors were removed , ceilings were partially dismantled , old bathtubs were removed from the rooms .	-4.7059
The entire hotel building is a single building .	-2.8348
There is still much to be done by March .	-2.1321
" It is actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.4825
Everything is to be renewed in Black Forest style .	-2.8291
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed .	-4.3321
Everything should later become " beautiful to the citizen " , as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-3.9077
" We want to make a jewelry on the outside " .	-3.5672
Swimming pool , spa area and meeting room are all equipped .	-4.2100
You don 't want to position yourself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but already at an elevated inner city level , Scherer emphasizes .	-5.8342
The Waldhotel Luise , with its 60 rooms , wants to broaden , explains Scherer further .	-4.7723
Both individual holidaymakers , groups and business people should feel at home in the hotel .	-7.7678
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause have already led him , so Scherer .	-3.2766
The city 's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .	-4.6213
" We are on the same line . "	-1.1340
After the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to commit himself to it .	-5.6052
Nearly under a million euro , he expects .	-4.7068
The exterior units are also mounted on the front , which is already clearly visible .	-5.4524
There is a large terrace in an inner courtyard , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-5.1913
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.2703
Russia affair : US Special Counsel sets Grand Jury	-4.9087
In US President Donald Trump ’ s Russia affair , Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-3.8641
Over the past few weeks , the panel has begun work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , referring to people who are familiar with the .	-6.4903
The newspaper regarded the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations .	-3.9242
The CNN reported that there are already initial charges from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-4.0263
US intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for some time of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-3.9622
Mueller is investigating whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.5859
The investigation focuses on several men acting as Republican advisers in the campaign .	-4.7524
Mueller reportedly also looked more and more at Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.5888
The " Washington Post " wrote a few weeks ago that the special counsel had personally moved Trump into the center and investigated the charge of possibly obstructing the judiciary as the affair proceeded .	-6.2454
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be made .	-4.6888
Grand Jurys are therefore also called prosecution chambers .	-3.3395
Usually they are switched on when there are major and controversial cases .	-4.2748
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors .	-1.9409
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to interrogate under oath .	-5.5567
According to CNN , charges have already been issued to turn the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.4544
People who took part in the meeting were invited to say that it was in the report .	-4.4182
They should also provide documents .	-1.4887
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , as well as his former campaign chief , Paul Manafort , were in the discussion .	-4.6792
Speaking on Thursday evening on US television , legal experts said that the idea that Mueller should not be intimidated in his work and that , if necessary , he should act quickly .	-5.3498
However , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge .	-5.2413
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the start of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-5.0089
Amid the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-3.7325
" The Russia story is a total invention , " Trump said .	-2.4534
The subject gives the democrats a chance to ' feel good because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-3.7113
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion , he knew nothing of the setting up of a Grand Jury .	-4.3779
But he also usually worked in secret , he emphasized .	-5.4834
The White House is in favour of any measures that could ' fairly ' speed up the work of the special counsel .	-6.8925
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it would not be investigated against the president .	-3.3871
There is no reason to believe that something has changed , so the statement went on .	-4.7989
But Mueller was not deployed until Trump fired Comey .	-2.4797
Trump ’ s accusations of smoking have become loud , and he wants to impede the judiciary .	-7.0078
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.2879
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.5743
According to the US media , the White House collected material against the Special Counsel and his staff .	-7.2147
That triggered speculation about whether Trump wants Mueller to be released .	-7.3955
Unlike an independent congressional envoy , such as President Richard Nixon , who later resigned in the Watergate affair , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at urging the president from the Ministry of Justice .	-5.1118
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.7022
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday , according to which the special counsel could not be dismissed as .	-5.6237
Antarctica : Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica	-3.0915
In the West Antarctic a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has solved itself from the chess .	-5.8370
This was done by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-4.2351
The colossus , which weighs more than one trillion tons and covers 5800 square kilometres , is now going north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-5.6514
It has a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , one of the largest ice giants to have registered researchers over the past three decades .	-4.2953
A danger to people does not come from him .	-4.1658
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear , according to research .	-3.6700
In total , however , there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice cuffs in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a factor background .	-5.1635
According to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .	-8.1805
The now broken colossus was part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-10.6249
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.6993
As a result , it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down .	-5.5286
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.6144
To the north of this haggling was the balance of guards and abortions disturbed a few years ago .	-6.1152
A complete shank was destroyed there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-4.4630
There is a lot to be said for the fact that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger , because the front edge has never gone as far as it is now .	-7.1799
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and can be broken down if a key spot is broken off .	-8.4553
The melting of hawks and icebergs does not raise sea levels , as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it does after melting itself .	-6.5594
However , the loss of the hawk means that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .	-5.7484
This may raise sea levels , but only to a small extent , the UK research project to monitor Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-4.6965
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shaft feis in the Antarctic , according to AWI data , with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .	-9.0282
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .	-3.4278
It regularly breaks down there .	-2.5415
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.3046
" This is the broadest withdrawal since the beginning of the records , " he also confirmed .	-3.6845
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly fall together , said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added : " Our models say that it will be less stable " .	-6.4689
But this will take decades .	-1.8749
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , in recent decades many icebergs of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen .	-4.6584
This long cistern of the Antarctic stretches towards South America .	-3.3546
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the Arctic Peninsula 's ice surface has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-4.6186
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline .	-3.2507
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years , making it one of the fastest growing areas in the world .	-5.0626
CDU wants domestic tariffs for personnel	-3.9711
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant jobs , the CDU is calling for employers ' association to become more attractive .	-5.1285
Just before the summer recess , the District Day marked 41 new posts in the administration .	-4.6360
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the Mettmann district administration .	-2.8587
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .	-3.5493
The teachers at the circle are obviously very much in demand .	-4.5071
Some 620 applications were available for the places to be awarded this year .	-4.6509
However , there is still a shortage of staff to deal with the increased demands and tasks .	-4.7816
There are currently 50 vacancies for Mettmann .	-3.3214
Among others doctors and engineers as well as general administration are invited .	-5.8121
The CDU now wants to join the FDP and the UWG in taking the initiative to counter the shortage of skilled workers in administration .	-5.5501
According to the parties ' wishes , the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development .	-6.4987
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers , but to counteract the scarcity of candidates in the future , that is to say , . , , , and . , , , and . , , , and . . , . . . .	-14.5532
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented , show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive , demand CDU , FDP and UWG .	-4.7005
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.2905
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems , which were previously not known .	-4.5123
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .	-2.7115
There is talk of genuine ' competition between public employers ' .	-3.5821
This includes a large number of employees who retire from the service due to illness or age .	-5.0925
It is therefore time to act , so that no more jobs are left unfilled .	-6.0760
But Klaus-Dieter Völker , CDU leader , goes further than the joint motion with his party .	-3.8384
He recently caused a fuzzy surprise in the circle for a faustdicke , when he publicly questioned staffing costs and hid the other parties .	-7.9015
Peoples want all options to be reviewed to allow exit from the municipal employers ’ association .	-5.9907
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the neighbouring towns - should aim for a house tariff , " said peoples .	-7.1542
By doing so , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service collective bargaining system actually provides .	-5.6471
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .	-6.6102
But the tasks of the circle have grown in recent years .	-2.6352
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Law .	-5.0463
Not least by increasing the number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-3.5198
Italy ’ s Tone for NGO Migrant Rescue Boats	-3.4741
Italy has warned NGOs that if they do not abide by new rules for their operations , they must not continue to do so .	-4.1460
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-3.0442
Minniti 's warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation ' Jugend Rettet ' , because their team had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-8.5652
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-5.0917
" For us , and remains the salvation of human life our top priority , so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-4.7379
" We can only judge all allegations that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and have been able to assess the situation . "	-4.9088
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Rettet ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.9847
It is suspected that his crew will take hose boat migrants on board , which will be delivered directly by human traffickers , and that smugglers will be able to leave so that ships can be used again .	-5.8614
At least one such meeting took place allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the file of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media .	-4.3354
The occupation is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian coastguard , the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-4.6056
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-3.2734
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search-and-rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-6.8313
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not entail ' substantial changes or disabilities ' in their bailouts .	-4.6312
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organization Médecins sans Frontières ( MSF ) .	-2.3971
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue operations has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.8130
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.6407
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.1266
Goes and Trials	-1.8639
Neun Weilermer Biker , the " Berliner Außenposten " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy four days of trials and sights .	-4.5086
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose .	-4.1497
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-3.1695
The Castle and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.7278
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim .	-3.1182
It was followed by lookout points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pfälzer Forest and the upstream plains .	-7.0058
In between , there have been repeated increases for which long trials have been rewarded .	-5.5677
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-3.0799
Once again , lookout points lookout point , connected by " flowige " trials and moderate increases .	-8.5850
On the last two days many vertical meters were again called .	-5.4686
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shopping huts brought welcome breaks .	-2.9264
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers breathe a holistic salvation in the open-air inhalatory .	-4.1891
Neustadt was also taxed .	-3.8397
After 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 metres of altitude , the group had experienced the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporting and cultural .	-5.6628
Konsole statt Rasen - Bundesliga rüstet sich für E-Sport	-2.6583
Do the sports stars in the future meet in front of computer consoles , instead of having to compete with the stadiums in wind and weather ?	-9.5111
Fakt is : E-Sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high Gagen inclusive .	-4.3948
This was also recognised by the first Bundesliga leagues , which are increasingly engaged in this area .	-5.0999
In early 2015 , VfL Wolfsburg , later the FC Schalke 04 , and later the VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sports department in mid-July , made two profits for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .	-6.3602
" We hope to inspire very new young target groups for the VfB , " says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-4.2071
He is sure " that on this train still several clubs ascend " .	-3.6884
Next weekend , the Football World Association FIFA will organize the first Interactive Club World Cup in London , where gamers from different clubs compete against each other .	-5.9331
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven , for example , have qualified .	-3.4895
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-2.0311
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.9814
" Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year old in particular , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-5.8277
And : The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian ones .	-3.1311
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , you could be present on these markets far more frequently online than just once a year to send the Bundesliga team to Asia .	-6.1725
What is this all about ?	-2.1238
In e-sports , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or even the soccer simulation FIFA are contested at competitive level .	-5.0796
For a long time , like in normal sports , leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .	-6.1270
And in Asia ’ s 2022 , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-3.1015
But is it really a good sport ?	-3.1613
For many , the idea is certainly habitual .	-4.1703
Ingo Froböse , too , has long been grappling with the question .	-7.3046
For the professor at the German Sports High School in Cologne , e-sport is a sport because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions which can also be found in classical sport - for example increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.5361
It also requires cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and rapid responsiveness .	-3.2964
Professional gamers should not only train at the console , but also train their bodies and watch for nutrition .	-9.1146
" The fitte player is a good player . "	-1.8249
But frogs also see problems : " doping is becoming more and more an issue " .	-3.6485
Controls are difficult to implement in online games , and the structures of classical sport were lacking in the scene .	-5.3620
On the positive side , the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-4.0809
The players are on the international stage , which is like a large global family , as there are no intercultural barriers .	-5.0474
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverbandes Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts that e-sport will lead to rapid growth .	-4.4500
In 2016 , Germany implemented € 50 million , mainly through advertising , sponsorship , and major tournaments .	-3.5179
In three years , sales will be 130 million .	-3.4066
Of course , the Euro 2.4 billion of the football league is not enough .	-6.1035
However , the E-Sport " is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , writing the Dell consultants .	-5.0968
Many countries are already international .	-2.3361
Large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-3.1980
Hollywood-Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn .	-1.8766
Europe is also doing something .	-3.1070
In a Norwegian school e-sport was introduced as a subject , says Froböse .	-3.3303
In the Netherlands and France , the first-league football clubs , according to Dutt , are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-3.8864
" In European comparison , Germany is lagging behind , " explains VfB board Röttgermann .	-4.2826
To fall into nostalgia alone , and to shrink old times , is no longer enough today .	-4.8241
It is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association , but also of aligning the company on the modern market .	-4.3302
" We live in a digitised world , " says Dutt .	-2.2044
" You cannot hold on to the fact that only in football everything remains as it has always been . "	-5.6980
Poison eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking	-3.0381
The scandal surrounding poisoned eggs now affects almost all the federal states .	-9.2171
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and are selling all eggs throughout Germany .	-3.9640
In the shelves only eggs are to be taken , which are demonstrably not contained in a fipronil .	-6.6376
Michelle Carter , for the texts that Conrad Roy urges to commit suicide , condemns him .	-7.6214
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend through texts and calls for suicide .	-2.5536
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation .	-2.9794
Carter was convicted in June for negligent killing Conrad Roy , who died on July 13 , 2014 .	-3.4619
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : " My family is untröstlich .	-3.3940
My son was my best friend . '	-0.9793
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .	-3.7892
She was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .	-3.5999
In red pants and a creamy blouse dressed , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and looking down as she was condemned .	-8.9045
" Your actions have killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.1964
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-2.2270
She did not take responsibility , " she said .	-3.0599
" She has shown no remorse " .	-2.3642
But Carter 's lawyer said that it was a ' terrible circumstance that she completely regrets ' .	-4.3883
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not find out that her " age or maturity , or even her mental illness , have a significant influence on their actions . "	-3.9746
A prosecutor read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy , saying that there is " no day on which I did not consider the loss of my beloved son .	-4.1976
I would like him to be proud of me and , like me , to deal with everything .	-5.0822
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she was being persecuted by the realization that she would never participate in her brother 's wedding or be a aunt for his children .	-4.0893
" Not to have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will keep for the rest of my life always with me , " she said .	-4.4896
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.8147
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle .	-2.2357
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-3.2281
" Hang yourself on , spring from a building , get yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.9462
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : " You have to do Conrad " and " All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy " .	-4.0543

Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the new Mini Lahm of FC Bayern Bayern	-1.9963
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .	-2.8815
The FC Bayern does not trust the Confed-Cup winner to have a big season - extra motivation does not harm .	-5.9951
Something was different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even if the additional garment was very , very small .	-3.6666
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer was to see , he made himself the connected to the arm .	-5.2141
" The trainer did not announce it , " the Confed-Cup winner narrated afterwards , after his first bet as a Bayern-chapter .	-6.0113
Good , the booth could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.6719
But the sign from Coach could also interpret Kimmich this way .	-8.8199
Not the eight-year old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the leader of the existing C-Elf in the holidays of youth players , debutants and professionals .	-8.6919
Sugar distribution is most popular among those who are suspicious of what they want to keep at Laune .	-7.1138
So anyone who has been chosen to attack the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra-motivation .	-6.2544
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want to take on as a player : responsibility " .	-3.7823
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old fled the field as a mini-lamb .	-3.1251
Right at the back , this is now his position , the white string at the arm did its rest .	-5.6730
And in this startup formation , as the one who can best take the rudder in his hand .	-8.3305
He gave instructions to try to steer the unused force .	-4.1610
He had a look at the whole thing , while many others were concerned with themselves .	-4.8579
Vidal so that his lack of fitness to play ( sounded hardly ) ; Renato Sanches so that on devil come out to make the achievements of the Asia trip ( sounded also conditional ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot did not fall negative .	-7.1920
That , after all , worked very well .	-3.4589
Süle ran beside Kimmich , Rudy in front of the defense , both acting sovereign .	-3.3040
The namesake Napoli Sturm often struggled , and additionally , scapegoats tried to succeed in the construction of the game a few times .	-7.4598
His colleague , Mr Rudy , admitted that the result was not as we hoped it would be .	-3.4129
But he also showed a decent performance in the debut .	-3.0932
Moving games , changing tempo : " For this style I was also fetched " .	-5.2643
Like uninhabited this Bavarian world is still accessible to the newcomers , one looked at the game afterwards .	-6.4624
Rudy , for example , did not give in the catacombs one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .	-3.3099
Kimmich went on to say a few sticking words in the back of his new fellow players .	-6.6913
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What has been done here , I have already noticed .	-5.2850
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game " .	-3.6788
After all , he no longer needs to teach the new .	-3.0729

Companies are satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate ministers : Economics praises Wissings Tempo	-3.9881
It was often uncommon , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-4.3193
This is evident more than a year after the new Economics Minister Volker Wissing ( FDP ) took office .	-4.4044
Chambers and companies from the region speak at T V 's request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time pocket the old minister .	-5.5720
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy on which Lemke has blocked all " .	-4.5165
The biggest about-turn is in infrastructure policy : the bridge between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s priority list .	-4.7616
This year , the Ministry is still hoping for a planning procedure until 2021 .	-4.3797
A role in the country ’ s plans is also played by the West circumvention of Trier , which anticipates the federal transport route ’ s urgent needs .	-6.7844
The goal is to get the track operational in December 2020 , says Minister interlocutor Cornelia Holtmann .	-5.5532
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-7.6749
The Chamber of Commerce ( IHK ) Trier is striving to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been going on for ten years .	-5.8652
Moreover , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , praises the IHK .	-4.5713
The Handwerkskammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master coach , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.7527
In the first place , a premium of EUR 1000 for the best master examination and EUR 2500 for graduates who are self-employed within ten years of their master .	-8.7269
The house list for the country remains long .	-3.7949
In the planned road construction , facts are to be created quickly , at the same time , the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , chief executive of the IHK Trier .	-6.5901
Of the 56 new engineers who want to employ Wissing at the state operation Mobility , only 29 positions have been filled so far .	-6.8608
The IHK requests to assign more orders to external offices .	-3.4233
Christian Baldauf , a CDU group member , points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than € 20 million less in maintaining highways in 2017 and 2018 than proposed .	-4.9767
Frank Natus also expects a concept of how the country intends to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-5.0324
It is also sobering to see the expansion of broadband in the country .	-5.7722
In 2016 , regional companies assessed net coverage in an IHK poll with only the 3.4 mark .	-9.8998
They complain about stocking Internet connections and declines .	-3.3096
On the other hand , former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .	-4.9529
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where , after four months of disagreements , it already cleared the field .	-4.6004
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash .	-4.0406
A day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.3648
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - prohibiting or restricting diesel vehicles .	-5.1979
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.3541
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall .	-3.4712
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-3.2611
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.3995
The cost to car manufacturers of equipment for neutralising exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.1802
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-2.5473
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen 's mistakes , which could regulate the use of so-called switchgear , emissions , in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .	-6.7524
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.2856
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-3.1741
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-2.6405
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was extended .	-4.4314
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen 's profit .	-3.8038
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar .	-4.3979
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.6279
So that the Isar visitors also participate , on Saturday a raft rides through Munich , which has a special message .	-6.7343
On Saturday , once again , the Isar is pulling , which will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbach bridge .	-7.4460
And that is not a usual thing , with Isar tourists .	-3.9692
Special reference will clarify this .	-3.8829

Mordillos Knollennasen and laughter at the suffering	-3.3864
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon artists , who are the bones of his characters are his trademark .	-5.9990
Also with 85 the Argentine still draws and works on a film .	-4.2811
His message : laugh , " because there is too much suffering in the world " .	-2.0270
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-2.3362
In the first years as an artist , he was among others a draftsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him .	-7.2028
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-2.0454
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.9918
Even in China Mordillo found many fans .	-1.4525
Again and again , the artists were inspired by cities .	-4.3443
Great , round Mordillo figures meld in drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .	-3.7995
In the early morning , according to his own data , he is still in the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-5.7081
Over calendars , puzzles , books for adults and children , t-shirts , plushy toys and watches , its drollings continue to spread around the world .	-5.8069
For six years he has worked on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .	-3.8800
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousandth of feet as an opponent .	-4.4779
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to be released in 2019 on the cinema . are . , , , , and , , . , , ,	-9.6970
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it 's strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.1611
The script is not written by him .	-1.2607
This is why he is more interested in the TV series , which , like his original recordings , is wortlos produced .	-9.2218
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change	-1.8906
It has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .	-2.4194
The lavender is falling because of drought-like conditions and the diseases of infectious insects , causing great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-6.1120
Eric Chaisse , expert in agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which brought much less rain in the spring and in the autumn much more .	-4.3945
This has an effect on the lifetime of lavender .	-2.5197
There is also a small cicada , a microbaktery that weathers dwarf cicadas , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . "	-9.9560
And there is a lot at stake .	-2.0380
Lavender soldering not only attracts holidaymakers , but also perfumes and cosmetics are very much in demand .	-5.6180
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-4.0172
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.8100
The solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness .	-4.6858
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary this year .	-2.7944

Herbs , guilds , traders , vagabonds or a local slayer should be in the city centre these days .	-7.3263
The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico	-2.2813
The Riodoce workers typically meet on Wednesday to review their reporting plans for the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime , corrupt officials , and interminable drug wars .	-5.9390
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.3368
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.0730
Two senior journalists are discussing what is more secure : they are to take their children to the office , which was the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-5.3763
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .	-3.6942
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , perceptions and belly feelings are enough .	-4.5422
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s payroll or the cartel , a catalogue of criminals making Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous .	-4.0427
There is no respite from violence , and while the bodies are accumulating across the country , more and more journalists are in the process : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , with 589 under attack and threats from the federal police , and so far , there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-6.5444
Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration of Riodoce , co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.2070
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .	-2.7972
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his middle finger with the word " Justice " hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-4.6170
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .	-2.3034
Although a special office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , only two criminal proceedings have been initiated .	-5.0311
As with most thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year , journalists ’ killers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.9408
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating Sinaloa ’ s violence , even though it is inherently rosy , and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous .	-5.8338
Without information on the murderers , without justice , the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security , says Ibarra .	-3.5186
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.6757
" As long as we don 't know why , we mistrust everyone . "	-2.9768
On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan .	-2.8029
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks far before his roter Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men .	-4.8675
The shooter drove in his car and damaged it near .	-3.1692
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.7743
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.4271
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan .	-3.1383
But on the subject of Valdez , there is practically nothing but silence .	-3.5977
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , with rival factions struggling to fill the vacuum .	-3.3833
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living .	-4.5604
Forget for a minute that there is a state of " rest " if only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States .	-3.5833
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .	-3.0180
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.6207
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.5360
This publication may have annoyed the sons , guessed Gangmitglieder bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-3.9434
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave his own security after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story .	-3.4265
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.1503
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-3.2378
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold USD 50 holdings .	-4.7741
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to practise journalism without encountering the drugs problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.3487
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and revenue and advertising increased .	-7.5743
Reporters loved to be able to publish tough inquiries without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat .	-3.8069
Eight years after Riodoce was founded , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Award " for her coverage in Latin America .	-3.1005
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in tracking Mexican drug history wherever it went .	-4.4314
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.5247
" I want to live on , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.4689
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a lifestyle , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV .	-2.1221
" You must take on the task that you as a journalist - either you or you play the fool .	-5.0310
I do not want to be asked : " What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? "	-3.5701
The Riodoce team mixes Valdez , the Spaßvogel , who like a dockworker could flood , the friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-4.1743
They relied on their routine .	-2.9928
He would always wear his hat .	-1.0934
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-2.7880
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his abusers ?	-3.8773
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive .	-3.8922
" They don 't like to be bothered by women , their children , their clean shops , their homely runways , and drugs .	-6.6011
" These things were not allowed " , said Bojorquez .	-1.6304
The result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.1605
Trust your own instincts .	-2.1459
If it is wrong , stay away from it .	-2.6594
The trouble is said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier " .	-3.5215
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials are at home .	-3.2430
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.3217
In the space in which Riodoce ’ s staff met for security training , no phones were suddenly allowed ; days earlier , it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.3739
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-3.0240
They were tasked by the state government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-4.3650
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were 50 % of the policemen who described the governor himself as untrustworthy .	-4.2013
It has been months since the reporters moved to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-4.1511
For this week 's edition , Riodoce has clicked on three main stories .	-3.8608
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.8314
They also had an exposé on state expenditure , which focused on the hometown of the governor .	-3.8336
And there was a group that conducted a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office .	-3.5913
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so it was prudent to write at the time what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.6147
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which ruled almost the entire century all political levels .	-3.5262
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high-profile cases .	-3.0908
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military raid .	-3.0845
Only a few months earlier , readers would have regarded Valdez ’ s column as the best informed source of abduction .	-3.6218
" Earlier we would have known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body stature .	-3.5380
" Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . "	-2.2577
Valdez ’ s office has been devoted to storing signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .	-5.2145
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few characters and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-3.8788
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.0742
A burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.2598
Throughout the country , journalists have become more vocal by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on pay and construction sites .	-5.2030
On this day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-4.0118
At a meeting with Sinaloa Governor on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and making them kill because they told the truth .	-3.5307
She has since asked that she be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-4.0820
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials involved and an equal society .	-3.7515
In his last book " Narco-Journalism " he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs , but also by politicians and security forces who organized crime under a cover .	-4.5640
The media guard group " Articulo 19 " last year allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .	-3.6630
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-3.6211
Evidently , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.2826
No one forgets the death of Maria Elizabeth Macias , the blogger in Tamaulipas , the northern border state , six years ago .	-3.2133
Your body was found together with a note supposedly signed by the Zeta Kartel : " Here I am because of my reports . "	-3.6410
A computer keyboard and headphones next to their separated head .	-3.6675
Some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-8.6894
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was assassinated in 2004 .	-6.1575
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline " What do you want from us ? "	-4.4578
Some journalists have fled their home countries , or even the country .	-2.8738
It is a painful decision .	-0.8807
It is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.7972
And sometimes they are hunted , as the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who , together with four women , was apparently murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015 .	-3.9957
For those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-2.6843
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking frightens him .	-2.7559
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a reporter , " he said .	-2.3948
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer as once all their phones began to pour .	-5.8515
A series of shootings with bands and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .	-4.8619
The war escalated further , as promised by a series of cartel alliances in the region .	-2.5427
From the brick edge they have published the news on the site of Riodoce via mobile phone .	-3.6776
The front page had to be changed the next day .	-1.9635
Sirene was near - another shooting in the area .	-5.0645
Bojorquez threw a glance at the policemen who kept the guard to see if they were ready .	-3.6830
If they were even afraid , they did not .	-2.6111
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible throughout Sinaloa , the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps .	-4.6441
" Like you can only think of closing " , said Bojorquez , " when on the same day that Javier was murdered , the interns asked me to send them to report on the street . "	-4.6238
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade his enemies .	-2.4298
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.8110
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as " Mona Lisa the Dinosaur " .	-8.1446
It was so well received that they could even find that his scary skin was of Roman brown - and they said they had had something of a " troubled past . "	-5.5603
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " described it as " the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world " .	-4.1395
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.5455
His unbelievably well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as ' truly remarkable ' .	-4.7612
According to reports in National Geographic , the plant-fed animal is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-4.5923
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was in Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-2.9789
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .	-4.1058
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology .	-2.3647
They spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth clumps .	-3.4913
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.2888
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to see .	-3.9330
" It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs " .	-4.0413
Researchers have found that this herbivore , though covered with armor and resembled a wall tank , was likely threatened by dinosaurs eating meat .	-5.2474
The highly armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as a counter-burial used by many modern animals .	-5.0580
This would have allowed him to meddle better in his environment and avoid his enemies , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-5.0086
The 110 million year old family creature Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-4.1317
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it .	-7.7550
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body .	-4.5894
They discovered the conqueror shading , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-8.6920
Although the shading of the cones is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today .	-4.5702
It points out that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from eating dinosaurs , that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-9.2169
But most contemporary animals that use shading - think of roe , zebra , or girdle - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , indicating that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival .	-5.3329
" Strong predator behavior on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the chalk time , " Brown said .	-4.3303
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown .	-1.9132
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life , including his preserved intestinal substance , to find out what it eaten as his last meal .	-8.3767
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was driven into a river and into the sea , where he sank on the back to the seabed .	-3.4753
At that time , Alberta was as warm as southern florida today , and rivers and oceans are probably much more inland than they are today .	-3.5618
" This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , " Brown said .	-4.7325
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in early chalk time .	-3.8075
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it .	-3.4575
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs drained the earth .	-3.9289
Although the king of them , the tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was driven by some of his fearsome ancestors .	-3.2146
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tonnes heavier monsters .	-3.0967
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Borealopelta was contaminated after death in the sea and mummified in mud .	-3.5214
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was in Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-3.0160
According to the museum it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snout to the hip .	-3.1801
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.6555
It contained two 20-inch long tips that drove his shoulders .	-4.1939
Researchers believe that the pillaged herbivores were swamped by Western Canada until an overflow river flooded it into the open sea .	-5.4290
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail .	-3.5401
The buried remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains are still hollow pancereal plates along the dinosaur cover .	-10.3186
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as ' rare as a profit in the lottery .	-3.0671
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.4042
Auctionnal remnants of the skin still cover the hollow panels that carry the skull of the animal .	-5.8563
His right forefoot is on his side , his five fingers are spun upwards .	-4.0909
I can count the scales at his sole . '	-3.1830
In the thunderstorm : mass-carambolage on A8 : Many injured	-2.6732
The accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-5.3623
There are many injured , kilometres of congestion and suitcases .	-3.8033
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) about 20 people were injured at a mass carambolage late on Thursday afternoon .	-10.3808
According to the first data from the police , approximately 5 p.m. between the connection points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district Aichach-Friedberg ) during a thunderstorm , almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , were transported elsewhere .	-7.1586
The exact number of injuries was initially not specified .	-5.2315
It was easy to deal with serious injuries , said a police officer .	-4.4214
A large array of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .	-5.3815
The A8 was completely closed to Munich .	-2.6639
In Fahrtrichtung München , a backlog of about ten kilometres was formed .	-5.3075
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also numerous suitcases on the counter-track to massive disabilities .	-5.9210
The fire brigade noted the signs of the drivers who now face severe penalties .	-5.7575
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.8052
It was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger .	-3.9886
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .	-2.5820
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in " .	-2.2697
It is a moment that almost everyone has seen before : nothing can be seen sitting in the train and sleeping .	-6.6051
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .	-3.7246
And then : pufff .	-1.1100
If the Schaffner and wecks an ungentle or rides the passenger out of the workflow .	-6.6467
Passport control .	-3.1747
But the interruptions are soon over .	-2.3802
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the duty-free ticket control system .	-4.5044
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus devalue the ticket .	-4.4968
Currently a test operation runs on two lines .	-3.6811
" Come on offer , we extend it .	-4.4902
It will probably be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , " said a rail speaker .	-4.8260
" Comfort Check-in " calls the train the ticket depreciation without Schaffner .	-4.4174
To use them , however , you have to meet some requirements : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-5.1419
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers do anyway .	-4.1175
You also have to buy the DB Navigator via the train 's App , which is anyway the most convenient way to book your ticket .	-5.7520
Last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-3.0343
Because the " comfort check-in " works like this : you get into the train , call his ticket under " My tickets " .	-5.4466
A button for electronic evaluation will appear on the test customers .	-5.5170
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that Fahrgast X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-4.0172
If the train attendant arrives at the ticket control at Platz Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already depreciated online-ticket .	-7.0242
We can therefore continue to sleep , to continue working , to remain silent .	-4.3416
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers .	-4.5086
" If you want to travel without ticket control through our train attendant staff , simply check in at DB Navigator .	-6.2142
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time on the train , " says Michael Peterson , CEO of DB Fernverkehr .	-4.5912
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-4.2301
If you travel by train often , you know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest problems .	-7.4675
Because you often do not have all the documents you need to upgrade your online-tickets , even if you are travelling with you .	-7.0224
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document that must be provided .	-5.3899
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , which leads to a bad mood in the part or the large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and puts the Schaffner at the end of the day to take care of other concerns .	-12.3424
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.6548
And that also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections .	-3.4939
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated .	-3.9469
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Whose Streets ? "	-2.6589
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-1.8531
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , sat in St. Louis prayer on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.8263
She stumbled over a post of someone from the High School .	-2.3639
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " he said .	-3.7163
Confused because no one else had posted the information on their feed , they closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.8386
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah has been constantly betting on their timeline .	-3.9361
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was in the process of killing Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo . , live to tweet .	-3.3909
He postulated an image of browns lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .	-4.7153
" That 's wild " , Ferrell thought .	-2.6203
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.7090
She used her mobile to return to Tweets later in the evening via people on the Canfield-Drive .	-5.6419
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and of a man who claimed to be a father of browns who bore a sign with the inscription : " Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-5.0664
She observed a live feed , with a policeman standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog .	-4.1004
In another video , she said she escaped another policeman 's gun and shouted : " I 'll kill you ... all animals . "	-3.7042
" This is not common " , Ferrell recalled her statement .	-3.0391
" This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . "	-3.5389
At this moment I felt chilled .	-3.0784
I was angry and wept . '	-1.6671
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-2.0981
After landing at 23 : 00 she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-4.5135
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from 11 .	-3.4502
It is a story of survival and protest , of love and loss , of strength and resilience , which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.2074
When Ferrell with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , went to Ferguson , the two promised a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state .	-5.0229
" You only remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-4.0052
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-2.9103
I could not take her with me , " Ferrell said later .	-7.1356
" What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past .	-2.5543
It needs to know and see it and it needs to be raised in it .	-4.6670
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution know what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves .	-4.2261
Even though I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black child of women .	-5.2182
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it . '	-3.8945
The first station they arrived in Ferguson was located on the South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a campground when activists waited for the potential non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson .	-5.6902
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .	-4.0399
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.2179
Slowly , a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell .	-2.2014
" My activism has changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St . Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.5184
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.6102
Everything has happened . '	-2.2264
Weeks later Ferrell arrived during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.8555
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.8587
A question came Ferrell to mind : " Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? "	-4.6324
This skepticism has been fed by countless cases of people , often white , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.6208
As Folayan recently stated in an interview : " We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centralise their votes and we wanted to do it differently . "	-3.7903
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism rum around death tract inmates .	-3.6450
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-4.3425
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us .	-2.2630
" That was the main thing for me , how these people are presented , because that is how I will be presented . "	-4.4861
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-3.8575
As a result , documents from " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-4.1030
" I felt naked , " Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-2.0656
" But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people . "	-4.4414
Moreover , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement .	-2.5378
Two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify as gay .	-3.5868
" Black , gay women in managerial positions have carried the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-4.4696
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.8620
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.8419
It insists , however , that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-6.4911
" She was the person who stirred up this energy , " she said .	-2.7557
" It is no coincidence , although she was on the front line , because in a life at these crossings stands as a black , gay woman so much at stake .	-4.7554
You can feel their energy through the screen . "	-2.8666
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist . .	-7.7432
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.2891
She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-3.4631
However , she clings to a song and feels bound to this memory since she took to the street three years ago in Ferguson .	-4.9959
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.0795
It is our duty to win .	-0.9799
We must love and support each other .	-2.0987
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-1.7369
From " dream " to " megalomania " : TV readers discuss bit-gallery gallery	-3.0665
The Bit Gallery moves people , although it is far from being built .	-3.1328
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing since the first presentation 2009 the population in favor and opponents .	-3.8806
Calculates the subject hardly any .	-5.8558
Also on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " the topic is discussed .	-2.7428
While some say to the Bit Gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be real class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , others say : " Do not need a person " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply " megalomania ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-5.3407
While advocates are counting on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , which also benefits the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will blow out .	-7.4270
In addition , the gallery is planned on the very site where the farmhouse stands , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-6.1193
At the beginning of the construction work will be finished .	-5.2021
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside .	-4.8647
Simone Zimmer : " We have been buying a farm house for many years almost weekly .	-8.8574
Our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the countrymen , are always very happy .	-6.5271
We have also discovered the butchery for ourselves .	-3.9771
We would like to see this offer maintained during and above all after the construction of the gallery .	-4.1383
In other cities , there is .	-3.6267
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting . "	-2.4505
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketing takes place in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent rises .	-5.1870
The new project is unlikely to be very low . '	-5.4895
Eva Kilic : " Wozu Einkaufspaläste in Bitburg ?	-1.3398
Whether clothing , shoes , drug or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-3.8540
There is already enough of this in our city .	-3.1290
You can see how many shops there are empty - some for months and years .	-4.6357
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall .	-4.2185
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly directly offered by the producer , and are actually worth the price .	-6.7316
As you can see , retail stores are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer .	-5.9415
It is a pity that there are no more special shops and that what remains of them will probably disappear . '	-7.6121
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not suit me .	-2.9891
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-2.2454
Above all , where is the farm market hall going to go during the construction period ?	-4.9479
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the Bit Gallery actually comes at some point .	-4.3057
Or is Bit-Gallery the spectre of selling all the shops from Bitburg ?	-8.7596
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-2.1032
And a shopping center that is empty also needs no one .	-3.9853
In my opinion , it would have been better to promote a proper farm market , rather than this gallery .	-3.7796
But for a farm market hall gib it is thanks to the insane many - like I find - useless construction projects in Bitburg no longer place any more .	-5.8696
When the farmers ' market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear . '	-4.3916
A fitting similarity : in Portraits , artist Chelsea Mannings creates DNA	-3.3942
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , almost imperceptible - hanging on cables of the ceiling .	-3.9034
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarschnitten , who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-2.5953
Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after reporting secretly classified diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website .	-5.1501
The new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A fitting similarity ) .	-3.7231
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Manning , a Transfrau and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-4.7621
Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits how someone could look with these genomic data , a sharp , if somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity .	-4.7373
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but who has been speaking openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was convicted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six breaches of the espionage law , computer fraud , and theft .	-4.7960
Through the prison her image was suppressed , so much so that there was only one photo - a granular , black and white fever , in which man clearly sits on a driver 's seat and carries a platinum wig - with which she was associated .	-6.6498
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came to terms with the great success of her 2012-project Stranger Visions .	-3.3887
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette mutilation and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people might look .	-5.0047
This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine .	-2.5321
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning , while in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-2.9110
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.9108
The artists and their imprisoned muse became unequal friends of letters , who exchanged letters over the course of two years .	-4.9669
They even created a " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , who foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-3.6264
The fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , calling for the release of seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-4.5110
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new tweet-capable ways to unleash the inflexible divisions that he was supposed to address . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.1632
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-2.6438
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning , with her oversized signature ( the " i " in her family name is endowed with a heart ) , demanded an end to the " automatic fragmentation based on gender , race , sexuality and culture " .	-5.6573
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-3.1975
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show , by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) , how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-4.2831
" What people hopefully will take away from it is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-4.1083
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these 30 stories are " .	-2.7688
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel .	-8.2707
She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free phone in the hands of the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong .	-5.3999
" When they make your speech cold , they have won , " it says .	-4.1224
" So never stop the mouth " .	-2.2204
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets Philadelphia .	-3.8066
" I still get goose watching when I talk about it . "	-3.3311
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , by their own genomic simulacles , which merge like hordes of protesters .	-12.2519
This was also targeted , as everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Statur ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-4.1978
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.4129
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that also had behind its liberation . "	-3.9051

The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , after several stitches died .	-3.5682
A Community Warning System published by the Chicago Police Agency states that the corpse was discovered on July 27 .	-10.6012
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.5228
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead on the spot of the event , and detective investigated the Stiche as murder , while the police actively searched for the two suspects , officials said .	-5.5507
Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-1.9246
Alan K. Cubbage , the vice president of university relations , said in an email statement that Lathem has now been certified and excluded from the Campus of Northwestern University .	-4.3803
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-2.7533
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.5150
A spokesman of the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that " we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible . "	-4.1100
The statement added that Warren 's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .	-3.3986
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Guglielmi , said he urged suspects to face the authorities .	-3.6147
" The police has an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them , reinforce themselves , " Guglielmi said .	-3.4861
Guglielmi said that local , regional , and national authorities help to find the suspects .	-2.1509
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand-Plaza building , who had just received a enigmatic tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.8020
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.1033
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July .	-2.2267
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.0554
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " Guglielmi said .	-1.6212
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : " The police is currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-4.3848
" We will finalize the WADA roadmap in the near future " - Russian Deputy Premier Mutko	-7.5957
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) are implemented .	-3.8625
" In a certain stage of fulfilling the roadmap criteria , RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.2787
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.7521
The PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of WADA to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the site of the organization .	-3.7987
According to Mutko , he contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia .	-3.6120
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-2.1146
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.1965
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation carried out by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.2315
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : ' We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-6.4686
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.4836
But there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . "	-3.4584
Mutko ’ s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission .	-2.9047
In talks with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations , then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.6547
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally , " added Smirnov .	-2.9018
In November 2015 , RUSADA was ruled out by the WADA ’ s doping scandal of carrying out doping checks in Russia .	-3.8777
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.7227
After visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is " moving in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-4.6577
Aldi does not sell eggs anymore .	-2.9203
That divided the business groups .	-3.3121
It was a purely precautionary measure and it could not be considered to have any effect on health .	-7.2716
From now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fiprone anti-Läusemittel .	-7.3412
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers .	-4.0566
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber .	-3.1154
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employee 's happiness with your e-commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .	-3.7150
Answers were often vague , little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent .	-2.3299
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.9465
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-2.3341
It has called people from outside to help .	-7.3924
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is on the guard to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.5348
Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee 's commitment , it allows companies to perform surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases allow whistleblowern to circumvent the C-Suite managers and address directly to the management board .	-5.9995
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools is used by companies to measure employees commitment .	-3.0159
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-3.1541
In addition to the snap-polls and surveys of certain teams , it offers a hit card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can check why .	-4.9037
Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals , since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished .	-4.7783
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.8255
Global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Financial Website Let 's Talk Payments .	-3.4078
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent bad behavior and recognize a rising interest and activity early this year amid the Uber case in discredit .	-3.9704
Convercent has nearly 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.1617
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-1.9101
Like Glint , Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made " pulse " surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-5.1375
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.1140
And if the Chief Executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-3.3236
" The court of public opinion has captured regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , founder and CEO of Convercent .	-2.7014
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotts , employee turnover and suits , Quinlan said .	-5.3253
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .	-4.7190
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.4717
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints from employees .	-2.6882
Now that the company employs Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair internships - can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-5.0034
" I can come closer to this holistic , 360 degree view in experience with employment , " said Vitrano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.1240
" And we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . "	-2.8723
Companies began taking ethics , values , and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after Arthur Andersen ’ s accounting firm collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-4.4080
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty linen went online .	-2.9808
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.6305
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service , and burden companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-3.5365
It is a business model and an opportunity that attracts the consent of Venture Capital investors , both of whom have supported start-ups .	-3.6491
Convercent received $ 10 million in February financing from firms like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising total capital to $ 47 million .	-2.8825
Glitcer secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners , bringing its total financing to $ 60 million .	-3.5732
These investments hardly come as a surprise , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture , and venture capital .	-2.5280
There is a growing set of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have so far .	-4.8697
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only sales .	-3.0119
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.3311
" If people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.9723
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies go well .	-3.7683
If the analytics tools promise third parties to increase the commitment and commitment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.3922
The data on employee engagement after the experts of the workplace culture important .	-4.6623
But the data are useless if managers of a company do not take action .	-3.0392
Indeed , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-2.9734
And if change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can cultivate disappointments and workers . . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.2277
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data .	-4.1748
" Because if you will not follow employees ask themselves , " Do you really hear me ?	-4.3944
Do you care ?	-1.9307
And whom do you not care about why should I ? "	-3.4995
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , has been able to take action on the same day , if a problem is reported about Glint , so Errett .	-3.9603
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , she was able to reorganize several teams within the company through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , and add a communication training to address the problems .	-4.5196
At Ruby Tuesday , the company always has new insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this will lead to a better bond between employees in an industry that is known for high sales .	-6.7209
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.7065
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.7373
And if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .	-2.0111
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for breaking into the two-day practice .	-3.5123
There is a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus at 11 p.m. . , and . , , , and . , , , , , , ,	-12.2666
Some have pulled out their jerseys and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-3.4274
For a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .	-2.8143
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 .	-4.9675
" This is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday .	-4.1380
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually prolonged its days - at least until the final on Friday . , . , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.8421
Therefore , the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of players .	-7.7204
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day on which the break moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Western wood practical exercises .	-5.9890
In the course of August 18 exercises are to be held , 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-7.0007
Mora said that he supports the change in the rules of the NCAA , even if they add another point to the busy routing of players .	-5.1506
" We place this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , " Mora said .	-2.7386
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to plack , they are great people .	-4.2082
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . '	-3.1851
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which , given the clear lines of its fields of a adjacent parking and adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of high class that has already been covered with footballs that will be a safety net behind a gate post , will not be an easy task .	-6.5363
Bruins players are expected to fill the hotel this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are vacant during the season .	-8.7941
" We will use our security , " Mora said .	-2.1388
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to draw an exercise .	-4.2023
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is quite a good deal .	-2.7608
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8th .	-3.7407
We will do the best we can with what we have .	-2.0738
I am therefore not very concerned .	-3.0982
We have a plan . '	-0.8957
Facebook wants to intensify fact-finding in the fight against counterfeit news	-7.8541
Facebook wants to send more potential articles to fact-checking auditors from third parties and then display their results under the original entry , said the world 's largest online social network on Thursday .	-6.0965
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible wrinkles and to send them to fact-checking auditors who may display the results of the fact-checking from the original article .	-5.5597
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main points of defense for so-called fake news , many of which believe that it has also affected the 2016 US presidential election .	-4.2604
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supporting a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to eliminate hastily filled postings as they did before the elections there in September .	-5.4303
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new fact-checking will be launched .	-4.0231
" In addition to recognizing what stories are challenged by fake auditors of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-4.2571
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the " related article " and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages .	-3.1860
Creating a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.2035
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s .	-5.1319
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-4.0735
" I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says weeping .	-4.2101
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . "	-2.3073
' A Castle in England ' spans from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney .	-4.7185
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : He wrote 2014 's Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional .	-2.8123
" I only responded to the thumbprints on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 's , who worked for the Jakobiner , " he says .	-4.7154
" This is his thumbprint !	-2.8828
And letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was lit because of the light .	-4.2512
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if it were himself .	-4.4829
Oh , I love archives ! "	-1.3399
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( " To be honest : I have overvalued my welcome greeting " ) this seems all too beautiful to be true .	-4.8801
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the monastic hymns on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tomb .	-4.9517
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape patrons , gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-4.5613
Then , at night he drank " whiskey and began to write " .	-1.9498
Scotney 's intimate history is relatively unknown , as the National Trust gained full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.5420
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees began to look after the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , put it on the roof " .	-5.2737
Tagebücher , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that depict who possessed what : " One might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-4.8358
Young , let everything go its way ! "	-2.4543
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer rebellion in 1381 .	-9.9081
" There is a record of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 at the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.0280
" Farmers ' revolt began in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start .	-3.5207
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-2.3875
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit patron who hid the family Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.1713
Or ' The Smuggler ' , in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-3.7707
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : ' Messrs seemed to be pretty crooks , keep on debt and spend money on things they could not afford .	-5.3561
Other generations of Darrell men redeemed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them to be a bunch of well-looking boys , with a talent to advertise successors . "	-4.9839
After the end of his work at the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-3.8899
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki , the site of an early 20th century sanatorium , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-10.8901
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.6457
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.5212
It was like : " Oh , now I have to cope again with the damned life . "	-3.4869
Campaign started : Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf enveloped .	-3.2066
With the contraception of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the town of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .	-4.8395
Until Thursday mayors Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Artz the logo and the slogan secret .	-3.1686
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-4.1434
" Too beautiful for us .	-2.0042
Or ? " , ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-4.7436
" We don 't really think this ( of course ! ) , " they write on their website , which was released yesterday .	-4.8144
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.8457
And to make it clear that some is better than it seems .	-2.1897
Basically , we firmly believe that we , as Bad Honnefer , know citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . "	-7.7656
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it means more .	-4.8198
" It is necessary to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistakable unique feature " .	-6.2712
After all , it is competing with other municipalities .	-6.5607
The city of Bad Honnef can claim a mid-five-digit amount of its new roof brand and campaign costs .	-6.3380
Military reforms in Turkey – Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-2.3605
Each year in early August Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) on retirement and promotion in the officer corps .	-4.6591
This week , too .	-1.9238
At first glance a normal operation .	-2.0523
But nothing is routine in Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.5001
The meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .	-4.9198
The Heads of Government now also chaired the discussions with the five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and External Action .	-5.5914
This meant that civilians in the YAS were in excess .	-5.3083
The government attracts the reins in the military .	-2.9090
Although Hulusi Akar remains in office , the army ’ s commanders , the air forces , and the navy have been deposed . the , the , the , the , , the , the , the , , , the , the , the ,	-12.3375
Since the failed coup , Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.0020
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army ranks – mostly because of alleged connections to the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen ’ s movement , which Erdogan sees as the protector of the coup attempt .	-5.2463
Since this week , negotiations have been taking place in Ankara with 486 people directly involved in the coup attempt .	-5.3619
Even on the day after the coup , Erdogan described the coup attempt as a " godsend " because he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces .	-10.1803
But does Erdogan really manage the army ?	-2.5681
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unbehagen im Militär-Hauptquartier " .	-2.4294
In general terms , there are concerns about the increasing ' Islamisation ' of the army , which manifested itself , among other things , in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-6.3683
In any case , the army and the security forces continue to be the main target .	-7.5757
In mid-July , Erdogan ordered another 7395 civil servants , including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers , to be appointed by decree .	-4.4429
It seemed that Erdogan was taming the military .	-2.1437
The generals used to be the real masters of the country .	-2.2509
Three times , they invoked their role as guardians of the secular state order .	-3.0785
After his 2002 victory , Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reforms .	-4.5161
Former officers say that Erdogan is purposefully Islamizing the armed forces .	-3.8000
In the magazine ' Vocal Europe ' , a so-called officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned the Turkish army of ' full extremists and salafists ' in a few years ' time .	-5.2539
If that is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-4.3642
In any case , there are doubts in the alliance about the Turkish army 's readiness for action after the cleansing .	-5.3476
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are ' weakened ' , say NATO diplomats .	-2.7592
Washington Changes the Rules for the Green Card	-6.0780
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-7.2639
It provides for legal immigrants to be reduced to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family oriented visas .	-7.1356
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.7974
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.8947
" This law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way citizens are spent from other countries Green Cards . "	-3.5979
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.7797
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and to show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-4.1435
Ministry wants to sanate track for racetrack hut	-6.4599
Over the past few months , the future of the race track hut has been contested again and again - now it should be done very quickly .	-7.7545
Even before the end of the year the marods track on which the tourist track is going to be built is to be built .	-7.6592
In order to ensure the future of the racetrack hut in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , work is to start on the track this year .	-6.1743
" With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig , the country has committed itself to this important link , especially for tourism , " explained Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-5.7368
The cost of repairing the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million .	-2.9602
Of this sum , the country takes 75 percent .	-3.8205
The Treaty , on the basis of which the shuttle is also to be ordered from the country in future , is currently being finalised , Mr Sühl explained .	-8.9590
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operator agree on the technical details .	-4.2131
" This is the timetable , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated , " said Sühl .	-4.2812
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .	-9.7249
This means that the race shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 .	-5.4232
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular rail connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig .	-4.3924
Over the past few months , a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by enough people to re-order it regularly in future .	-6.0385
The track is also heavily built in parts .	-4.7383
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about doing so .	-2.5395
Just as you thought that 2017 could not be even more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .	-4.5229
Yes , indeed .	-0.9650
Sex-robots are now a big deal .	-2.5828
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.7074
According to Noel Sharkey , a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR , we must start to take their rise seriously .	-2.8332
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the breast wart and the type of fingernail .	-4.2953
" People make fun of them , but companies deliver lots of them , and we will see them much more often , " said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-5.3202
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberate human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-4.5808
The user can also customize his robot according to his beliefs , selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the chest warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-6.0539
But it becomes even more worrying , as many robots possess the " personalities " that would make a step-ford-woman look progressive .	-4.9727
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.7096
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics that they find appealing , such as shyness .	-5.3386
And then there is the Roxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shyness and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-4.4056
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible " , Swarming the site of True Companion .	-3.2237
So she likes what you like , and she does not like what you do not like , etc .	-5.9441
She also has her moods during the day - like real people !	-4.4115
You can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can be " in mood " !	-3.2936
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the subservient female properties , the allusions to rape when one goes on frigid ( that is , defiant ) Farrah , worries the most .	-6.8086
On his website compared True Companion Roxxxy with a Vibrator , but for men .	-2.1093
" If women ( sic ) can have a Vibrator , why can men then have no Roxxxxy ? " means it on the site .	-4.0435
However , these sex-robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-2.9409
Their emergence and growing sophistication point to a little darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subservience as an optional addition .	-8.6301
Most men , of course , will not hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes its rising popularity , they remain on the margins of consumer culture for the time being .	-4.8854
But what leaks from the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-4.5229
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-3.3852
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are appearing at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who has irradiated from attacking women sexually .	-5.4120
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the twisted bodies and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.8631
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-2.9553
The goal behind these sex-robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible ( though with porn star-proportions ) .	-4.5709
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body .	-3.0487
But , put on the point when it comes to their " personalities , " the robots are not real women .	-3.7420
You cannot separate from your pet or simply walk away .	-3.9222
They have no mediation or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the fantasy of total subjugation .	-4.1302
In other words , they are slaves .	-2.2177
Or , to put it bluntly , in 2017 : powers of service	-3.9995
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.3185
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense .	-1.6739
It has become a trump card in the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small format .	-4.1547
Around Christmas and Erntedankfest , there were advice in the US about how to deal with Trump ’ s horror .	-4.2530
We are all supposed to be bursting around our filter bubbles .	-3.5597
Less noticed is Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.4292
I mention this because my cousin , a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York .	-3.5240
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.6573
With Trump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Republican kinship with which she fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and uniquely on the same side .	-4.2608
This is certainly a good thing in terms of the table , but it strikes me in another context that it also entails considerable risks .	-6.1945
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the distorting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .	-3.4975
When we talk about ' normalisation ' and Trump , we are referring to the gruesome possibility that one day his guards will no longer bite us .	-5.6748
There is , however , an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump normalizes right-wing Republicans , who suddenly appear to be an embodiment of income compared to his standards .	-6.2227
I find myself today struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s comic version of the crazy – the dog on the car roof , who knew 14 % income tax ( but at least we saw his tax declaration ) – both of which seem very mild compared to Trump .	-6.2518
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.5362
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Central Park carousel , the largest carousel in New York ’ s park department , and the best three dollars spent in the city if you don ’ t need a cafe .	-4.7027
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarce and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely finster and the climate-permitting music conveys this in a strange way .	-5.8272
So many clichés of a city disappoint : The views of high buildings will be old , the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream .	-3.9035
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not , in fact , a Swiss cottage - the Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a major roundabout in northern London .	-5.3024
The Central Park carousel is still a strange experience , however , as here two two-year olds , one 11-year-olds and two women in the 40-year-olds can go to it and all have a great time .	-6.3907
If I had been able to assess the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it . .	-7.6343
On the other hand , this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-4.1941
In the coffeehouse on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the assessment with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the Ladin .	-5.8782
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to put personality in a situation where none is needed .	-4.8396
The poor woman in the department store apologized grinsend , while I weary the experience made her credit card with five stars to be .	-3.9842
Oscar Pistorius was transferred to hospital with breast aches from prison .	-3.8495
Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.4075
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts in his wrists , which , according to the prison authorities , he suffered in one case in his cell .	-4.8158
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against an initial death sentence .	-3.6814
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine ’ s Day in 2013 , several times by putting a door on the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria .	-4.7061
Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night intruder who hid in the cabin .	-3.6707
The prosecutors have announced their intention , this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , to appeal that they say they are too lenient .	-4.1718
The National Criminal Authorities said that they would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year .	-5.1802
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful .	-2.7073
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.9140
As a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg .	-2.6426
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the four clandestine pupils from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed into holidays and secondary schools .	-6.1223
Three of the students will go to the secondary school in the future , four to the real school .	-5.4761
Leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-3.3225
As a symbol of the school omission , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken house , but then is released into freedom .	-5.3439
In addition , the more mundane Schar conducted a musical entitled " Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf " .	-4.9575
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it break out of his chickens .	-3.4449
Instead of a chicken chicken , a small eagle came out .	-3.0807
But the hope of turning him a chicken crushed the eagle spread on a high mountain his wings and vanished .	-5.3965
After that , the classes showed three and four in the introduction of Yvonne Frank .	-4.8381
The hens danced with the young Gockeln , the cylinders carried around the bet .	-4.1998
The eagle stands for integration , said head of the School Angelika Sitte .	-7.6632
The kitten is different from the other kittens ( chicks ) , but they belong to it .	-4.9864
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.9207
His rule is to be free .	-2.6943
She wanted every four-legged student to feel at home in his new school .	-5.5991
Members of this House thanked former school leader Michael Müller , who always jumped in at school passports , and the parents ' representatives .	-6.9646
The chicken time is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.2332
They leave their students very reluctant after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .	-5.3713
In the end , they have been able to rely on the quarter-barrels .	-5.4888
At the end , all students had a song from summer time and holiday time .	-5.7436
It was a great pleasure for the children .	-4.2920
For the new school year eight first-class students are already registered .	-4.5341
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.3881
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .	-3.8887
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal people were arrested in Sithonia by the police , including the two Bulgarians .	-2.9852
On the same day , they were released , while an investigation is under way .	-3.3032
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that Bulgarians were released later .	-1.8622
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camps and are imposing substantial fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-5.7431
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.6143
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-8.2974
Software update for diesel vehicles : What those affected now need to know	-3.6576
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.8938
Should diesel drivers take part in the action ?	-3.0297
The most important questions and answers in the overview .	-1.9632
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.4925
They are intended to improve the performance of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-6.0946
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt .	-7.2444
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :	-2.6768
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.1515
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-2.1799
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have thrust software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.8432
Their retrofit has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration ( KBA ) .	-5.0803
How and from when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.2289
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet set a precise date .	-4.8361
Daimler has announced that it will write to each person concerned .	-4.1745
If an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within its framework .	-4.0814
How long will the changeover take ?	-4.2649
" Heavy to say , " says Smetanin .	-3.0166
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on the political pressure .	-3.6202
" Because we have seen voluntary action by car manufacturers on the environment so far not . "	-4.4679
How long should the update take ?	-2.1887
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.3702
It might be more time-consuming to get an appointment .	-3.2539
What do car drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group do ?	-3.1291
The ACE is waiting for you .	-3.4755
Presumably , foreign manufacturers would follow suit , Smetanin said .	-3.6956
Is there a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars ?	-3.0497
The ACE is afraid of that .	-3.4912
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten .	-4.2056
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.0226
The ACE advises to wait for a sale .	-3.6513
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award	-2.3595
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glamorous events in Washington .	-1.9268
The first prize-giving ceremony under President Trump promises to be political .	-2.3753
One of the laureates does not want to come - out of protest .	-2.1067
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .	-3.3149
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , there were also singers Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographers Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) .	-7.9222
The awards will be given at the beginning of December .	-2.7309
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and , together with his wife Melania , participate in the award .	-8.0706
The Lear award winner , who has become famous with progressive TV series , therefore announced that he would not participate in the gala .	-6.8334
The New York Times said : ' This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that is a burden on me ' .	-5.1492
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view .	-3.5159
The Kennedy Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-3.2201
The former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.2498
We Make the City Lifelong	-2.8210
Roland Wacker , Haslachs Stadtbaumeister , will be retiring next year .	-9.2659
The job is already advertised - suitable applicants are , however , rar .	-4.1148
Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city builder for 31 years .	-4.1521
And the work still gives him great fun , as he mediates in the press interview .	-5.2416
He reports varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor .	-3.5809
At the same time , he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile .	-3.5273
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the earliest opportunity .	-3.9264
The intention is that , while respecting the regular notice periods , there will still be enough time to prepare for them .	-7.6893
Since Haslach acts as a subcontracting authority for the administrative community , the applicant must present appropriate qualifications .	-4.8380
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case .	-3.5102
If they could no longer fill it , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-3.6438
But closeness to the citizens is important to the city and to itself , Wacker says , who reports of a good working climate and good mood between the authority and the citizens .	-7.0704
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , which Wacker looks back with pride .	-4.5441
" We make the city worth living " , he is sure about the construction office and its employees .	-5.0023
But there are also varied projects on the agenda in the future : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatze , for example , has been initiated .	-6.1876
The cinematic bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , and the stadium renovation is still the subject .	-8.3385
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million if we get it right .	-4.2051
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-3.5736
The work here is fun . "	-2.2898
There is plenty of room for a city builder to design .	-7.2670
With Haslach 's own Bauhof and Gärtnerei it can be reacted quite flexibly .	-4.6210
" You can move a lot , " says Wacker , and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-4.3601
Since the old town is listed as an ensemble , it is important to have an eye for what fits " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city builder stresses .	-6.5912
In any case , the mayor of the city bears a heavy responsibility .	-4.3769
He is a builder , " at the end everything goes over my table " .	-5.2240
He can count on many years of support and coordination : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( Tiefbau ) has been there for 15 years .	-5.7771
Even that his successor stays long , Wacker wishes : " We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and stay with the place " .	-5.2569
Continuity is important not only for a good business climate , but also for the further design of the city .	-3.7765
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker , you should be able to prove a completed degree in engineering or a Bachelor of Architecture after information from the city of Haslach and have a good knowledge of construction and planning law .	-8.5665
The Municipal Building Office is responsible for the construction , construction and civil engineering , land management , administration of the municipal properties , the Municipal Works Court with the Bauhof and the Municipal Gardens as well as the Lower Building Law Authority , including monument protection .	-10.8007
Cycling on circuits : South railway line locked .	-5.3997
According to the police , the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße ( B116 ) onto the lines .	-4.2940
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-4.1109
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-4.3299
Near the scene were observed by witnesses a rose-tinted scooter and a bicycle driver .	-4.8334
" This goes far beyond a whim bubble , " said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch on APA .	-4.0490
The perpetrators , or the perpetrators , would have endangered themselves in great danger , as well as rail transport .	-5.7297
In addition to the damage caused to the locomotive and the facility , as well as the delay and the cost of rail replacement traffic , pawns at the railway customers could also be provided for the perpetrators .	-9.5028
All in all , it is a ' substantial ' sum , said the speaker .	-5.3904
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , and rail transport on the southern railway line could be operated without disabilities .	-6.3138
Nearly ten passenger trains left Friday morning , two of which affected long-distance transport .	-5.4308
Freight trains did not fall , but they were delayed .	-2.5949
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .	-3.0995
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.5812
Red meat , milk products , and chocolate could help to relieve IBD ( inflammatory disease ) .	-3.3740
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.3504
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in carbon-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease .	-3.7636
The incurable state of affairs that affects the US , at around 1.3 million , and 300,000 in the UK , causes stomach contractions and vesicles , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-5.2658
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote tolerant intestines .	-4.9472
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that intestinal immune cells patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .	-4.2776
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-8.0997
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory disease .	-4.3491
In experiments , it was found that a form of tolerance occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines .	-6.2439
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-3.1375
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a bacteria species - lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.4811
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . "	-3.1650
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in Tryptophan promote more tolerant , less inflammatory intestines when the same system also affects humans .	-5.4023
The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of mafias had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had been separated , but that had not .	-11.1534
She suspected that the difference with the intestinal problems of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses , and fungi , which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-9.4331
The mice ’ s demons were sequenced to DNA , and six types of bacteria found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them in mice .	-5.1975
Moravians were raised in a sterile environment , so they lacked an intestinal robiom and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells .	-5.9625
To understand how the bacteria had an impact on the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to immunological cells isolated by the mice .	-5.5587
The immune cells developed into tolerant supporting cells .	-2.8852
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid .	-3.6430
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in mice ’ s feed , the number of such cells rose by about 50 % , but when the Tryptophane values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.1896
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant supporting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri in our stomach tracts protect .	-8.8889
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-4.9633
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-7.7470
Potentially , high tryptophane values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri . "	-4.3528
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-2.6448
At Manchester United , Nemanja Matic signed a genius , Jose Mourinho believes , after midfielder Mittwochabend had his debut against Sampdoria .	-8.0000
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holding role , as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched to popularity .	-4.5001
Matic , however , had been excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which allowed Mourinho to improve League season before the premiere .	-11.0085
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-2.1870
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-2.1853
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also stared in the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season .	-4.3475
This week , the Independent revealed that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to meet three of its four priority commitments .	-5.1329
" Three of four to get , for which I thank the association , " he added .	-3.0561
" I 'll be happier if they get for me four of four , but they have taken great trouble . "	-3.4288
Boeing " malt " Dreamliner in the sky sky	-1.7289
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky .	-2.5087
The pilots fled from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner about the U.S. , which are several thousand kilometers .	-5.0457
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.6133
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner to be .	-3.1879
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.6427
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .	-2.8704
Thus the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .	-3.4614
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem	-3.8725
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , socialist prime ministers in the run-up to elections always looked after Berlin with some concern .	-5.7772
Bloß did not disturb the central party party , just not a counterwind from the federal government - that was the main wish of the campaign fighters .	-8.8946
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.8795
Since then , the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD governed provincial capitals with growing horror .	-5.7450
What Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in terms of headwinds . .	-8.8880
It was rock-bottom .	-3.9298
One after the other .	-1.9632
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens .	-4.1864
" This shows once again : Rot-Grün cannot simply govern reliably , " said CDU-Secretary-General Peter Tauber the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.5056
The surprising party leader of a Green MEP toppled Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .	-4.5501
Five months before the country elections , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-3.0261
The German founder Michael Kellner invited the dissident Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to give back her mandate .	-6.0287
The transition to the CDU is a clear distortion of the electorate .	-3.3671
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate , " said the German Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.8128
" All this must not be true , " a SPD campaigner joins forces when , on Friday morning , the new Hiobsbotschaft reaches the party headquarters .	-7.2534
Stephan Weil , SPD ’ s prime minister of Lower Saxony , is named after the transfer of the Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU without his own government majority .	-5.3972
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD national associations .	-7.5602
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.9079
The plight began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-3.4080
A blue eye , no longer , the comrades reassured at the time .	-3.3155
After the general elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.7806
That became clear - and it was all much worse .	-5.4082
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the pigeon , the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party smooth .	-4.1591
Hardly enough , the comrades returned in the weeks thereafter .	-6.7907
Then , when they just had new courage , the G20 summit in Hamburg came .	-4.0544
And with him came the next deep strike .	-3.3240
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost to that weekend his nimbus because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-3.6111
And because he did it quite wrong in crisis communication after that , what can be done wrong .	-5.8240
Since then , Scholz has struggled for his political survival .	-1.9390
Now , then , Stephan Weil . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-6.0488
Due to the VW Abgasaffäre and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been under criticism for some time .	-6.4541
Miese Umfragewerte added .	-1.7491
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because in recent weeks has been increasingly trying to set accents in the federal government .	-6.7412
The ambition of Hanover ’ s former mayor to expand his power in Berlin was not concealed by Martin Schulz ’ s comrades .	-9.1027
They allowed him to , because they promised to stabilize the party .	-4.3585
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.4674
It is because the internal dispute of the Lower Saxony Greens is basically not to blame .	-5.5225
And Schulz has not .	-2.9381
For the time being , the comrades are trying to keep their own .	-3.1604
Her anger is directed at the Greens , and especially at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten .	-4.2259
" It is unbearable and democratic , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of all others , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the left-wing party in the SPD Bundestagsfraktion , the editorial network Deutschland ( RND ) .	-5.0103
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but because of the country list of Lower Saxony Greens , so the Lower Saxon Member goes on .	-6.6708
The logical consequence would be that it should return its mandate .	-3.0717
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestagsfraktion , laments an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.5857
" The electorate was clear four years ago : People have Stephan Weil as prime minister , " says Oppermann , who runs the Lower Saxon SPD as the top candidate in the federal election , the RND .	-5.3368
" Now the personal career memory of a future CDU member falsifies the election result , " said Oppermann .	-3.6742
He called for clarification of the background .	-2.7242
I want to know whether there has been more or more commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-3.3763
Funding for Ortskern III	-3.1587
Anyone who wants to renovate his house , which has been bought for years , will soon be able to receive support from the country .	-6.0804
In addition , Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG Stadtentwicklung informed on Wednesday in Empfingen .	-9.1319
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a retrospective of what has happened so far .	-4.2946
Since 1991 there have been recovery areas in Empfingen .	-3.3184
At that time , in the Sanierungsgebiet I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg still took over two thirds of the amount of funding .	-5.0156
In the rehabilitation zone II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-4.1319
For Schindler , the previous refurbishments are a " success project " - unless it is ultimately important to promote the development of the interior as well , and not only to open up new construction areas .	-6.4619
On 4 April , the Government Bureau of Karlsruhe informed us that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-5.4143
The grant amount was EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest from the municipality of Empfingen .	-3.7297
How is a rehabilitation area created ?	-4.0985
They will continue to study , according to Schindler , where the " really old " houses are .	-4.5369
However , it also plays a role in whether there is any interest whatsoever in the area planned .	-5.2799
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be postponed again .	-4.6046
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-2.0930
Keller presented the contents of the federal program " Social City " , in which frameworks would then be performed .	-4.5078
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .	-4.3835
The measures would be carried out objectively , that is , on a per plot basis .	-9.4326
Finally , the rehabilitation area would be set as a statute .	-3.9293
The grant period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-3.8742
By September of this year , however , stocktaking would be carried out only once , in which those involved in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire .	-7.2774
In November or December , the decision on saturation should be taken as far as possible , so that remediations can begin next year .	-6.0818
Pietzschmann then declared that every municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .	-3.9890
It is a matter of assessing and deciding when and to what extent urban planning is being remedied .	-7.2739
It will then also be entered in the land registry for the land in question .	-6.5707
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and make a picture of the situation , promised it .	-5.5377
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .	-4.5276
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-4.6955
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and plot sheet " , which deals , among other things , with the construction condition and the restructuring intentions .	-5.8364
In the grey questionnaire , the budget and housing sheet , information on the size , distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be made .	-5.1934
The blue " Arc of operation " can only be filled if the premises are operated .	-5.7871
It should be noted , however , that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .	-8.5843
In addition , new construction measures are not eligible .	-4.1537
Schindler emphasized that the distribution of subsidies according to the " greyhound principle " works - who comes first , exhorts first .	-4.9098
You cannot reserve any subsidy money for later " .	-4.7387
At the end , photos of the project " Ortskern II " were shown in order to make the attendees a rehabilitation " tasty " .	-5.9860
British inventor himself uses a microchip to get into house and car with a hand movement .	-5.7517
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start with a hand movement his car .	-4.2331
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and index fingers and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by its company BioTeq .	-3.7198
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .	-4.1948
The technology resembles a cats and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-3.0268
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .	-3.5908
The married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .	-4.0838
The advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars .	-7.7192
The decision of the White House to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlighted American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers according to military data left to the TIME magazine , up to $ 24,000 .	-14.8834
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American building programs .	-3.8612
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states .	-2.5506
The helicopter , manufactured in Connecticut , was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine , a Wisconsin fire-fighter and a Mississippi forklift truck .	-8.2626
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-3.4166
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his supervisor , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-9.0930
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on 17 July , at 7 a.m. , and that until the pitch was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-11.2888
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight .	-4.2040
The original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event , while the security staff remained on the ground during the flight .	-5.7841
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .	-4.1374
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.0897
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could infringe the provision .	-3.7121
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-3.3582
" Blades as if you are locked , " replied the Deputy Commander .	-3.1714
The event " Made in America " was called the official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.8187
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.5952
At the event , the president initiated health-care reform reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations .	-5.3363
The use of the aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes .	-3.3323
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-1.6345
But to request their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-3.7119
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft , against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxidienste , and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about the use of the president ’ s aircraft by his predecessors . , the of .	-15.3077
" The White House is thrilled by the show " Made In America " - the products from all 50 states shows produced by American workers using American materials , " said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-3.8107
HMX 1 crews often conduct training flights around Washington and the South Lawn to estimate the US president in the White House with precise centimetres .	-5.2973
When Trump was in Germany at the G-20 summit in early July , HMX-1 landed 58 exercises in the White House .	-3.4936
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-3.6831
Helicopter units additionally flown 11 hours on this day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-4.0078
The White House said that taxpayers were not shouldering the burden for any of the other Requisitions presented at the event .	-7.9930
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in suspending the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-3.2017
HMX-1 does not have budget records for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-4.3524
According to hourly rates by the US Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $ 24.380 per hour .	-5.1113
Recordings of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.7705
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate .	-2.6255
" The cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.2054
" These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . "	-2.9690
According to a 2015 RAND study , the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance , and contract closure .	-4.4597
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the helicopter ’ s deployment for the event .	-3.3728
" The idea is to present this week things made in America , " said Spicer .	-2.3926
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , of people are dependent on it .	-5.3453
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.6322
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.9310
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he viewed his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he sat in the driver ’ s seat of a firefighter .	-5.1350
In the White House , Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of business products .	-2.8652
" I know Sikorsky very well , " said the president , " I have three of them . "	-2.1482

How America Can hurt OMV	-6.4984
Indeed , Donald Trump was not happy when he signed Trump ’ s centenary bill to tighten sanctions on Russia .	-5.7534
" In his hatred to enact the law , " the Congress passed a few " unconstitutional regulations " , he estimated .	-4.0372
The Moscow response , too , was as harsh as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of US efforts .	-4.8890
After all , the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.4431
Since then , investors from OMV , which co-finances Nord Stream 2 with other European companies , have been worried about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea ice .	-5.0195

Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be put at the centre of the series of hits by Netflix .	-4.4802
Despite the second season of Narcos , which Pablo Escobars Killer reveals , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-2.9320
The relays three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show .	-2.9691
With the third season , DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cali-Kartell .	-3.7635
Led by four powerful sponsors , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more state bribes and violent actions .	-3.1819

Role backwards : The city provides 46 kitchen aids a one	-8.1355
The town organizes the Kita lunch trip itself .	-3.6714
With strong contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .	-4.1067
The clock is turned back in the municipal nurseries .	-4.5029
On September 1 , the town of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the municipal children 's facilities ( Kitas ) again in its own hands .	-6.4009
For Sonja Pommeranz , deputy director in the field of youth aid , this is good news : " We were all very pleased " . and .	-5.2186
Gekocht will continue to be outside the house : a caterer takes over this task and supplies fresh cooked food .	-6.9924
The town operates 46 day-care centres in Krefeld , where 44 children get a warm meal for lunch .	-5.4648
In the last kitajahr there were 2800 children sitting at the tables each and the demand is growing steadily .	-5.9575
" Meanwhile , not only children , who are cared for 45 hours a week , eat in the Kita at noon " , explains Pommeranz .	-5.4957
" The offer is also valid in the 35-hour service if children stay until 14 o 'clock " .	-4.3570
46 part-time workers have the kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the food supplied , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , port the meal individually , give the food , clean it , wash it and clean the kitchen .	-8.0838
" The employees are assigned to a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-3.2587
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the hourly range .	-5.0028
" The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team , " says Pommeranz satisfied .	-3.9224
" So they are much more involved and it is easier for kitesurfing to implement pedagogical concepts " .	-3.7279
This is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-3.9451
" Children should help to prepare food " .	-3.1387
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.0611
For children too .	-2.5234
" They have a known force in the kita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people " .	-3.3967
This continuity is important for children .	-1.5320
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - previously also the job of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .	-5.6926
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has the charm , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen service , that it has proved to be the most economical in terms of cost comparisons between own government and foreign procurement for the city , i.e. from the press .	-9.8163
And that , though 46 part-time workers will be reset .	-3.4523
" But these hours do not carry so much weight with about 750 people in the educational field , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-5.3398

Men are trying to kill 13-year-old girls	-6.7240
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to deprive a 13-year-old girl .	-2.9475
According to information from the police , the men spoke to the 13-year-old , who kept up with friends at the Kolping Street , at 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to telephone the girl 's mobile phone .	-6.4638

GMB concerns about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-3.1047
A trade union wants to reassure McVitie , the Biskuit manufacturer , about the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant .	-6.0948
GMB Scotland said the company has weighed over the future of investments at Tollcross-site .	-3.1447
More than 500 employees work at the plant , which besides other products produces hobbies and Rich Tea biscuits .	-3.9155
McVity ’ s owner , Pladis , said that he has invested more than £ 5 million in recent years .	-3.0972
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be " experienced first " if their activities changed .	-3.7898
In a letter to the company 's chief executive , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called for " expressing concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward " .	-5.8797
GMB-Senior-Organisator Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we can not gain clarity from the General-Site-Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply .	-4.1404
Generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is focusing heavily on the local community and the Glasgow area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation .	-4.8332
Thus , from the perspective of jobs , wages , and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , rising cost of living , and chronic decline in output , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing McVitie production presence . "	-6.1149
A spokesperson for Pladis said : " The head of the subsidiary at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this , as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-6.2693
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-3.3091
We discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate , are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-5.9540
She added : " In recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in our Tollcross-site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-4.1450
We recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site and we fully acknowledge that if our operations change at the site , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this . "	-7.4783

The side of La Liga likes its interest in Marco Verratti regret	-3.0859
Paris Saint-Germain will not drop in her pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did she warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record outbreak ?	-6.4957
The sensational approach fueled the summer transfer window , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pogba returning for £ 89 million to Manchester United last season .	-4.1877
After the end , Neymar will become the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest-paid professional athlete . PSG wages of more than GBP a week . .	-11.3390
Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out , although a source near the catalan stock insists that the club has always given its best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-5.6339
But was the football world warned about this prospect three years ago by the PSG president ?	-2.6049
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG 's best players .	-3.4815
" I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.6041
" We respect all clubs .	-0.8469
But if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . "	-3.2034
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti .	-3.8356
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar .	-4.4247
Rollers thrown and damaged	-2.3383
In the night of Friday on Saturday an unknown dancer posted a roller in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the estate number 30 he deliberately thrown away and thus caused damage to the lining of the vehicle over 200 euros .	-8.0920

In an accident at the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese , the police are looking for witnesses . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-8.5925
Because a car came up against him on his chassis , the driver had to depart from a VW tour and touched the circuit board .	-8.1084
On Thursday evening , the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on the B 215 from Stolzenau with his VW at 7.55 p.m. , heading towards Leese .	-5.4700
In the area surrounding Stolzenau , a passenger car came to him on his track , so he had to turn right .	-6.8540
At the same time , the tour driver touched the circuit board .	-6.2019
The car was damaged .	-4.1672
The driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without bothering the traffic accident .	-4.3403
According to the accident data , it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not even noticed the accident .	-4.7226
The police are now asking witnesses to the incident , as well as the driver of the polluter 's vehicle , to contact the commissioner in Stolzenau at Tel 05761 / 92060 .	-5.6253
Interview : " Domspatzen-Bericht entlastet Papst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger "	-1.5888
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on abusive cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger .	-3.5142
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-6.6264
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussion .	-3.6884
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the Reformmovement " We are Church " , declared after publication to the German Press Agency , he expects from the former Regensburger Bischof and today 's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the Cathedral kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI , an apology .	-5.8084
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or misjudgement of what happened at the time .	-9.4360
The Vatican Chancellery " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticized the fact that , in reporting on violence , double standards are applied to the domains .	-6.6568
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is ' shameful and shameful deeds ' that should be punished and prevented in future ; but it is conspicuous by the ' degree of media manipulation ' , according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian Bioethics Committee .	-5.9585
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal " , writes Scaraffia .	-4.5603
In an interview with the Bavarian radio station Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said : " You are happy to go to the church and this is a fancy " .	-7.7037
In addition , she pointed out that in her youth " beatings were a very normal pedagogical means " to deal with cheeky children , as I was , " .	-6.3567
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-3.1768
In connection with the reports on abuse cases , it is often the case that Pope brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared .	-5.6505
Unjustifiably , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the reminder book " My Brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-5.3574
" I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he evaluates the results of the final report .	-3.2450
What exactly does the 440 page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , charged with enlightenment by the Bistum Regensburg ?	-4.2386
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen have been sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 Domspatzen .	-5.1415
In the final report , Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , says : " In summary , it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. used physical and psychological violence in many cases .	-5.7073
Especially with high emotionality the punishment for the students could be even more severe .	-5.4895
Despite this , in contrast to many other defendants , it is striking that many victims value the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence . '	-11.3761
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves his opinion .	-3.2222
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the ' incidents of the use of force in protective foals at the Regensburger Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of the cathedral captain Georg Ratzinger .	-6.1804
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity " .	-3.3920
On the other hand , he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist , who became more effective when a dome vocals did not produce a top performance .	-7.7396
How do you view this final report as his biographer ?	-2.9340
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble to read the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why Georg Ratzinger 's name comes in .	-5.9280
He is currently on eight pages , and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-5.2857
The texzesse violence at the preschool also took place outside its sphere of influence .	-4.6460
At best , he can be accused of being too late or of not taking the first suggestions seriously enough .	-5.7360
The Domspatzengymnasium , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-4.9027
Thus , the vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , presents an excellent testimony , describing it as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " sympathetic " , as extremely benign teachers , who regularly mailed the boys with cakes , biscuits and bonbonbons and " always surrounded by grapes of children " .	-12.8741
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which also led to anger .	-4.2766
The fact that he not only threw the keyring on the ground with his stools , but also spread earlobes and pulled too cheeky boys to his hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologized for it .	-9.6359
But his salvation must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the time in question , the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , with parents like teachers .	-5.3001
Do you know any of these breeding methods ?	-4.2385
Of course , I think each of us born before 1968 .	-2.3175
I , too , have experienced this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-4.1945
Compared with what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence at the preschool , these are , of course , trivial .	-6.4036
One wonders whether it has more to do with his popularity and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed to him .	-6.8517
Many of the Bavarian pope who never understood him are still eager to work .	-5.1005
However , the truth is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-7.1092
In the media a lot has been reported in connection with the report on the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-5.1167
Will Georg Ratzinger report any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse ?	-3.3944
Michael Hesemann : No .	-2.1782
Not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Cathedral kapellmeister .	-3.9747
Not even the parents were consecrated .	-2.7569
" I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it , " said one of the victims on behalf of the others , " It was all very embarrassing to me . "	-5.5343
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was , and still is , that most of the victims are silent .	-5.7127
If they did not even trust parents and siblings , certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators on a professional basis .	-5.7133
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger ’ s role with regard to abuse cases ?	-9.7439
Michael Hesemann : As one questioned student put it , " With regard to sexual abuse ... I do not see a case in which it would have had ( Georg Ratzinger ) timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-6.8065
I also think it really absurd to assume that he , of all things , has been more inclined to penetrate or clarify , or rather have opened up , than to her parents , boarding schools , trusted teachers , etc .	-10.4383
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . "	-2.4484
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that he was able to trust pupils and / or their environment in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation ' .	-7.4596
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is entitled to be released from any fellowship .	-4.3630
He cannot be accused of not preventing or displaying him .	-4.9780
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases .	-7.0265
In the media there was much to read of " violent texzessen " at the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-4.2544
Georg Ratzinger , the former cathedral captain , is accused in the report of ' looking the way ' .	-7.7311
Must he live with this charge ?	-2.3676
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed up and mixed up in the coverage , into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.7917
But that , in turn , is an abuse of the report .	-3.1112
After all , it is neatly separated : between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Cathedral treasures , between sexual abuse and violence , and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.7598
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral conductor of the Cathedral Treasures .	-5.8211
All the terrible caning pedagogy , the cases in which boys were harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly , all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed .	-6.9957
But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the domspatzengymnasium .	-9.6250
On that , as most witnesses emphasize , was the subject " preschool " taboo .	-3.9947
One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " states .	-3.8915
What was different about the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-2.7826
Michael Hesemann : There was already discipline , but there was no sadistic violence .	-7.9241
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , who concludes that " many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even combine positive memories with him " .	-5.8459
At most that remains the charge of looking away .	-5.3164
But , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported of the conditions at the pre-school .	-8.4403
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not actually and responsibly , ( according to the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and only then again around 1993 .	-7.8774
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently keep his ears shut before the conditions ?	-4.6625
Michael Hesemann : No , because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , who even reproduces the report .	-3.3209
In this he points out that ' the practice of caning continues in the pre-school ' .	-5.3737
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . . , , . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.6876
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when caning was banned in Bavaria long ago .	-4.4282
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as we all know .	-4.1035
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the limit was really exceeded .	-5.4514
However , one cannot say that he has always looked the other way .	-3.8942
That is simply not true .	-1.2857
It was not until 1980 that caning in schools in Bavaria was officially abolished .	-3.0150
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today 's pedagogical standards to the time . , , and .	-5.2270
How do you see this ?	-1.8137
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " Fallstrick of anachronism " , that is , the danger of assessing it by moral standards today .	-4.1219
The prince is right there .	-3.2187
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abominable at all times and which does not apply to what happened at the pre-school level in the event of opposition and violence against innocent children ’ s souls , which goes far beyond what was then the practice .	-8.3115
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked on .	-4.4573
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.2268
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is , cowardly hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-4.7417
As a physical punishment was then banned , he has also strictly adhered to it .	-4.6212
What image of his Regensburg era did Georg Ratzinger give in the talks with you for the book " My Brother of the Pope " ?	-4.7981
Is the subject of caning also on the agenda ?	-4.8735
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict XVI , telling from his perspective , because the Cathedral Treasures played only a minor role .	-5.6484
Nevertheless , I do not deny that he led a strict regime there .	-5.0380
But this must also be said once : without this perfectionism , without the demand of absolute discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution from the national known Regensburger Domspatzen until then , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-6.8815
With biscuits and bonbons alone , you don ’ t even make big singers out of recalcitrant boys , and before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-8.1679
What kind of people did you experience with Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book ?	-5.1605
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and always again as a wonderful , humorous , basic , deep believing and hearty good people , from whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything other than a fly .	-7.8632
I regularly get in touch with him , as many former Domspatzen still today , 23 years after his Emeritation , to keep him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .	-5.9882
Those who still do not forgive him that he was even too strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-5.1673
Most of the Cathedral treasures are grateful to him today for enriching his life and bringing the world of music closer to them .	-4.5386
And that he was always a good , fatherly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovable respect man , to whom they are still watching today and who worship them .	-8.2519
Once again , I would like to make it quite clear that everything that he is accused of is educational methods that were then on the agenda .	-6.8840
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this period .	-3.9122
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make media scapegoat .	-7.6934
That is the bad intention behind it , all too obvious .	-4.5109
Because the report that has just been published relieves him .	-2.9579
Now the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and who would probably not know the Regensburg Cathedral treasures outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany would finally be allowed to live in peace .	-8.2771
