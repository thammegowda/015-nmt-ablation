Deleted in France ’ s Chemical Plant
The fire in a chemical plant in the northern French town of Rouen, which was reported by the Normandy prefecture on Friday, had broken out overnight on Thursday, and no one was injured in the incident with around 200 fire vehicles.
Stop the Fire
The factory is part of the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU Seveso Directive, which lays down particularly stringent safety requirements.
The plant employs about 400 people, and the chemical factory has already made headlines in the past – for example, when a leak of gas leaked methanol in 2013 and the surrounding area roamed for rotten eggs.

Losses in the German Army: Machine guns vanish.
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In the past few years, the Bundeswehr has lost many weapons and tens of thousands of shot ammunition, including three machine guns.
In the United States, the United States and the United States have signed an agreement with the United States on the acquisition of arms and ammunition in the United States.
According to the paper from the office of Under-Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon section and 3474 shot munitions have resurfaced so far.
Renner, a member of the United Nations Security Council, said: "The United Nations Security Council should not be held responsible for the conduct of the UN Security Council.
Stena Impero Oil Tanks Left Iranian Port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas this Friday, in the of in the United Arab.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian Government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters for the time being.
The "Stena Impero" was found on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on charges of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker in the UK's Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important maritime routes in the world, linking the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean, and much of the global oil exports are being shipped through the straits, and tensions in the region have intensified enormously in recent months, with merchant shipping having been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran, leading to several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates People ’ s Courage in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago in the Peaceful Revolution; in the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens would have shaken the former GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony held by the German CDU Group in Thuringia on the forthcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt.
Musk aspires to a record in extradition
Tesla Quartal may hold a record, but despite a boom in deliveries, there have been losses in the electric car group.
"We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla staff published by the industry blog "Electrek".
It is said that Musk ’ s circulars continued to drive the cars to customers quickly, so Tesla had to raise as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla ’ s shares went out of business with a growth of more than six percent, which has not increased for nearly four months.
Musk needs a record to reach its high targets, with a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars in 2019, and a six-figure figure figure figure figure for the current and coming quarter.
Solving the puzzle: that is why we cannot tickle ourselves.
A kind of brake on the brain prevents people from kitting themselves, as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin have discovered with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening, and progress has been made on the question of why children are so fiercely opposed to tickling, only to demand more.
After all, it has become clear why approaching a tickling hand triggers laughter even before touching.
According to earlier research, rats with "laughter" in ultrasound respond when they are peddled by humans; this "laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter oppressed During Self-Touch
It is assumed that the brain can distinguish between touch and touch by others - that is, that people cannot tickle themselves - but the Berlin researchers found in experiments on rats that the laughter and activity of the area in question of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-touch, even when living creatures clean themselves.
It is not a matter of time, but it is a matter of time and time.
It is also the case that some of the most famous figures in the history of the game have been found in the United States.
The French Chemical Company ’ s Delt of Catastrophe

Factory is part of the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces lubricants and is part of the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU's so-called Seveso directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past – for example, when a leak leaked the gas methanol in 2013 and the surrounding area roamed for rotten eggs. In 2015, after an industrial accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city ’ s sewage system.
Brexit: Blaming Johnson from Own Sister
The prime minister ’ s sister commented on Boris Johnson ’ s speech at Parliament ’ s first meeting after the forced break was lifted on Wednesday evening, with the prime minister threatening to lead the country on October 31 without an EU agreement if Brussels does not agree to its demands for changes to the Brexit agreement.
Through Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the prime minister said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and reunite that country would be to leave the EU," and Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Revelations of Oslo and Utoya
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya, with 77 dead, a memorial to the victims is unveiled in Norway on Saturday.
In the same place the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims.
On 22 July 2011, the legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first set up a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp in the youth organisation of the Social Democratic Workers ’ Party on the island of Utöya.
Iran Free British Tankers
The general debate in the United Nations did not resolve the Iran conflict, but now there is less of a problem: the British oil tanker Stena Impero, which was held in Iran, could go to sea again, and could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Rouhani ’ s peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters.
In the wake of the incident, the Australian government announced that it had agreed to withdraw from the contract.
In London, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was illegal to set up the ship, 'this is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law,' said a communication on Friday.
On 19 July, Iran ’ s Revolutionary Guards charged the tanker with failing to comply with maritime law regulations in the Persian Gulf, and seven of the 23 members of the crew had already been released at the beginning of September, while the remaining 16 crew members were,,,,,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The British Government, behind the establishment of the 'Stena Impero', suspected a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar in the UK: a supertanker with oil from Iran, which is alleged to have been destined for Syria, had been ordered in early July by the authorities against EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria, and the US had notified the British of the ship.
The Iranian people spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences; in mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released, and suspicions that it was a bargaining chip to free the "Stena Impero" were vehemently rejected by London.
The Strait of Hormus is one of the most important maritime routes in the world, linking the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean, and much of the world ’ s oil exports are being shipped through the straits, and tensions in the region have intensified enormously in recent months, with merchant shipping having been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran, with several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington lies the nuclear dispute between both countries, which the US accuses Iran ’ s leaders of wanting to build nuclear weapons, which Iran rejects in 2018, when the US unilaterally withdrew from the international nuclear deal, which was supposed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on Iran ’ s leaders to implement massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a tougher and wider agreement.
Due to the dispute over the Stena Impero and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant vessels in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
India has a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
With the punitive tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People ’ s Republic are being forced to re-distribute, with Asian financial leaders considering moving their production from China to another country calling India one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey, though not only because of the vagaries of the Sino-American trade war; with a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems poised to play a more prominent role in the largely ramified production chain.
But now India itself has fallen into Trump ’ s focus. From the White House budget, pejorative as the “Kingdom of Tariffs, ” America removed trade preferences from the emerging world for 2,000 products in early June, with the US accusing India of prohibitively high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, however, friction with India is merely a side show, and America views the world ’ s largest democracy through the security lens as well. Delhi and Washington combine concern about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean, so a salvo of America ’ s punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely, so India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just assumed a second five-year term, is likely to be lulled into doubt.
The problem, however, lies elsewhere: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development is a difficult one in the Socialist Republic of India, even under Modi, whose zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long; firms now receive rapid building permits; they benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure; and a more effective bankruptcy and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for liquidating fake firms with high debt.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic in India in the first five, in in trade, in in in in in in in the in the in the in. in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in
In the West, Modi depends on the nimbus of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country economically, owing not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At its core, the India First Advocate has never relied on protectionist economic policies, preventing Indian firms from being forced to get rid of anachronistic practices and become fit for global competition. Business people who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries belong to the tribal constituencies of Modi ’ s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, and who lament this shortsighted policy.
Appointment of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
According to a report by former French President Jacques Chirac, the former head of state will be buried in the cemetery of Montparnasse in the south of the French capital on Monday, the AFP news agency, citing Chirac ’ s family, reported that the funeral would take place in a close family circle.
Aiming its competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships.
In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to swing dangerously, and was barely able to keep on his legs for about 300 meters before the finish, running in an unhealthy position when Braima Suncar from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly knocked him down and slowly dragged him into the final half of the stadium.
"I just wanted to help him, everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he caught the attention of the assembled journalists completely unexpectedly, he switched off, didn't want to talk at all about his heroism, because he wanted to put up his personal best time and realized that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only one member of his body, and anyway he would only be proud to represent his country invited by the World Federation for the World Cup, which is why I am proud to run here for my country, "he said.

Millions: Egyptians Prepare for Wild Protest Day
In September 2008, the government announced that it will continue to pursue a policy of strengthening the government ’ s security measures in Egypt in the run-up to possible anti-government protests.
In the last few days, the police had stepped up checks on the roads, and some pedestrian cell phones had been searched for news and photos in connection with the protests, and hundreds protests.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, accused of corruption and mismanagement by critics, who have not had such open protests against the political leadership in Egypt for years; the Egyptian developer and actor Mohammed Ali, exiled in Spain, who launched the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for today's Friday to be a "multi-million march" in central places in the country; Ali calls for a "People's Revolution"; for most young Egyptians, he is not a "good man, because he has been a subcontractor to the army, he has sent millions of messages, but his arrival.
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) recorded more than 1,570 arrests until Friday, with the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) reporting that more than 2,000 arrests had been made, and the government.
Arbitrary arrests
According to their lawyers, the charges against the detainees range from "spreading false information" to membership of a "terrorist association".
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, so the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: It is easier for retailers to donate returns.
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost, and around 20 million returns are dumped, but there is an alternative.
The Treasury has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products, rather than destroy them.
While companies could not be exempted from the value-added tax on material donations, the ministry raised a question from the Green Bundestag faction, which was reported in the Funke Media Group ’ s newspapers on Friday, and traders could set the market value of unsold returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little sales tax. sales sales sales sales, sales sales, sales, sales, sales,,

Banksy art at auction: there was never a better time to sell this painting.
The well-known work of Streetart star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned off.
For Branczyk, Banksys's work "underscores the transformation of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into a state of animal and tribes.From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is auctioned on October 3, and is estimated at between 1.5 and 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol, in the south-west of Britain, where Banksy lives; this year, the artist re-exhibited the painting, coinciding with the original Brexit date on March 29, when the work, formerly called Question Time, was renamed Devolved Parliament.
The image could change owner for a million.
On Wednesday, at the first meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had recently exchanged strong blows with the opposition at the Supreme Court ’ s first meeting of the House of Commons after Johnson ’ s forced break.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate; in Dover, in the south-east of England, he painted a picture of a man breaking a European flag star with a bullet, with thousands of truck drivers and other visitors watching every day on his way to the United Kingdom.
Brexit Debate Is Like a Park Walk
The intense verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not, according to his top adviser, contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, the current controversy is a “walk in the park, ” said Dominic Cummings on Friday in a book presentation.
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days, accusing them, among other things, of "treason" against the people, accusing them of endangering MPs for being targeted by death threats, for example, he dismissed as "humbug.",,.,,, and,.,, and,,,,,,,,
Cummings said that the only way to restore calm is if MEPs finally respected Britain ’ s decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people are upset that Britain has still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
On Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint in the face of the atmosphere being invited. 'We should talk to each other with respect', a statement said. '' '.' '' ''. '' '' '
Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno Intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister, Imran Khan, on his first appearance before the United Nations General Assembly, called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India would be likely, said Khan on Friday at the United Nations General Debate in New York: 'If things go badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst'; the United Nations would have had a responsibility for Kashmir: 'You should have avoided that'.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of which have been fought over the divided Kashmir region, both of which command part of Kashmir and part of China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn autonomy from the Indian Kashmir region, thereby dramatically increasing tensions relative to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo are demanding the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government ’ s response to today ’ s protests in Egypt is tough: it is firing live ammunition, more than 2,000 detainees are joining in prison for the 60,000 political prisoners already in the country. Protests have never been safe in Egypt. But, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything it can to avoid a scenario like that of the Arab Spring..,, and.,, and,.,, and.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation, with poverty, hopelessness, and the sense of being stifled by one ’ s own government driving millions to the streets, a problem that the al-Sisi regime, no matter how hard it is to deal with adversaries, has even worsened.
Today, one in three in Egypt lives below the poverty line, with the currency having lost more than half of its value since 2016, the inflation rate at 10%, and those who want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket have to decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola, or the military, which is not only responsible for repression, but is also the largest economic actor: the military is building roads, houses, football stadiums, producing food, and much more.
Tuvs checks at the Terminal: BER boss: No more showstopper for the main airport.
Two months have been checked to see if the complicated system mesh works together with the BER-Brandschutz.
After major Tuv checks at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October of next year, which is, CEO Rainer Bretsaid after a meeting of the control board.
airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful test, but also said that there are still flaws to be dealt with in the terminal.
There are indications, however, that the temporary reserve is not likely to be too large, and the construction site is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of power cables are still to be remedied; the Tuev intends to review them by February.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is a matter of lack of proof, not so much of new cables, nor has it been released for all the dowels on which the cables hang, and the airport manager expects it to be available by the end of the year.
This year, there will be a new test of hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
The airport was originally scheduled to start operations in 2011, with costs rising from two billion euros to about 6.5 billion euros since construction began in 2006.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport, which is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board is to be held on 18 October, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is looking for two new managing directors: Financial director Heike Fölster changes to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, personnel chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen retires next year, as Bretschneider said, thanking Fölster for putting the airport finances firmly on her feet.
Chemnitz: Druze Automates - Police Stakes Man
He needed money for drugs - and for that he blew up several vending machines in the Chemnitz city area!
Over the last two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines that have been blown up in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply, causing millions of damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police took a 33-year-old German on the Bu � rgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the cause of explosion of explosives in the crime unit, with a particularly severe case of theft caused by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only was this suspicion against the 33.

Study on causes of heart disease
As a result of the increasing number of people suffering from heart disease, the number of people affected by this disease is increasing.
By analysing the genetic heritage of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
On Friday, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced that the Kühne Foundation is funding the project with EUR 12.5 million.

According to the clinic, more than 4,000 of the roughly 20,000 relevant human genes are currently known for possible disease-causing changes in DNA – so-called mutations – and about 200 would be added each year.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options such as prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disturbances, heart weakness and heart attacks.
The head of the Kuehne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong will to use the data to investigate other diseases.
According to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world.
According to UKE, human genetic inheritance can now be decrypted within 24 hours, with the mere cost of doing so amounting to €1300, while the world ’ s first genetic sequence, published in 2001, cost hundreds of millions more euros, and the study is expected to begin on October 1, 2010, with all 9000 samples analyzed by the end of 2020.
Nigeria ’ s Police Liberation Hundreds of Misguided Boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a school in the city of Kaduna in northern Nigeria, following evidence from local security forces, and have discovered some minor victims, as police officer Yakubu Sabo has reported.
The young were held under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran; in fact, the guards were held under "most degrading and inhuman conditions" by their teachers, said Sabo: about a in, including children of.
According to reports, the Koranic school has been in existence for about ten years, and local residents would have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility, and parents would have been shocked to learn about the conditions in the Koranic school, said Sabo, who had not foreseen the suffering of their children, and the operator and six staff were arrested according to the police.
Nigeria ’ s predominantly Muslim north has many private coran schools, which replace the often deficient state institutions, and the region ’ s people suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs, which is why, according to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to neighboring Niger over the past ten.
Assured and tortured, Nigeria ’ s police force is lifting 400 children out of school.
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria have freed almost 400 students from appalling conditions: 'Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries pointing to torture,' said police officer Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
On Thursday, the children were discovered in an Islamic school, where conditions were 'inhumane', and the officials arrested the head of the school and six teachers after the liberation operation.
The children, all boys, were kept as slaves at their school and chained to chains, some sexually abused, and television pictures showed poor and injured students in a clearly poor state of health.
World Football Election: Further Accusations of Messis and Klopps Kür
Football 'Signature Not valid'
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapidoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year.
After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, other countries have complained to Fifa, and Egypt has not been judged, on a curious basis.
In recent years, there has been a lot of bad news about Fifa: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its President, Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials.
But, having already complained that Nicaragua ’ s captain had not voted at all, other inconsistencies have emerged: Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Batry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account; indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting list.
Fifa apologises for the fact that 'the signatures on the forms had been filed in capital letters and therefore not valid', and has been contacted several times by the Egyptian Association to clarify the situation - without a reply.
Sudan ’ s Trainer puzzled
While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Association states that the coach, Zdravko Lugarisic, did not vote in the way it was finally judged: with Lionel Messi at number one, Virgil van Dijk at two, and Sadio Mané at three, according to Fif, with signatures and official stamp from the Sudanese Association.
Nicaragua's captain, Juan Barrera, had also accused me of not having voted for the # TheBest2019 Awards, and all my votes are wrong,, ” he,, and,,, and.
The announcement came from the Association on Friday: it was true, but of course it was not an intention: the ballot papers filled out were "mistakenly marked" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was stated in a communication from the Association, but the second captain, Manuel Rosas, elected "We take responsibility for the administrative error," said the communication, but both Rosas and team coach Henry Duvoted for Messi, "in FIFA's official list". "
The other cases have now been investigated by Fifa, but emphasises that the electoral process has been externally supervised by the consultancy PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
Ukraine ’ s Case: Ranghigh Republicans favor official investigation.
"I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this is from here, it is determined by the facts that are found," and he wants to know more about the whistleblowers affair before action is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, according to Scott, "for years."
The Republicans have so far been reluctant to criticize Trump for the whistleblowers affair, and few have shown unease. Scott ’ s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party, with the moderate governor of Virginia repeatedly challenging Trump ’ s policies, such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, argued for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said, "the right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate and get to the bottom of the matter.
Scott and Baker formally have no say in the US state governor ’ s case against Trump, which is being decided in Congress, so their remarks are mostly symbolically important, but even the first Republican senators have been critical of the situation, with Mitt Romney, for example, representing Utah in the second chamber of parliament, saying that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing."
The affair could result in Trump ’ s impeachment, the House Democrats have announced an investigation, accusing him of abusing power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment; with a majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make an “impeachment, ” but the decision to impeach him would fall in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority, so the chances of success are slim. So far, no US president has been impeached by an impeachment process.

Three men have been arrested in Sicily, allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after having illegally entered the port of Lampedusa with the rescue boat "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board.
"We can't rule out this, but we have no guaranteed information about it," said Ruben Neugebauer, spokesman of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, tortured and even murdered: they were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24).
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes on the ships: 'We cannot scan who the people are, who do not have passports,' said Neugebauer, and torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing from Libya, so it is very likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships', so it is'.
Italy ’ s right-wing ex-Interior Minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.

US dispute over financing for the bridge once more
The new financial year will start in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget, with the Senate following the House of Representatives on Thursday and deciding on transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending limits for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, the United States will once again have no spending plans ahead of the new fiscal year beginning on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have occurred on Monday at midnight, a federal government partial shutdown.
Shutdown Off
For the time being, the federal administration is being financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019, which is due to the fact that the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities.
The Democrats have enacted ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they hold the majority, but spending laws reflect Democrats ’ priorities, which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate, and the Senate has more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans that are unlikely to win a majority.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion to build the Wall, one of Trump ’ s main priorities. Democrats are disturbed by the wall plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects.
Separating the Wall
At the moment, it is not clear how the parties want to move closer on this issue, and more likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws over the next seven weeks is an extension of transitional financing beyond November 21, and no shutdown is ruled out.
In 1877, federal government funding would automatically continue at the level of the previous year, discourage parliamentarians from travelling and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were submitted.
France Allowing Lesbians and Singles to Fertilize
In France, artificial insemination is to continue to be open to all women and lesbians living in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that would allow all women to benefit from in-vitro fertilisation, which is likely to increase significantly the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
In the course of a three-day emotional debate, critics on the right had warned that many "children without a father" might grow up in the future.
The new regulation is the core of a Bioethics Act, which the Minister of Health, Agnès Buzyn, defended as an "opportunity" for society.
Further prohibition of insemination with sperm from dead husband
The National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected by a narrow majority an amendment to allow widows to have access to the sperm of their dead man for artificial insemination; in Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial insemination is permitted 'post-mortem'; in Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased person; in Paris, opponents of the offense argued that a child of this kind bears a 'particularly serious fate'.
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM), led by President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition, argued for artificial insemination with the sperm of the late partner, emphasizing that a widow would be subjected to a "double grief" if her husband's death unsatisfied her desire to have children.
The initiators of the amendment, which has now failed, consider it unfair that in future, a widow can be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
To date, artificial insemination is only permitted in France to heterosexual couples who cannot bear children, who must be married or live together for at least two years.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: Calls for air taxes to be paid to universities are louder
There is a lot of traffic going on at universities, which is why the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in future too, and the rectors say that they have no money for it, but now they are also coming under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying.
The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) have submitted a proposal to the Federal Ministry of Education, Research and Technology (BMBF) to the Federal Ministry of Education, Research and Technology (BMBF) for the implementation of the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BIBB) in cooperation with the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BIBB).
Russia Retains North Korean Fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the detainees are alleged to have fished illegally in Russian waters, and, ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested, when a shot was exchanged between the border guards and the crew of the boat, injuring three Russians and a North Korean, the fisherman later took his serious injuries, but this time there were no injured, it was said.
Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages, with North Korean fishermen travelling to Russian territorial waters, where Russia ’ s Coast Guard is patrolling its own claims to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 Tintenfish Captured
The new inspections found and confiscated 30,000 octopus on the boats and claimed that three fishing boats and two motorboats were confiscated and brought to Vladivostok after Nachodka and Posjet.
Russia ’ s fisheries authorities had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested for a while this year, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently complained about high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who fished with Russian-banned small-meshed synthetic nets, which would also take small creatures out of the sea, and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea where they would need 200 years to be broken up.
In the future, only 18,000: the US will lower the asylum ceiling.
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected White House police.
The richest country in the world is closing its doors to those seeking protection: as the State Department in Washington has confirmed, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be further lowered, and, in the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will be granted asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low threshold for receiving new refugees again, with a maximum of 18,000 people allowed in by 2020 in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, as the US State Department has said. In the nearly past year, the limit is 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has dramatically reduced the appetite for protection seekers from around the world in recent years, with much higher reception limits set by Barack Obama ’ s predecessor.
The target limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980, but the State Department called the US "the most impoverished and generous nation in history," a phrase that recalls the language used by the current US president.
“A responsible approach ” to refugees is aimed at enabling refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild, ” he said.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico that Trump is trying to tear down. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed a state of national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current action and current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure from the Selenskyj affair and a possible threat of impeachment.
According to the Foreign Office, the US government intends to focus in future on the admission of two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country, and who have been put at risk as a result, as stated in the Foreign Office statement, whereas a maximum of 1 500 refugees are to be received from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The United States wants people from this' northern triangle 'of Central America in particular to apply for asylum in other countries, and it is against that the United States has concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and with El Salvador and Honduras in order to stem immigration from the US border with.

Life-long stadium ban on racism in Italy
"@ officialasroma you already know what to do with such a fan.
The club responded late on Thursday by reporting the fans ’ account to Instagram and the police, and Roma supporters may never again attend a club game, the club wrote on Twitter.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, racism is a problem in Italian football, and Italian fans regularly chant racist abuse of the black players of rival teams: 'We cannot have racism in society or in sport; in Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious; it is necessary to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums', said Fifa-President Gianni Infantino at the weekend, and it was on the occasion of the statement that racist songs were heard at the first league party between Atalanta Bergamo and Florence last Sunday.

Conflict between Iran and the US: Rouhani talks about ending sanctions - Trump contradicts
On his return from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions, and the United States had promised an end to all sanctions in exchange for talks with Tehran ’ s leaders, said Rouhani on his official website.
But US President Donald Trump disagreed with his Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so that there would be a meeting." Of course, I said, "no.
"And America says I am lifting the sanctions," he added, "the type of sanctions that should be stopped has." And they have clearly said we. "
But, given the current sanctions and the "poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Rouhani in New York, with Europeans hoping to rescue the Iran nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China, which would prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Rouhani would meet US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
On Friday, the Turkish Vice President, Fuat Oktay, said that there were almost 200 aftershocks to Western Turkey following the earthquake that hit Turkey in a very short period of time.
According to a recent report by the European Commission on Human Rights, Human Rights Watch (AFP), the United Nations Security Council (IPCC) has confirmed that the United Nations Security Council has agreed to approve a new UN Security Council decision on Wednesday.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul ’ s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is the capital of the Kingdom of the Ottoman Empire.
The epicenter of Thursday ’ s earthquake was in the Marmara Sea, in front of the Silivri district and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as the Afad Civil Protection Agency reported.
On the occasion of the opening of the International Youth Day in Istanbul, the International Women ’ s Day (UEM) took place in Istanbul.
Istanbul is considered to be one of the most significant earthquakes in the world, and under the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called Northern Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian earth plates.
The city of Istanbul is the largest city in the world, and the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Istanbul,,,,,,,,,,,,, and.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Companies design emergency plans, private people have “go ” bags filled with everything they need next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth is wobbling,,, and.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured, and that some buildings had suffered minor damage, following developments from the Istanbul disaster (Ak).
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On the other hand, there is a great deal of panic in the social networks; buildings were wobbly; schools and hospitals were evacuated; telephone lines were interrupted; it was more violent than Tuesday ’ s, writes a user.
According to official data, the time of the earthquake is 1: 59 p.m. (local time).
On Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 struck the Turkish Marmarare region - it was felt until Istanbul.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a serious earthquake.
Researchers assume that, sooner or later, a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high; scientists believe that it will eventually erupt - and cause massive damage.
Ersoy said that the earthquake is now a warning, and that it is more likely, said CNN Türk, "This signs of a major earthquake,.
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul - and in Albania, there had been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured, and this year the earth was also shaken at Lake Constance.

The Kakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes the Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka ’ s famous novel “The Transfiguration ”, British successful author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on 27 November, announced by Diogenes Verlag (Zurich), about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his earlier life but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain, who sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is determined, in the process, not to be stopped by anything or anyone.
McEwan has been quoted as saying: 'When the parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers lie shamelessly as Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers are crying out for a no-deal disaster in high positions, a writer has to ask what he can do, and there is only one answer to it: write.'
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into an enormous infatuation", gradually being excluded from family and society and ultimately perish.

Thomas Cook, who had fallen into the insolvency of the parent company in the United Kingdom, filed an application for bankruptcy on Wednesday.
Insurers Will Transfer Hotels From Now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad that are currently housing Thomas-Cook holidaymakers are to receive money from the insurance company.
On the basis of the booking information and without the presentation of separate invoices, hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as one of the spokespersons of the German Press Agency said.
The insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own data, were forced to pay for their own accommodation on the spot, so some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table.
On Friday, the airline announced that it has signed a new agreement with the Australian airline, the Australian Air Force.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, if you are travelling with a group of people, you should be aware that you are travelling with a group of people and that you are travelling with a group of people.
As it stands, the company has left open the way to travel with start from November 1, 2019 and, in consultation with insolvency insurance, it has been said that the further procedure will be examined.
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera.
Prince Harry Destroyed Angola ’ s Explosive Mine
For a long time now, Prince Harry has been pursuing Lady Diana ’ s commitment and is now walking directly in Africa in the footsteps of his mother.
In Angola, British Prince Harry, wearing a blue shark-protection waistcoat, set fire to and destroyed an explosive mine.
On Friday morning, when Halo Trust, a British camp at the site of Dirico, put his house in front of current TV cameras.
On the fifth day of his Africa tour, Harry wanted to walk straight into the city of Huambo in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997), with the same warlock that once his mother, he wanted to travel the path she.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African tour since Monday, which started in the South African tourist capital Cape Town.
Stopping Brexit Negotiations: The Danger of No Deal remains acute.
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made it clear that there will be no third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but what remains of eternal duration in the polarized British. The Supreme Court ’ s recent judgment in Britain hovers like a sword of Damocles over the blonder ’ s head, with its suspension of parliament to pursue its Brexit course stubbornly until the exit date annulled earlier this week, and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend the bilateral talks until 31 October in the event of failed negotiations with the EU, which Johnson categorically ruled out.
Boris Johnson deems Deal Possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass much of Johnson either, as he suggested when he visited a hospital that he would support an extension of negotiations until the end of October if he did not do so:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
I am cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And the Brexit negotiators in Brussels are running out of time, with the EU and British negotiators still having some six weeks to avoid Britain ’ s withdrawal from the European Union without an agreement. But the recent talks have failed to achieve a breakthrough again. An agreement by the end of October now seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not enact the law, a further postponement of the exit date is in force, but the opposition does not trust the prime minister ’ s words, fearing that Johnson might somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.

The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country, according to which the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi, who has ruled the country since 2013, after toppling the democratically elected Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, with thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers, and activists imprisoned and partly convicted in recent years.
Ocean Change: Arved Fuchs from Greenland Expedition back
Arctic explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday and was welcomed on his arrival at the Port of Hamburg by the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thuberg, who had brought the race yacht "Malizia" across the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship Dagmar Aaen on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher, who waited for years for the young generation to speak, and who knew for decades that the earth was warming up.
"What happens on the sea often takes place in isolation from the public," Fuchs said.
Arved Fuchs is a great model for all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, "said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony.

A phone call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could indeed face impeachment proceedings after the tumultuous revelations of recent days, Democrats want to examine it as soon as possible – weeks to make a decision..
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj reportedly began, and the whistleblowers ’ charge, which ultimately brought the conversation to the public with his complaint out of concern for national security and US democracy, is monstrous: the president has used the power of his office to use another country ’ s government to influence the 2020 election, using Ukraine ’ s dependence to blackmail it and forcing it to act against a political opponent.
The core of this effort can also be found in the now-released transcript of the interview with Selenskyj, though it does not reflect the full text, but the July 25 phone call is only an episode of a much larger story, centered above all on Trump ’ s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
History begins from the public's point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine; he wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation into what we have the right to do," he says inappropriate to the newspaper: one might think it is, but "this is not illegal." Giuliani wants an investigation in Ukraine, in - ",,,,, and..
The attorney and former New York mayor seem to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump ’ s opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton spiked with actors in Ukraine, critics said, to create an occasion for the US Russia investigation, but that charge was never taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk so prominently about on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giulianis and the president is that former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, urged the dismissal of then-Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin, as the Obama administration ’ s Ukrainian envoy, to stop the gas company ’ s investigation, for which he was responsible, with his son, Hunter Biden, on the board.
In fact, when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General should go, the gas company ’ s investigations had already been completed, with Hunter Biden never directly affected, and Schokin himself accused of deeply corrupt behavior, with the US government far from being the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal, and the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation of the company.

Musk needs a record to achieve his high goals, and in 2019 he plans to deliver a total of 360 ’ 000 to 400 ’ 000 cars, with six figures required for the current and coming quarter year.
Does the UK government want to circumvent Brexit law?
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains oblivious to whether he is seeking ways to circumvent Parliament ’ s recent anti-Brexit law, and, on a question, he merely told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal if no agreement was reached with the EU by mid-October, Johnson criticises it as a "surrender law" that made negotiations with the EU more difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major suggested that Johnson might try to use "political chicanery" to circumvent the law, and Johnson could use a procedural ploy to postpone the law's entry into force until after leaving the EU.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union: 'We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way forward is with an agreement'.
Iran seems to be touting uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has stepped up the pressure on the European contractors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, the European states are showing incompetence or unwillingness when it comes to concrete action," he said at a press conference on Thursday at the margins of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and in, he "" from the 2015 agreement.
The US stepped out of the deal alone in 2018 to force Iran, with "maximum pressure", to change course in its perceived aggressive Middle East policy. President Donald Trump ’ s administration wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditionality, and is now back on harsh sanctions against Tehran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using, or at least prepared to use, the centrifuges installed in early September.
Perhaps Europeans were unwilling to bear their share of the deal, leaving the Iranians alone, presumed Rouhani, with the costs and burdens of US sanctions, but there will still be further talks, which I hope will bring about a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran ’ s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
But the mix changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, following Monday's US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the in Yemen, in in in in US. in in in in in in, in in in in in in US in in in in in in in in in in in in in
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence," Rowhani said, but European leaders would not have been able to do so in talks with him during the UN general debate; instead, they would have merely claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this; Rouhani had met German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, Rouhani demanded that the US administration ’ s far-reaching sanctions be lifted, calling on the Washington administration to shift to a policy of “dialogue and reason. ”
Crossed by another Star
Astronomers are now observing a comet from the depths of the outer space, which had been achieved before.
What was initially only a conjecture is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses our solar system.
On 30 August, the long-winded comet was discovered by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter.
2I / Borisov is, after 1I / 'Oumuamua of 2017, only the second interstellar object that was sighted during a flight through our solar system.
2I / Borisov provides astronomers with a rare opportunity to get a glimpse of a strange solar system from close range before they can see it again.
According to the analysis, the comet is on the way to a so-called hyper trajectory that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced, and is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies.
The Astronomers are lucky: unlike 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been spotted, leaving researchers many months to study, "the object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will with medium sized telescopes until in April 2020," explained Farnocchia.
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor, such as Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already conducted the characterisation of 1I / 'Oumuamua, in an initial study determining the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 km.
Researchers from the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar welding star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The of this object from comets of our solar system, and,," said researcher Julia de León. comets in other solar systems may be, in, in, in the, in the,,, in, and. in, in, in,, in,,, in,, in, in, in, in, in, and in, in, in the in in, in
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors in just two years indicates that these objects could open up a new way of investigating certain processes in other solar systems.
According to Esa-WissenschaftsDirector Günther Hasinger, the agency wants to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position at 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, or to listen to an interstellar visitor like 1I / 'Oumuamua.
Beijing ’ s New Mega-Airport Daxing First Landing
Just in time for the 70th anniversary of the People ’ s Republic of China, the Chinese capital ’ s first passenger aircraft, a special honor for captain and crew, arrived at the new mega airport in the south of China ’ s capital.
China ’ s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion dollar project, and China ’ s most recent prestige project is called “sea stars ” because of its six-poor building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will be extended to seven later, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system.
It is also possible to get a ticket from the airport to the airport.
The New Oversound Aircraft is scheduled to fly from London to Sydney in 2030: four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours, the UK Space Agency dreams of making this supersonic flight, scheduled for the 2030s, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, CNN quoted the agency, "This is the technology that could definitely be accomplished," said agency Graham Turnock.
In the early 1980s, the Concorde was the only airline to fly from New York City to the Australian metropolis, where it had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until the end of 2003, taking three to three and a half hours.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," says Reaction Engines on its homepage.
Recovering Washington: Trump ’ s Gathering anonymous Tipper in Ukraine
In the Ukraine affair of US President Donald Trump ’ s possible abuse of power, he wants to find possible leaks in the White House.
“I want to know who gave the whistleblowers the information, ” Trump said in front of United Nations officials in New York on Thursday, who was almost“ a spy, ” and treated.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate donors, but the event was not actually open to the public on Friday, but several US media reported audio recordings of the speech, and Democrats were outraged by the president ’ s statement.
On Tuesday, the Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced preparations for impeachment against Trump, based mainly on a written complaint by an anonymous intelligence worker making serious allegations against Trump and his central office, and on strong public pressure, the announcement was made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants information from several government officials that the US president "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country interferes in the US election of 2020 in his favor.
At the heart of the charges is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that might harm his political rival, Joe Biden, who was doing business in Ukraine earlier by Biden ’ s son, Hunter, and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukraine ’ s judiciary. Biden is ahead of the race for democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukrainian telephone, saying that senior government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover, but, as usual, an electronic text protocol had been drawn up, which was removed from a database normally provided for by White House jurists and stored instead in a specially protected system.
The intelligence agency's identity is not publicly known; the New York Times reported that intelligence officers. intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence. intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence intelligence. intelligence intelligence
On Friday, Trump once again questioned the source ’ s credibility; in a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the “whistleblower ” had spread second-hand information that might have turned out to be inaccurate, so there may be no tippers or spies.
But, as Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have provided information to Whistleblower, he was outraged. US House President Nancy Pelosi responded with concern and complained that Trump ’ s statement was undermining the government ’ s integrity.
In the House of Representatives, several parliamentary committees have been conducting various investigations against Trump and his entourage for months. Given Ukraine ’ s allegations, the Democrats are now pushing an investigation with renewed vigor to initiate a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
“The Whistleblower has given us a road map for our investigation, ” said the head of the House of Representatives ’ Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, who attacked the ship, reproached him for misrepresenting the situation, and called again for the committee chairman ’ s resignation, who routinely,,, months ago.
More than 300 former US security and foreign policy officials, most of whom served under Democratic and Republican presidents, backed the Democrats ’ investigation of possible impeachment in a statement released on Friday. If the allegations were true, it would be “a ruthless abuse of power ” by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the process to proceed, with a majority in the House of Representatives that would allow Democrats to pursue an impeachment process, but the decision to impeach him would fall in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans are in the majority, so the chances of success are slim. So far, no US president has been impeached by an impeachment process.
VW works council: jobs are being cut 'creeping'.
The Volkswagen brand ’ s plans to cut costs further in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe, a concern that drives the works council of the automobile manufacturer, which wants to reduce its annual factory costs of €10 billion by €2 billion by 2023, of which €500 million is to be saved this year.
The "Future Pact", negotiated between companies and works councils in 2016, already provides for the loss of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020.
However, as our newspaper has learned from business council circles, jobs in production that are not actually available are gradually being dismantled by another route - that is, by passing the official course - which often means that vacant regular posts would not be occupied again.
In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing the reoccupation, and there are now a lot of staff lacking, the compression of labour is on the increase, concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicle works are on the increase, and so there is also a fear that vehicle production might gradually be taken out of Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world, and the only thing we heard from the VW is that the volume of employment will be adjusted along the demographic curve in a socially acceptable way, as agreed.
The Volkswagen brand wants to standardize production worldwide and centrally manage new projects, which will also reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim of which is to increase productivity and hence competitiveness.
This year, for example, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year for the first time since 2013.
20 hours.
The Volkswagen Group, which is based in Wolfsburg, Germany, is the only Volkswagen factory in which vehicles are produced.
As production director Tostmann announced last year, Wolfsburg is expected to release a million cars from the band "in perspective", which is intended to make it possible to combine the golf production in the parent plant - because the Zwickau plant is converting into a location for electric car production.
The Golf is also the most popular sport in the world, and is one of the most popular sports in the world.
Forcing Prostitution with Voodoo
Young women from Nigeria have been arrested, dragged into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected human traffickers have been imprisoned.
On Friday in Bochum, six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to prison sentences of up to eight years and three months.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old and, with the help of Libyan smugglers, they were brought across the Mediterranean in rubber boats, but the dream of a better future was not fulfilled; in Germany, they were distributed to different brothels to deal with the alleged smuggling costs of an average of EUR 25 000, so they were paid completely.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted that the young Nigerians were smuggling into brothels and then distributing them on brothels.
The verdicts are on commercial and banditry of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo Calls for Negotiations with Lufthansa
The airline trade union Ufo has once again threatened to strike at FIM ’ s ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "inform on 14 October of the industrial dispute measures in the LH Group", informed Daniel Flohr on Friday.
On this point, after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court, Ufo now sees itself strengthened, and Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not cancelled, and the court rejected the applications, confirming the decision and examining the appeal against them.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court for a judicial review of the union's status, arguing that the union had not appointed a board of for months and that it was unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was followed by a major leadership dispute in the Spartan Trade Union, during which many members of the Board of Directors and the Advisory Board resigned, including the long-time trade union chief, Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had suspended an initial vote, due to doubts about its leadership, on Cabinet strikes at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated Immigration: Saudi Arabia announces a new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is now to change, with the Persian Gulf country seeking to introduce new visa arrangements.
Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future with a new visa system, and by 2030 international visitors, tourism.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the Chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
The United Kingdom is the largest country in the world, and is the largest country in the world.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones struck two of Saudi Arabia ’ s major oil plants in the east: the country ’ s largest oil refinery in Abkaik, and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production plummeted, oil price drops soared, and it is likely to take several weeks before the Kingdom ’ s oil production returns to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are preparing for a wedding.
In addition, she has appeared in a number of films, including a number of films, such as The Adventures of Superman, The Adventures of Superman and The Adventures of Superman.
Justin posted several colorful suits on Instagram, including bananas, and asked his followers: "Help me choose my wedding smoking".

It is also possible to find a military helicopter which is still in operation.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction.
As well as pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging, and urban growth are the causes of the threat, the IUCN World Conservation Union reported on Friday in Brussels, which examined the stock of all 454 species known in Europe, 265 of which are not found on any other continent, 58% of which are under threat, 66 already at the highest level of risk, and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", "endangered", "extinct in nature" to "extinct".
Ebere and Wild Rosschestnut Threat
As one of the authors, David Allen, said of the German Press Agency, "Most are threatened because the populations are small or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It is also a bad thing for the wild common horse chestnut, which has been considered "endangered" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale, the biggest threat in is Balkan mini-, spreading from southeast Europe since in the (Hippocastanu) in in Europe, in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in
Straddling and Moose
The IUCN scientists have simultaneously created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses, with more than one-fifth of molluscs and mosses and nearly half of all ostriches under threat, according to the IUCN, mainly as a result of the destruction of the wilderness, of imported species, agricultural practices, and climate change.
'This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet, 'said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europe Bureau,' We must limit the impact of man on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority '.

Cook Failure: Get Money from Insurance Hotels
According to a press report, some banks are likely to find the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook costly, with high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans, including Credit Suisse, as reported in the Financial Times on Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to write down a total of up to GBP 1.8 billion (about EUR 2 billion) on their books, according to estimates by the consultancy AlixPartners.
An expert told the story, bondholders would have to accept write-downs of £900 million to £1 billion and lenders of £550 to £825 million, with the actual write-offs likely to be at the upper end of the bandwidths.
A person close to this procedure did not express much hope, for example, Thomas Cook's 40 or so aircraft in the UK were "old" and many of the properties were in bad conditions.
Rackete is alleged to have brought suspected murderers to Italy.
The Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule that out, but we do not have any reliable information about it," said the spokesman of the refugee organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.

The US Wars Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting China ’ s network equipment supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too big, "said Pai to the" Handelsblatt "with a view to building up the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law," which requires any company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
Current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, "said the FCC chief, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of trust" from suppliers.
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "Handelsblatt" reports on the basis of its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible.
It is the software that is important to keep the devices up to date.
It would be "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The company that supposedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government, "said Pai to the" Handelsblatt ".
The US would learn that government officials were placed within the company, and Pai recently went to Berlin to promote the US position.
Chemical plant in northern France burns: schools closed.
A gigantic fire wall lit the sky above a chemical factory in North France.
After a fire at a chemical factory in the northern French town of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches in the region will be closed.
The Ministry of the Interior had called on citizens to remain in buildings as far as possible and not to be exposed to the smoke, and farmers and breeders were urged to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture indicated, and there was still a risk that smell would spread after deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter.
A gigantic black smoke column had emerged from the chemical factory and French media reported huge flames and explosions at the Lubrizol plant, which produces oil additives.
According to the authorities, the Normandy factory belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored.
The city is located on the banks of the River Seine, in the heart of the river Seine.
Rouen is the capital of France, and is the capital of the United Kingdom.
French Finance Minister: 'Germany must invest now'
France ’ s Economics and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest, and it must invest now, the sooner the better, "said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The eurozone economy was on the weak, the minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to deteriorate in order to take the necessary decisions'.
Action would have to be taken by those states that have budgetary room for more investment, said Le Maire, with a view, among other things, to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, pointing to its country's high public debt, which is more than 98% of GDP, and the French public debt must be 'stabilised' and 'reduced', Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy, in exchange for which German politicians have repeatedly called on France to manage its budget deficit.
The French 2020 budget presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government is thus responding to, among other things, the protests of the Yellow West movement, which is expected to fall to 2.2%, down from 3.1% this year.
Is he still trying to trick?
The British Prime Minister, Johnson, sharply criticises Parliament's "surrender law".
The British parliament is back, and a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a Chaos-Broxite, but critics fear that Boris Johnson may use a loophole, but the Tory politician is sidestepping this possibility.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains oblivious to whether he wants to push through an unregulated Brexit, despite the legislation that Parliament recently passed, which is precisely what to prevent. On a related question, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal if no agreement was reached with the EU by mid-October, Johnson criticises it as a "surrender law" that made negotiations with the EU more difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major suggested that Johnson might try to use "political chicanery" to circumvent the law, and that the prime minister could use a procedural ploy to postpone the law's entry into force until after leaving the EU.
Meanwhile, Johnson ’ s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, declared that he felt the political disputes over Brexit as a “walk in the park, ” and was confident that the desired exit from the EU will come about:“ We enjoy that, we will win, we will leave, ” said Cummings in a book.
Cummings, who led the “Vote Leave ” campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, now serves as the chief strategist in the UK ’ s Downing Street seat, behind the hard-line policies that put the prime minister in an almost hopeless situation.
Linda McCartney's Polaroid Diaries
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the big rock photographers, but it doesn't have to be the big glamour.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda's death in 1998 from 1969 to 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "# ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting glimpse into the life of an exceptional pre-Instagram family, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film.
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always present, with thousands of Polaroids doing it, several hundred of which are now being released for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
In his preface, the art critic Ekow Eshun writes that there is always a focus on one thing: your husband Paul - as one might have never seen him before.
She was born in New York City, New York, and raised in New York City.
The Olympus Mju 790 SW digital SLR camera is the first camera to be introduced in the United States.
It's about deciding the click: you have to recognize when a great photo is going on in front of you, and then you have to pick it at exactly the right moment, "said Paul McCartney," If, two seconds later or two seconds, it,,, and, "said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Polaroid Diaries" is not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, it is also a great aesthetic pleasure, in addition to all the anecdotes, where landscapes already seem like abstract paintings.
'We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran '
Turkey continues to import oil and gas from its neighbors, despite US sanctions against Iran, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview released on Friday that Turkey cannot cut off oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our gas from there, "said Erdogan in New York, where he took part in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "withdrawn because of US threats."
Nevertheless, 'especially on this issue and on many other issues, Turkey will continue our relations with Iran', said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic.
Its sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran ’ s oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably in recent months.
The US Administration ’ s Retention of Refugees
On Thursday, the US State Department declared that the annual ceiling for a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, equivalent to a 40% cut.
The State Department has declared that, while the US remains committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens, and that the US immigration system is now.
The US government intends to focus in the future on the admission of two refugee groups: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus at risk, as stated in the Foreign Office statement, whereas a maximum of 1 500 refugees are to be received from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The program, launched in 1980, selected refugees from UN camps around the world and resettled in the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program ’ s history. Already, the current limit of 30,000 is low. When US President Donald Trump ’ s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was close to 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted in horror to the announced reduction of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee, which would further damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to limit immigration to the US strictly, both legally and illegally, with the US government, according to its own data, expecting 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year, which are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - 'Get Close to a Spittle'
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of spying, and anyone who has hinted at the informant who accuses him of abusing power “comes close to a spy, ” Trump said in a record of a private event in New York on Thursday.
So, when asked about the person who informed the whistleblowers about controversial events in the White House, Trump replied, “It ’ s a spy, ” and then Trump added,“ Do you know what we did in the old days when we were smart?
Observers valued the latter remark as a possible reference to the death penalty. Democrats sharply criticized Trump ’ s statements, accusing him of intimidating witnesses, and an attempt to obstruct a congressional inquiry into a possible impeachment case, wrote the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and House Supervision Committees.
In a now published complaint, Whistleblower accuses the president of abusing his office to seek another country ’ s interference in the 2020 US election, including his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: in the conversation, Trump suggested that he investigate his possible democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is unclear who the whistleblowers themselves and their whistleblowers are, but, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be a CIA foreign intelligence analyst.
Careless Refugee Boots: Baby and Infants drowned in Aegean
Time and again, people are trying to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea, with boats that are often far too small sinking, and seven migrants have died as a result of the sinking of a dinghy, including five children.
The Greek Coast Guard reported that seven migrants died from the sinking of a dinghy, including one baby and four other children, and that four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Inousses is situated between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are crossing the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in far too small boats, and last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Cancels Concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who came to an abrupt end due to an indisposition of lead singer Roger Daltrey.
After the release of the album, Townsend released a new album, "The Way of the Warrior", which was released on October 21, 2009.
The band was founded 55 years ago by Daltrey, a 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old Townsend band.
Renting Suddenly: WeWork Gets Real Estate Markets
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
In just a few years, WeWork has grown from a small startup to a driving force in the world ’ s most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis, with landlords fearing for billions of dollars in revenue.
WeWork ’ s crisis threatens to upset the balance in the world ’ s largest real estate markets, with the company hiring founder Adam Neumann as CEO a few days ago, postponing the planned IPO and starting to sell subsidiaries and assets such as the Privatjet to executives in order to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months.
WeWork ’ s long-term long-term lease of large office space, which can be individual freelancers, small startups, or entire departments of large corporations, has driven money out of the business at a staggering rate.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into rental contracts with maturities of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion, which could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire property markets.
The economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York has calculated that WeWork rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan over the past 24 months, one of the world ’ s most expensive real estate markets. WeWorks ’ s new contracts alone meant that the demand for offices in New York was greater than that of the new areas that came onto the market at the time. Without WeWorks Expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased in this period, as Alpert wrote in the Business Insider.
In the UK capital, too, the balance of the real estate market could shift significantly without further expansion of aggressive startups, including WeWork, in office in, investment in,, investment, investment,,,,,,,, and,,,,,,, and.,,,,, and,, and,,, and
If WeWork is to make its business model profitable soon, property owners would probably have to write off some of the billions of dollars they had hoped for.
Russia Reclaimed numerous North Korean Fishermen
The Russian Coastguard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen, and in the last few days a total of 262 poachers have been arrested, who have fished illegally in the waters, according to the Interfax agency, the Russian National Security Service (FSB) reported on Friday.
Just ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested, while the border guards had previously been shot down and three were injured, this time there were no injuries, it was said, and Communist North Korea is suffering from a chronic food shortage.
The Russian Coast Guard, according to its own data, is patrolling its marine biological resources, and re-checks have detected 30,000 octopus, and claims that three fishing and two motor boats have been seized and transferred to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. The Coast Guard, according to Ria Nowosti, identified more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested for a while in 2019, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently complained about high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who fished with Russian-banned small-meshed synthetic nets, which would also take small creatures out of the sea, and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea where they would need 200 years to be broken up, and the ships themselves would not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured in the arrests earlier this week; another wounded North Korean later died, according to the FSB; on September 17, Russian border guards first held a North Korean boat, and then a second one after it opened the fire.
Ban US Travel on ex-President Castro
The United States Department of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on Thursday stating that Castro had taken part in "gross human rights violations" and that he was in charge of a system in which thousands of Cubans were arbitrarily arrested and more than 100 political prisoners.
"The Cuban regime's disregard for human rights and use of force to prop up the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump, among others, issued a visa ban on Venezuela ’ s government and military personnel on Wednesday, with months of fierce power struggle raging in Venezuela between the government and the opposition, with the US imposing a series of sanctions on Maduro ’ s government to bring him to his knees and to power the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president, Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is considered to be one of Maduro's closest allies; the Socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of posted doctors; and, according to the United States and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government repress opponents of the government.
New Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world, starting with New Zealand and Australia, before protests across Europe move to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunderberg wanted to take part in a major rally in Montreal, Canada, and to rally outside the White House in Washington.
"Last Friday, more than four million people attacked the climate," she wrote on Twitter, so far actions in,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On Friday, the rally in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, as well as in smaller towns and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, is scheduled to take place in at least in. in in in Germany in in in the in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in
In August 2018, at the age of 15, Thun stood up to the Swedish parliament to call on its country ’ s politicians to make a greater commitment to climate protection, which led to the Fridays-for-Food movement in a short space of time.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be reduced to below 1.5 degrees relative to pre-industrial times.
On Monday, she delivered an emotional speech to the UN in which she spoke forcefully to the world ’ s leaders, and on Wednesday, in her native Stockholm, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize by the Right Livelihood Foundation for her commitment to climate change.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
The Russian people will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony, which provides for a change in fire protection, "including for smoking," a spokesman of the Ministry of Emergency said in Moscow on Thursday, according to the Tass agency, that the ban should enter into force on 1 October.
If you smoke, you will have to pay a fine of 3,000 rubles (€42.46), and if the cigarette causes a fire, the penalty will be higher.
Shoot Cybercrime investigators Shoot Up Servers
In the fight against Internet crime, German investigators have, for the first time, extracted a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites on which internationally operating criminals have operated their activities as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Torbach an der Moselle.
He was arrested on Thursday evening in a major action by the Public Prosecutor's office in Koblenz, Germany.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (ADD) has issued a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to investigate the alleged alleged terrorist attacks.
This is the first time a hoster has been built up in Germany.
The access action, supported by special units such as the GSG9, has been subject to searches in Germany and neighbouring countries, resulting from nearly five years of investigations, and at midday the investigators want to provide further details.
Fridays for Future's New Global Climate Protests
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller towns and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests  Who are actually Thun ’ s backers?
In a world full of war and smoke plants that warms the climate, justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century.
On the one hand, Greta Thuberg sets the crowds in motion and forces young people to rise up for a better climate friendly world.

Comet discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Through our Solar System
A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The conjectures of astronomers have been confirmed: A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system.
2I / Borisov: Komet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body in question was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea, who looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and other observations confirmed his first suspicion.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain a closer insight into a strange solar system.
Comet has already been spotted before flight - and can be observed for several months.
"The object will reach the maximum brightness in mid-December and will be visible with medium sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency, Nasa. "After that, it will be observed only with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
Getting to grips with Comet 2I / Borisov raises scientific hopes.
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter, while the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of silence is similar to ours.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.

"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson aghast Brother
He was born in New York City, New York, and moved to at.
On Wednesday, at the time of Question Time in the House of Commons, this was met with massive opposition indignation, and more critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the channel Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, hanged, divided, tested, and punched," which they found highly reprehensible, not to recognize the version of their brother, said Rachel Johnson, who was standing in the European Parliament elections for the anti-Brexit party, Change UK.
She was particularly struck by her brother, Jo Cox, a pro-EU member of the House of Commons who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi just days before the 2016 Brexit referendum, whose memories can best be honoured by pushing Brexit through, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons: "It is very distasteful to refer to a member murdered by someone who called Britain first," now Johnson's sister criticized.
"It makes me sick if Jos's name is used in this way," he tweeted, and the best way to honor them is to argue passionately and resolutely for what you believe to be the case, no matter what view you think, but never to "demonize the other side," he also complained that an atmosphere was created in which attacks became more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson ’ s younger brother, Jo, had resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory MP. “I have been torn over recent months between loyalty to the family and national interest – it is an indissoluble tension, ” explains Jo Johnson.
Johnson's language was also sharply criticized in the Church, where, according to the Times, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that was "unworthy of this country." In a joint statement, they said: "In recent days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside Parliament, and we should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear in the Super Bowl.
The NFL ’ s 100-year existence is a strong signal: two women with Latino roots appear in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, promising an explosion of fun and energy.
Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the upcoming finals of the US Football League NFL.
"I feel incredibly honoured and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, who has an incredible strength in the US," said Shakira in a video.
Shakira ("Waka Waka") is a city in the South of Florida.
"I love the Super Bowl setting two women on stage - and two Latinas," said Lopez, sending an important message to all Americans and the world, promising for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
She was born in New York City after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico; in the 2000's, she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish.
Shakira was born in Los Angeles, California.
In the US, half-time guests are expected to be announced with excitement every time, and this year many see the choice as a political gesture, because the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump ’ s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest sporting event in the United States and a huge advertising spectacle.
In the United States, the United States is the only country in the world to have a record label in the United States.
An actor and youtube turns Egypt ’ s rulers into rulers: for the time being, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to remain abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether blood is flowing back on the streets of Egypt spent the last week abroad; one of them was back at Cairo airport on Friday; President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly; the former general who removed Muslim Brotherhood Mohammed Morsi, the country ’ s first freely elected head of state in 2013, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi ’ s actions against political Islam and had not lost a syllable about human rights violations at the Nile – in a week in which Egypt ’ s security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president.
Ali, who is currently in the streets of Egypt, is a man who, according to the president, is trying to fool himself: Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, escaping the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil.
As the country ’ s leading army leader, on which Sisi bases his rule, throws up corruption and enrichment.
After last week, for the first time since Sisi's grip on power, thousands had demonstrated against his rule, and nearly 2,000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers, and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday, a Friday protests,,,,,,, and,,, and.
On Friday, a massive police presence was reported from the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators ripped banner pieces with the president ’ s portrait last week; security checkpoints erected in the city and along the streets of failure; in Cairo, several underground stations in the city were closed for "maintenance work"; most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked; and in Rabaa Square, where supporters of the deposed Muslim Brotherhood Morsi conspired in 2013 until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent disgruntled people from gathering: Sisis ’ s Future Party wanted to hold a large-scale demonstration here, of all people.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements change his tactics: "Our goal must not be Tahrir Square," Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera, "Don't let us clash with police officers," but as a climb-down: "All Egypt is Tahrir Square".
When the Provider Promises Too Much
If the Internet connection appears to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are several ways to check.
If you enter into an Internet contract, you do not need to trust the speed information of the providers blindly.
After all, the previously promised transmission rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre in Bavaria.
If the connection appears to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test possibilities.
"However, the supplier tests are based on the specific requirements of the supplier and are therefore not calculated in a uniform and objective manner", says the consumer centre of Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days for the supplier to produce the promised service.
If this does not happen after several requests, customers can cancel and claim damages, but if, will only.
The Republican First Researcher
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it is from here, it is determined by the facts that are found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday, wanting to know more about the whistleblowers affair before action is taken - an impeachment process can lead to the president being deposed.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly telephoned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, for Trump has been “watching Biden for years. ”
Republicans have so far resisted criticism of Trump for the whistleblowers affair, and few have shown discomfort. Scott ’ s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man in the MCU: Another Marvel Film
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August, Sony and Marvel would go separate ways, so Tom Hollands Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avenger" universe.
The film is based on a series of films, which are based on a series of films, and which are based on a series of films.
In the "Screenrant" magazine, Marvel Boos quotes Kevin Feige: "I am pleased that Spidey's path is continuing in the MCU, and I and all of us at the Marvel Studios are delighted that we can continue working on it... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on its spy verse, and you never know what the future will bring.

So Herzogin Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the Suits Final.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the big finale in the United States, with many happy endings and just as many cameo appearances, as well as the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who played in the series for many years, receiving a charming tribute.
In the final, Herzogin Meghan did not return for a final farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes; instead, some glimpses once again revealed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess, such as the moments of the failed and successful marriage with Mike or how she welcomes him after his sentence.

Aegean: Baby and four other children drowned in boat accidents
A baby and four other children drowned while capsizing a refugee boat in the Aegean; seven people died, as the Greek Coast Guard said on Friday; the nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland, and four children, three women and five men.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wants to find out in Turkey what the refugee situation is, said Seehofer on Friday, and then he wants to learn more about the 'administrative problems of the Greeks' in Athens in order to help deal with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson of the EU Commission confirmed Seehofer ’ s planned trip with the EU ’ s interior commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, and Christophe Castaner, France ’ s interior minister.
On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, according to the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increased figures have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants illegally entering the Greek islands via Turkey, in exchange for receiving a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian who has been deported.
However, due to a lack of human resources, it is difficult to deal with asylum applications on the Greek side.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 have there been so many, reported by the State Round Radio.

A Green Lawmaker for embarrassing Photopane
The leader of Canada ’ s Green Party, Elizabeth May, campaigned on this, so was the cup rigged?
The Canadian Green boss holds a multi-way hand on a photo, but now it has come out: the cup has been manipulated.
The Canadian National Post reported that the recycled coffee cup with metal straw had never been held in the hands of Elizabeth May, the leader of the Canadian Green Party.
The Green Leader Must Respond for the Photopane
The National Post then accused May of manipulation, and that the Party produces fake news to be more credible about “environmental protection, ” in the midst of an election campaign to the House of Commons, in which Trudeau, too, finds it increasingly difficult to corrupt.
The photo went viral in the social media and intensified the discussion about fake news.
May was shocked and prayed on her blog that she had not known about this action.
May writes that she is suffering for the employee who has done so: 'I do not want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide,' she says to the Guardians and at the same time she asks herself of her dedicated team: 'If they again want to work on an image, could they not do what with my face, so that I look younger?'
The German Green Party (Green Party) has also been advised to use disposable plastic or air travel in Shitstorms - but their pictures were not shot.
Influencecerin wants free upgrade: lifelong flight ban at Cathay
She is said to have received an email from Cathay Pacific requesting an upgrade, but when she asked for it at check-in she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Upon check-in, many passengers dream of an instant upgrade to Business Class, sometimes lucky, and the economy class staff offer a free change.
This case shows how not to do it: A self-declared Influencrin has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade.
On the way back, the airline ’ s Jaqueline staff refused to upgrade, even though they reported an email announcing that their Cathay Pacific had promised an upgrade.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight, this time the woman reported the same mail, but with a different reference number.
The airline staff at the airport canceled jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific.
In her case, the Influencecerin turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because, while Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the meta data of the mail, the case remains clear: Cathay has committed fraud, it remains closed for future flights, and the airline's terms and conditions also say that it does not have to pay the new flight, which Jaqueline does not want to settle for - and now uses a lawyer.
Oil Prices After Yemen ’ s Armistice Report
Oil prices dropped by more than a dollar on Friday afternoon in a very short space of time, with a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent costing $61.83 – about 1.4% less than the previous day.
The coup was triggered by a report by the Wall Street Journal on a cease-fire in Yemen, with Saudi Arabia agreeing to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil assets had brought down five per cent of global oil production in mid-September. The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in Yemen ’ s civil war had called for the attacks; Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran; a ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region.
If an agreement is reached, it can focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, head of the Commodity Strategy Department at Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices are continuing to decline in recent days, with a barrel of WTI oil costing nearly $59 a week ago, Brent costing nearly $65.
Most recently, citing insiders, Bloomberg reported that after the mid-September attack, oil repair operations in Saudi Arabia were moving faster than expected, with output reaching eight million barrels a day and moving again toward the original amount.
Most recently, there have been press reports, citing insiders, that Saudi Aramco, a state-owned oil company, is making rapid progress in repair work, but commodity experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is now planning to go public and avoiding negative headlines.
At the same time, the conflict between Iran and Western countries was beginning to ease somewhat: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" was on the way to leaving the port more than two months after the Iranian settlement and the recent release.
But the US announced that it would transfer defensive missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia as Iran ’ s arch-enemy, and fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom had, at times, driven oil prices up sharply in recent weeks.
Poking Trump
In the case of US President Donald Trump ’ s possible abuse of power, accusations of cover-ups against the White House have been made, with several senior officials making strenuous efforts to prevent access to the text of the meeting at the end of July, following a disputed phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj, a House of Representatives Democrat Nancy Pelosi, a White House Democrat, explicitly accusing the White House of a “witch-hunt. ”
North Korea Fears Trump and Kim ’ s Third Summit
North Korea has raised doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon culminate in a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The purpose and prospects for success of such a meeting are questionable, owing to lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The US has not yet done anything to implement last year's summit decisions, said the North Korean State Department adviser, criticizing the tightening of US sanctions and joint US and South Korean military exercises, but hoping for a "wise" and "brave" decision by Trump to restore rapprochement.
On Monday, Trump said that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before declaring his willingness to do so, and negotiations to disarm North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile programs have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February, when both met in June in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas they agreed to revive the talks, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers to help mine clearance

Pound under Pressure
British Pound Under Pressure
With interest rates falling soon, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt ’ s speculation that the Bank of England (BoE) will soon lower interest rates is attributable to sterling, with the UK ’ s currency reduced on Friday by up to 0.4% to $1.2269.
The announcement was made by central banker Michael Saunder, who raised a cut in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, because uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This is surprising, as Saunders was seen as a champion of tight monetary policy, said the broker Ricardo Evangelista of ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the strain on the economy caused by the Brexit hiccup, without indicating a direct cut in interest rates, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to leave the EU on 31 October if necessary, even without a divorce agreement.
Moreover, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian Manipulation
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's head of the World Federation of Athletics.
In January 2019, Moscow ’ s doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport was revealed, after which the Wada had closed the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years, during which time Russian athletes were not entirely banned from the world stage.
The Missing Positions
In the following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the trials in question.
"We received the data nine months ago and we should check whether the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in Friday's interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
The World Cup Not affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: the Association of Athletics is the only organisation to remain under the spell of Russia, and at the World Cup in Doha 30 Russian athletes are running under a neutral flag, having to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and are undergoing testing.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already launched manipulations and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks, and Russia is now threatening to ban the Rusada once again and, in the worst case, to ban the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
