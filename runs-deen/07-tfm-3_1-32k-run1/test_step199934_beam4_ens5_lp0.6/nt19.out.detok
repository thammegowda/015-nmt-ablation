The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared for a conversation with German trainer Joachim Löw and Team Manager Oliver Bierhoff.

The New York police and musician Chris Martin reassured people from the stage.

You are all in safety.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free on the Internet as every year.

Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends Rauswurf of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the smokescreen of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The Turkish journalist who lives in Hamburg had passed a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and went to the first row.
The T-shirt, was not the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has created a strong disquiet, which is unacceptable.
He has therefore led to the protection of people to leave the man.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of spying or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
Turkish leaders blame the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatening several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are not sure about the Turkish authorities: only in early September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of imprisoned journalists, Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had been disturbed.
They were free and could return to Germany, but there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
We have to look at twice: Yes, that is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talkshow "Inas Nacht" is produced by the NDR "is known for humid talks at the counter of the Hamburg Hafenkneipe" Schellfischposten ".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests on a number of beer, some wine, or even more high-percentage drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few promis also drink courage for compulsory singing.
On Friday, another episode of the popular Talkshow was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your judgement" or "The Secret Day".
The trip to the north was not good enough.
On Saturday he posted a Selfie - his face is completely crushed, the eyes only two small strokes.
The Bett-Selfie shows a completely outdated Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful cat.
To his fans he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights he has now gained: "Rule one: goes NIE goes to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black sau.
And injection.
And the round of Eierlikör, which smells the Ina around half three, also let away.
Alcohol consumption is literally written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat offspring.
They range from instant bridges, fish crumbs or, probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply amused the sight of the normally attractive cinema.
As Ina Müller has survived the night suction store, it is not known.
As she moderated the TV fun at the counter but already since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has Vandalism and Unrat
The entry into the 36 km long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly apparent.
Scherben, cigarette kippers, garbage and squeeze, demolished dustbin and now dismantled signboards - for a long time now, the entry with a seat group to the cycle path on the Haaße Hill in Treysa.
For the flagship project Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland, a more than an awful sight.
The topic occupies members of the ADFC group Schwalmstadt as well as others for a long time, as the.
The problem has already been raised in the cycling advisory board.
There has not been a solution yet.
The proposals range from the installation of the seat group to regular waste storage and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible further activities", says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that they have also brought the topic into the local advisory board.
Not only the rubbish drives cyclists and residents - the group is a regular meeting place at weekends.
It is not only often heard loud, but it is also destroyed: posts are torn out of the earth, dustbin demolished, shields around, seat furniture.
Volunteers have already cleared up more frequently, ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
You are annoying that the Rastplatz on the bicycle path in Treysa is a meeting point for saufcamps.
"Along the entire cycle path, there is a clear focus on the Haaße hill", the radar operator, who is now also concerned about the new radar station in goat hain, which is being opened today.
'If it makes the same fate, it will be very expensive '.
Another idea is a video surveillance at the hill: "Perhaps this will significantly increase the threshold of intervening in the community.
This would require, however, require a police force to pass quickly.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
It must be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycle path, you can be very satisfied.
The marketing of tourism is still able to develop.
Our cycling path is very high quality compared to others in Germany, "says ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no abbias on the Haaße hill.
In the case of traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow ", explains them.
This is not a problem for sportive drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest in the cultural station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake ".
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and co-existence.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of Hiltrup ", in the" Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians ".
A contest "with eyebrows in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family coexistence with coffee and cakes from the cultural station of honour.
Seven formations began, from the one-man band band to the great ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long albachtener, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not yet seen this in other parts of the city.
What were the texters associated with?
In the places the Hiltruper lake and the market allee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his hitting song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Time and again it was about the experience of co-existence in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short changes with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their work.
He learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
Franke knew about Tontechnician Stefan Schemmelmann that the recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all of them on Youtube.
"It is not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury ’ s favorites - so that others can hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechnician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer, who impressed Franke with his music, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children came up again for the final - and even sounded "right", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, intransigence of melody and recognition.
The jury belonged Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß von KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Business Verbund and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the district offensive.
The city ’ s offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She appreciated the event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game.
The players form two teams sitting opposite each other.
For each page there is a view screen, in which four cards with keywords that you can only decipher the old trick with the red slide.
This ensures that the other side can read nothing.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2.
3 dice.
4. Fest ".
These are the terms that must be encrypted.
For guess, it is not the terms but codes.
One player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card on which may be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto", not the terms behind the secret film but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should describe the terms "dice", "feast" and "windows" - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as possible; because that wins the game if he manages twice to crack the code.
So the encryptor notes and reads loud: "Werfen" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to festival; here would of course be something like "party" and "Prague" because he watched in school and knows the window.
This is how the round for round, team for team.
You do not know the terms of the opposite side - but you can better get together with any hint that the encryption gives there.
Perhaps mysterious but not turned out to be rotated, otherwise you will make it unnecessary for your team.
The most crypt to "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it quite long and detailed until they can finally play.
The explanation video on decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But anyone who has started to start will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this inconvenient game.
However, "Decrypto" is not as coherent as predecessors and Genre Primus "codenames", which is also an agent computer at a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only about rats and not winning points can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: man shows police Hitlergruß and harassed guests in the pub.

Pressig plant was home to the Schubloks of.
The railway station in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald forest for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers cut off buffers, one heard it in Pressig", remembers Georg Dinkel who archives the history of the place and the railway station.
That did not encourage anyone.
As quietly the brakes and screwed the wagons.
That was just railways.
Statements that are sensuous for Dinkels home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald forest was shaped by the railways.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-Bergstrecke to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 metres metres of altitude in Steinbach.
In order to cope with this, train and Schubloks were needed earlier, who had their homeland in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station with 21 locomotives, apprenticeship and railway master.
"The heart was the hub, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a renovation in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years.
The railway station Pressig (BW) Pressig (BW) Pressig (BW) Pressig (BW) Pressig (BW) Pressig (BW) (BW) Pressig (BW) and Kronach.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported by a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight ellics were stationed in Pressig.
Electrification of the 1939 line already minimized the need for train and Schubloks.
In 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 walls were ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were dismantled in 1991.
Heidrich: 'It is regrettable that we have not envisaged better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport'.
At Pfingsten in 1989, the Nuremberg railway director of Nuremberg celebrated the anniversary "50 years electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" a pompous Bahnin..
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," Georg Dinkel remembers.
Little later the end.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were deducted, the Pressig Rangier station was history.
"The rangiers and inhibitors performed the most difficult work in train traffic," reminds Dinkel.
Any misuse would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.

The series she became the star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 – 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I was born with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of me admired colleagues took me true on equal terms, "says Keller talks with the" picture on Sunday ".
She was always only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "traumatic ship".
For now, journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know it".
She considers it possible that her husband could have been envious, but "like many men also shy, Hans talks about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be the only right thing for Hans von Borsody and he wanted to get to know my fears about my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have adjusted myself "as she explains.
She always felt that "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, whom I never was in truth, even though I sometimes appeared freak and courageous on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever '.
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said Yes, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong again".
The day before the stand-by marriage, I sat in the garderobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never dressed with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined the love then "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I went far too naively to love '.

Will Aldi be Tinder 2.0?
Those who say that in times of Tinder there are no romantic tales of connoisseurs - should talk to Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast-food datings" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket looks like an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced put-meat, boxershort bargains at the desert table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The App Tinder is called to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We dared the test: how do women react, they are not long talking about the bush in the first news?
That is the astonishing result.
Hollywood-Lovestory-law potential is the case when the love fortune precedes an out-den-eye lost and resettled plot.
If the type is also reported at the bio-putenfleisch @ gmx.de at its address, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
The author of this Annonce, in an Aldi -Filiale, is very much to wish that she will find her mourning husband with whom she spoke about the "30% reduced organic meat".
She has certainly earned her Happy End à la Hollywood for believing in the magic of analogue connoisseurs., and.

Football: District League: Researchers appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrhein
There were moments in this still young season, as Alois Fetsch went hard to court with the ropes.

All history.
In the meantime it is running around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beleg is 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrhein, in the last game time only very thin at the ascent.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the appearance.
"We have made the rooms tightly and put pressure on the ball.

Wolbeck had much more games in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his end (17th), who switched Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the lead.
Almost that would have been shattered when the SCA in minute 41, the SCA appeared twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer was dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Kasten - Tormann Damian Hallas proved a master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Schroer came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entry.
With Miles Geske, Fetsch missed a hairdresser on the left side.
When the old rhein Chris Naberbäumer in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, 18 metres in front of the guest house there was an indirect release.
The jail took up himself and demonstrated its vulnerability to standards.
Westhues "Ding with the right snake struck at the bottom left from view of the shooter - 1: 0 (71.).
20 minutes that should be condemned long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew to his hand in the 80th minute.
Arbitration judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately showed the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Bange minutes of Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase before Geske had the victory in the 87th minute of twelve metres.
Would perhaps have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75.

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rarity at corporate boards.
Thus, only 8% of the boards on the date of 1 September were female, as stated in the report "The Power of Monoculture", officially presented on Monday by the Allbright Foundation and presented by the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise international competitors will pass over them," said Founding Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the US, the United Kingdom, or Sweden, purely male leadership teams, with a few exceptions, are far from conceivable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It is another corporate culture.
The slight increase in women ’ s share among German stock companies is due solely to positive impulses in the companies of the index of Central Values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was 3.8%.
In the 30 Dax companies - in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Finally, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that next year's Dax companies will recruit more consistent women - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit to increasing the share of zero zero.
Another picture is that of the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Recruitment equal number of women per year for the boards, would have reached 40% in 2023," says the report.

VW core brand is missing: Parisian automobile salon in the light of the Diesel Debate
The Paris automobile salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue, yet omnipresent: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting bans and retrofitting equipment will not let German car companies get off at the Paris industry meeting.
At the 2018 automobile salon, they will show their innovations from next week, together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
Diesel really does not play a major role in this.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, but should still be an important issue at least behind the shining scenes of the exhibition stands.
A large name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there, among other things, their first pure electric models: the e-tron of Ingolstadt will come onto the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.

It is feared that the number of victims will still be clearly high.
So far, the figures are only from Palu.
Many other municipalities are affected - along Sulawesis west coast.
Approximately 150 bikers are celebrating worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final gothic service for motorcyclists in the peace church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the peace church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.

In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group made of Gummersbach.
The preaching held parish Dirk Grzegorek during the Biker Service Service.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill was responsible for the musical underscore.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill proposes more poetic-quiet sounds," says parish Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle gothic service.
Homer Association celebrates great feast: after the apple, milk comes from the apple.
And also during the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple cakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his astonishing viewers step by step the process from mature apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the great funeral.
With a little muscle force, the apples became a fine crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how to become a tasty drink.
However, they were also able to look at this late Friday afternoon.
In forms packed and covered by networks, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the pane of the apple piece that looks a little like sucksell-looking apple piece.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice went gradually into a large vessel.
But the farmer farmer had already completed specialties.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented to the older visitors the latest spring white.
The demand for the good drop "Made in foil" was correspondingly big.
In a cosy atmosphere, parents came into conversation, while children were not only able to follow the process of the apple press, but also discovered the built Hüpfburg castle for themselves..,.,.,.....,.
Activities of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited at some stations for short-time games.
Next year, the home club will offer an action day.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out, it will not be the home house in the heart of the savings fund.

1: 4 versus Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season bankruptcy: "Beschissene Situation" "
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in successive coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointment professionals of Hannover 96 to stand up for themselves and expressed courage.
There were lots of positive things before the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt.

It was the first Bundesligatreffer for the defensive players who took part in the summer.
And Frankfurt continued before the break.
This time, Haller adapted to his Stormpartner Rebic, who was skilfully crafted and 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser.
In the half-time Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak vision of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a little more courageous forward, but ignominious ideas remained until the end of the day, when the connector was still successful.
The witches were much more efficient.
After an hour, Rebic started a solo solo and then put across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into empty gate.
The rest was only a show run for the Frankfurt against unwanted guests, even Jovic met one minute before the end.

Donau-Iller ’ s life aid opens a new home for people with disabilities at Münsterblick Street.
The fact that in the Münsterblick road "a very special house" will be handed over to its provision - there were all agreed at the time of arrival.

Wide corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the US Army ’ s former US Army officer was put to the test bench for the residents with Handycap: "The house had come to the years and no longer in the equipment," Bader explained retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators went to demolish the house.
The new construction should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel at ease, the architect.

Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, Deputy Chairman of the SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantages of East Germany.
There are differences that, after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, 'said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern said the' Day miracle on Sunday '.
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East German worked longer on average than people in West Germany, but 15% less salary.
"I cannot explain to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this putty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan Jagdhund is intended to smooth the gap between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungsan Jagdhunde.
As Moon ’ s office told Sunday, the two dogs reached about one year old dogs already reached their recipients on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border place of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feeding to facilitate the animals.
The dogs with the thick white coat, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced its friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
In doing so, both countries agreed to join international sporting competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to join together for the Olympic Games in 2032.

Austria ’ s Moved History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemoration year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, which answer this question mostly in retrospect over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive, presents in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New Week, New Chance for the Government
Returning to material work - this is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition ’ s working week.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and CSU have not recently summoned the "return to the material work".
This may have led to some craftsmen, doctors, cassetters and other working citizens in that country have led to the legitimate question, what is the difference between work and work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is ready to return to its mandate - governance - it should not be discouraged from talking about terms.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and blasphemy of recent weeks will probably be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties come together to the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, the question of diesel retrofitting and the specialist immigration law are once again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to allow car companies to get away with exchange-premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to retrofit older diesel.
While there has been a rapprochement over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned specialist immigration law.
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the 'track change' from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners, and how should it be different?
Not just and the same thing has joined GroKo, but three partners with very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society characterized by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be raised again for party tactical reasons.
We are still talking about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD are supposed to fight - but always look at the real life of the people..,,,..,., and.,.
What is feasible and benefits many?
With this key issue, both diesel and track change can be pragmatically clarified - and thus regain confidence.
That is what the people ’ s parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in Visier
Is the Minister of Labour against current services law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at this.
"Really day and night" their legists had worked on social security reform, a superfluous social minister reported when presenting the same same two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is amazed - she brings the matter to Parliament via request.
They assume that 'the Minister only expressed their enthusiasm about the use of their team and in no way proclaiming infringements of existing service law in front of cameras'.
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to release har ­ tinger ".
Police Closes a Street in search of women's light
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to speak about this.
There is now confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning morning, there has been excavated on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed in Marxgrün until Monday.
Previously, the investigators had previously used an archeology.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his leader, could finally limit the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, a floor anomaly was discovered in collaboration with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Monument Protection Agency in the area of this road.
For more than a year, Public Prosecutor and Criminal Police Court have been working on the grounds of failure.
Marxgrün, a bicycle path was closed and investigated with sonar equipment, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been blocked in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is the first time.
But before there are riots.
The separatists did not forget the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, there has been clashes between separatists and the police.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, using color powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 officials from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police forces wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who were used last year in the polling local elections.
At the time, violence had also occurred when trying to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep separating the demonstrations of separatists and the central state security forces, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the 6000 separatists would then have tried to break the police chain and, among other things, using colour bags and eggs.
Six people had been arrested, 24 others were easily injured, and they were called upon by the authorities.
On Monday, the first anniversary of the referendum on independence.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid forced Catalonia in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont flew into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also resigned abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement continue to be held in U-detention.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan Government took office in May, the forced administration to end.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the 'right to self-determination' of Catalans.
Football: North League Westfalen: Conflict Ratelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen are torlos separate torlos.,,.
Red White Ahlen continues on the spot.
The FC Gütersloh was only a 0: 0.
The final light and the third last showed them in front of 438 viewers in the Heidewaldstadion.
The first half was manageable by the entertainment factor.
If you would prefer to get a beer or a bratwurst, you could do this without worry.
There was no danger of missing torchance, because there was virtually no one.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) blast Nick Flock.
The best - and in principle only true - was the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG Torwart Frederic Westergerling Frederic Westergerling, after 32 minutes with a shot from the ceiling.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action consisted of early change.
Storm Lars Schröder had to be exchanged for injuries, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel reached about the housing and after one hour, the freight slots were also proactive for the first time.
After a conquest of Matthäus Wieckowicz, it went fix.
The swiftly presented conter about Sinan Aygün "Nick Flock (62nd) with a soft shot in the arm of RWA Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they had a headball of Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interimstrainer Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian mothers (70).
It did nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to his own initiative, the Ahlener did not achieve anything.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did it.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero was on the front.
"We were not as tordangerously as we were against Wood wickede and that although our opponent had no desire to play here", RW Ahlens Interimstrainer.
Offensively "everything advocated a bit" against a team that only wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not feel that we could get a counter-gate ', so thumb.
However, as a spectator did not feel that his team could shoot a gateway.
The idea was too poor.
Reckenfelder Erntedank Market: Fortunately, there are enough chalmers in Switzerland.
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Control Center for which these donations are intended.
The official assurances: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening of the sky was bright blue, while the room was slightly empty, but that should change over the day.
For: "Here it is so beautiful social, so we are here today," said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in Kiepenkerl-outfit as always with a decent prise humor.
For the couple of Brockmann, who was supposed to be weighed against food, jumped up Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there is enough chalmers.
And the "replacement" could not be taken to entertain the ever-increasing audience.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at late hour.
"Simply great", Marcel Kreimer was happy.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many active players with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"In fact, there should be something like a tablet," he thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stalls and also included the next festivals and the Clean up action.
Our garden town offers a colourful paint - here what goes.
Then the Maikranz of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klpiece was taken away with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarter.
Many stalls have been worked for the good.
From sweet to heart, everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has lived in Reckenfeld for a year, has been creative at his decupier bar.
Furniwork, beer lid with reckenfelder motifs and a lot more he had in offer.
A speciality offered three Reckenfelder Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", accompanied by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter still has a speciality.
Honey cakes in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Here the little Elsa had to access again and again, so good the cake.
The sociability is that the visitors then stayed long until the evening hours, even without a stage programme that is not available at the Autumn Festival.
Blacksmithing with local embassy: No successful advertising for skateboarding equipment
In Lengerich, unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate plant in Lengerich.
In several places, there are corresponding lubricants, Jürgen Kohne of the City Administration on request from the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been imposed on the police.
The three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" in large letters on signs, among other things, the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that an appropriate font had been discovered at the entrance of the Gempt-Bistro on 19 September.
Since the short message appears to have been "left with an Edding, they have been able to be removed easily.
"Just a few days later, this was blown up again," says Rottmann.
It assumes that the appropriate advertising shield must be replaced.
A special note gets this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the table.
If the skatepark is built, the project will be made possible by sponsors.
Jörg Hesselmann has already made promises, from the urban field of school, sport and culture.
Well possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the covered table.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the issue of skateboarding.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began.
The majority of the Council spoke out in favour of the fire-fighting park.
However, it was not implemented - too many factors seem to have spoken against building here.
At the end of June, a U-turn followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is then the City Council.
It is starting from a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Bad air traffic control gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm," said the head of the trade union of air traffic control, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known human resources problem in European air safety, for which there is no rapid solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Across Europe, the market for ready-trained pilots is empty.
Some hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe for monitoring the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic City, representatives of the federal, the countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional workload and overtime, this will not go without us," the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German Air Safety Insurance.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for pilotage misery.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period that runs until 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings in national air traffic control are now fully integrated into operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that do not clean air traffic control.
At present, EU standards would be voted by 2024 and there would be further tightened up.
The EU is subject to constant pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now reap exactly what they have sowed in recent years," Maas said.
He hope that the high delays in airlines will take a rethink.
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", Maas said.
The record of 120 piloters per year over the next five years is sufficient to compensate for the age-related outages.
The necessary personnel building is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Consolidated Consolidated
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp-Interimschef Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies should be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in personnel than the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is intended to include 50% share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business of elevators and suppliers will be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence in demos of police and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence activists in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with many injuries.
According to the municipal administration, approximately 3,000 police officers from all over Spain, as well as about 6000 people were demonstrating.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests from one another.
However, according to the forces of independence tried repeatedly to break the safety barrier.
They would have attacked officials with colour and slippers.
According to the figures, there were also among the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
The police informed that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and honouring colleagues
In their demonstration, the police had wanted to pay tribute to those colleagues who took action against the referendum of independence in Catalonia, almost a year ago, banned.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Families of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators found it a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona in particular.
"Why did they come here to protest?", the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez asked the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they left us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only do their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is in favour of enforcing our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues did not come to provoke ", the policeman assured.

Real Madrid ’ s Torhunters first led to the former Bundesliga professional, Mario Mandzukic, who led with a double pack (26th / 49).

So Süverkrüp slips into improvisations, from Bachs's "O Haupt full blood and wounds" into the "song of death", and from Mozart g-Moll-Symphony into a playful danzchen.
There were great applause and Bravo from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.

He led the many visitors with an illustration by the long history of the circle association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came from the garden, for the winter it was caught.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the user garden turned into a decorative garden.
"Nature has existed, it was before us and we have to orient it," the expert for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for the garden growers not to let our homeland remain beautiful and life-value.
It also includes welcoming the new citizens in our clubs, the President of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the turbo stores of the music association Thurnau.

Trump cries Kim: 'And then we got in love'
It is no secret that US President Kim ’ s leader, despite the nuclear crisis, is no secret.
Now, however, Trump has made a real statement of love to his colleague.
This also has to do with Kims' beautiful letters'.
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become a new flame.
The tragedy: It is a distance relationship.

"I was tough, he also, and between us," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
Not only talks with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote to me beautiful letters, it were great letters.
Their personal relationship has also borne fruit politically: Trump referred to the halt of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have little more than lip service.
Trump ’ s nickname for Kim, seems to be well aware of the fact that his martial threat to Kim ’ s infamous Rocket Man, is unlikely to be obsessed by the US president.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of his performance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How terrible is that?
That is so unpretentious.
But he did not take care of this, explained Trump, and put his finger on the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so simple to be presidial".
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there into this stubborn arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.

The group had shot the reception in her cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he brought himself into danger of life.
One of his fellow fighters was almost to death by the guardians, Onyeka said.
Generally, the conditions of detention have been catastrophic: 'They have all proposed us with pipes and sticks'.
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the Latrine.
The IOM organizes voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homes this year through the program, IOM said in West Africa, Jorge Galindo.
The case of Nigerians now rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
But he has not heard of a help per mobile video.
International organizations have long criticised the conditions in Libya ’ s refugee camps as inhumane.

Let the Rule of Law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own claims of rule of law in.
The relations between the two countries are currently overshadowed, "Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This particularly concerns waves of arrests, press freedom and freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan 'that if relations are to normalise relations in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important precondition for this'.
Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan stressed once again the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been transferred to a building of the Federal Defense Ministry at Cologne Airport in the short term.
Originally, it had to take place at Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected Erdogan from political conviction.
Erdogan traveled further to the opening of the Ditib-mosque in Cologne.

Failure in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump does not tire to stress the success of the negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea ’ s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, accused the US government in the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
"The recent deadlock is therefore that the US is building on coercive measures that are lethal for confidence building," said Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no way for us to disarm ourselves as the first," the North Korean chief diplomat.
That punitive measures could force North Korea to 'knees' is a pipe dream of people who do not know us'.
To build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test plant, Ri pointed out.
The US side, however, did not have 'corresponding reactions', but the Minister criticised.
Last year alone, owing to North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council had adopted three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have insisted on strict compliance with sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US administration is working towards rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea ’ s leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first Singapore summit, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is to return to Pyongyang talks about ending North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons program.

The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of HoT.
Our refrigerators were filled with food and ingredients before the summer break.

"We had to start from scratch again: although we received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so everyone wrapped up.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"It is not better able to cook", praised a visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests to serve Quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It is really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said parish Frank Beckmann, while wizards stephan lamms with card tricks and other pieces of art.

No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport was closed at Palu.
What is the situation on the island?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be used.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which have been completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have set up something provisionally where other people have accommodated.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are stretched to surrounding hills, which still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some remain in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many food stores and petrol stations are completely closed, people are picking food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down, the national government is helping.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partly free and finding them difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and missing.
How does the communication and supply of information on the island?
At the moment we have handswamp, but before that did not work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people from whom they do not know whether they live and where they are living, because people were travelling during the earthquakes were not at home, but for example..,.,. and....
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came..
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami meets the region and they are stretched to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi located on the Pacific Fire ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuation.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake hit a large number of people.

With a lot of gesture, solid figures and one or another joke, he brings closer to one of the most conflictual themes: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses to answer the question of a metaphor.
Germany ’ s society, at a table, the first generation migrants at a table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
That leads to conflict.
The decisive factor is not, therefore, whether political or the left, but 'Bin I for or against an open society?' he stresses.
At the beginning, the discussion is getting started.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is on stage, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is on an equal footing.
Sociology professor does not push his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of average, not individual destiny.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because 'only when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions, "says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing hour, he was still an open ear for the questions of guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities.

Austria ’ s industry has accelerated its downturn compared to the eurozone in August.
The purchasing manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month low.
However, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, announced the Markit Institute on Monday to its survey of 3,000 companies.

Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France, and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March.

The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
