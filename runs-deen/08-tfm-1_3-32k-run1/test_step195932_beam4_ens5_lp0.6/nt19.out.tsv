The T-shirt , was not the problem , said Seibert the picture on Sunday .	-2.4272
It was a disorder of the press conference .	-3.6487
The campaign by the journalist has caused a great deal of unrest , which is unacceptable .	-5.5895
He has therefore led people to bring the man out .	-5.5857
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery .	-3.0006
This applies completely regardless of whether or not this is a legitimate concern .	-4.0092
The rules are the rules .	-0.7878

Munich : Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller	-2.0803
So fresh and good , his fans usually know him : Florian David Fitz .	-3.3797

However , the trip to the north of Munich was not good at all .	-5.6198
On Saturday he postulated a Selfie - his face is completely shattered , the eyes only two small slits .	-6.4319
The Bett-Selfie shows a completely excited Florian David Fitz .	-3.7841
But he is not sick , he has only a powerful cater .	-3.1227
He postulated to his fans some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained : " Rule one : goes NIE to Inas night .	-6.1189
Rule two : never drink the black sau .	-1.6498
And syringe .	-1.1356
And the round of Eierlikör , which melts around half three , also leaves away .	-4.4395
Alcohol consumption is truly written into the face of the 43-year-old .	-4.1931
His fans posted a few tips to fight the offspring .	-4.7061
They were enriched by instant breasts , fish crumbs , or - probably the most targeted - headache pills .	-6.8584
Other amusing people simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema .	-6.0052
As Ina Müller has survived the nocturnal suction bearing , it is not known .	-6.3001
Since they have been moderating the TV fun on the counter since 2007 , the 53-year-old seems to be clearly tried out ...	-6.0666
On a beer with Ina Müller .	-1.6484
Treysa has to contend with vandalism and betrayal	-3.2718
The entry into Treysa ’ s 36-kilometre cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired .	-6.6915
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought , but solutions are hardly emerging .	-3.1830
Scherben , Zigarettenkippen , Müll und Unrat , demolierte Mülleimer und mittlerweile demontierte Hinweisschilder - so präsentiert sich seit Längerem der Einstieg mit Sitzgruppe zum Radweg auf dem Haaße-Hügel in Treysa .	-3.6798
For the flagship project Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland , a more than unbelievable sight .	-5.6561
The topic concerns members of the ADFC district group Schwalmstadt as well as others for longer , so the radar representative of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen .	-7.4981
The problem has already been raised in the Radverkehrsbeirat .	-3.2147
There has not been a solution .	-5.6995
The proposals range from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of waste containers and cleaning of the land at the entry point .	-7.7734
" I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible other activities " , says Wüstenhagen .	-4.3450
Guido Hahn ( ADFC ) reports that the issue has also been brought to the local advisory board .	-4.2967
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place at weekends .	-4.7738
It is not only common to say that gelagen is destroyed : upwards from the earth , dustbin demolished , shielded , seat furniture smelled .	-9.7137
Volunteers had already been cleaned up more frequently , ADFC member Susanne Klippert tells .	-4.7620
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean .	-3.1363
You are annoyed that the Rastplatz on the bike path is a meeting place for suction bearings .	-7.4785
" Along the entire cycle path there is a clear focus on the Haaße hill , " the Radverkehrsbeauftragte , who is now also responsible for the new wheelchair in Ziegenhain , which is being opened today .	-8.0913
" If she relies on the same fate , it will be quite expensive " .	-5.1156
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill : " Perhaps the threshold is much higher to interfere with common good .	-5.4932
That would , however , presuppose that a police strike should be brought forward in a timely manner .	-6.9886
In principle , Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the Haaße-Hügel .	-3.4243
It must be made more attractive .	-1.3198
In fact , the frequency of the cycle path can be very satisfied .	-5.2191
Tourism marketing is still eligible for development .	-4.5086
Our cycling path is very high quality compared to others in Germany , so the ADmembers . are . and are and , , , , and , , , , ,	-9.2664
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa as a highly critical danger point .	-5.3183
There is no Abbiegespur on the Haaße hill .	-3.8234
In the case of traffic it may happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of traffic " , she explains .	-6.1289
This is not a problem for sporty drivers , but for older people and especially for children .	-4.0588
Music Contest in the Kulturbahnhof : Die " Kö von Hiltrup " und der See	-2.8921
The first call to the music contest was a success , creative and collaborative .	-2.7007
" D a song for Hiltrup " is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup , in the " music contest for large and small young and experienced musicians " .	-4.2304
As Karl Franke put it , a contest " with eye-cokers in the sympathetic Hiltruper family " .	-6.1653
In fact , it was soon a family coexistence with coffee and cake from the honorary official of the Kulturbahnhofs .	-4.8382
Seven formations took place , from the Ein-Mann-Band to the big ensemble : Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied , Henk Humberg with guitar , Rolf Ihmig , a long Albachtener in Hiltrup , the Nine from the Hiltruper Sternfarben , three members and three generations of families Trenkamp and Claus , an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties .	-5.3459
This contest , as the mayor Joachim Schmidt declared , is a novelty .	-4.5247
We have not seen that in other parts of the city .	-2.7603
What were the textures associated with ?	-3.8877
The Hiltruper lake and the market alley were mentioned in the places .	-6.4837
Rolf Ihmig arbitrated the avenue in his beating song to " Kö von Hiltrup " .	-3.7781
The cultural station was also appreciated .	-3.3848
Time and again , it was a question of the experience of coexistence in these places , especially in Alvin Jasic .	-6.1814
Karl Franke revived the short upheavals with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their work .	-5.1865
For example , Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry , but now also taught guitar .	-4.4262
From Tontechniker Stefan Schemmelmann , Franke knew that the recent arrival in Ludwigshafen took place at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest .	-5.8785
And Alvin Jasic , meanwhile , has placed everything on Youtube .	-3.6208
" It is not about winning , " Franke said .	-2.7459
In fact , all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy .	-2.7573
However , there was something special for the jury 's favorites - so that others can listen to their songs .	-4.9599
An entire CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann .	-2.5471
Other musicians can record a song : Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager , who impressed Franke especially with his musicality , and the " Lummerland-Rudel " : " a very nice performance " with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon , Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle .	-5.2923
Like everyone , the children came up again for the final - and even without electronic support - ' good ' , as Franke said .	-6.8304
The jury was guided by the aspects originality , relation to Hiltrup , intangibility of the melody and recognition value .	-4.4539
The jury attended Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik , Andreas Klomfaß vom KvG-Gymnasium und Oliver Ahlers vom Wirtschaftsverbund sowie Jan Kaven , Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive .	-3.5774
The city part offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary .	-5.2934
She valued the event as a full success .	-3.3189
All are " very satisfied " , and " the atmosphere was good " in the soon very full cultural station .	-3.4488
The word game : " Decrypto " in the game .	-4.7924
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other .	-3.9520
For each page there is a screen , in which four cards with keywords you - the old trick with the red slide - can only be deciphered when you have inserted them .	-7.0253
This ensures that the opposite side can not read anything .	-4.7775
On the cards , for example , you can read from left to right : " 1st Renaissance .	-4.2727
2 . Window .	-1.6541
3 .	-1.2960
4 . Festival .	-3.9816
These are the terms that need to be encrypted .	-3.1668
For guessing should not be the terms here , but codes .	-3.8849
Switching one player per team is the encryption .	-4.2779
He gets a code card which may be " 3.4.2 " .	-3.8368

His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms " cube " , " feast " and " window " - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and that the opposing team does not as much as possible ; because that wins the game if it succeeds twice in cracking the code .	-7.9608

Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the " Traumschiff " made Heide Keller ( 76 ) famous , but on January 1 , 2018 she went on board forever .	-4.1686

The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical underscore .	-4.8567
" Although the bikers prefer the blues rock , Valerie Lill proposes rather poetic-quiet tones " , says Frank Schröder .	-6.2621
This , too , was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle god service yesterday .	-4.3345
Folk orfer Heimatverein celebrates great festivities : After the apple comes milk .	-5.3599
Borisch was also active during the day of action .	-4.1814
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes .	-3.3195
Great interest also aroused Georg Hartmann Niemerg .	-2.3191
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his astonishing spectators step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice .	-9.7595
Then and when did Hartmann Niemerg leave the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel .	-3.5485
With a little muscle power , a fine crushed mass was removed from the apples .	-4.7132
Not many of the children could yet imagine how to become a tasty drink .	-5.1757
But they were also able to look at this late Friday afternoon .	-4.0582
In forms packed and wrapped by nets , Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacks a little like hackselgut looking apple pieces for layer .	-6.2069
Thanks to some technical support , the last step was no longer so difficult .	-3.5975
The freshly pressed juice ran after and after into a large vessel .	-5.3731
However , the farmer had already completed completed specialties .	-4.7878
He opened his " treasure chest " and presented the latest spring white to older visitors .	-4.2490
The demand for the good drop " Made in Füchtorf " was correspondingly large .	-3.1104
In a cosy atmosphere , the parents met , while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press , but also the built Hüpfburg for themselves .	-7.2696
Also active members of the observation team of former soldiers committed themselves within the framework of the festival and invited them to play short games at some stations .	-7.9266
Also next year , the Heimatverein will offer an action day .	-4.8984
But then , as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized , the home house will not be in the heart of the Savings Bank of the Place of Action .	-5.6645
Instead , a farm will be visited .	-2.0423
This is also obvious on the basis of the subject : after all , there will be some milk .	-5.4205
1 : 4 against Frankfurt : Hanover with fourth season bankrupt : " Beschissene Situation "	-2.6987
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat after each other , coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointing profits from Hanover 96 and spoke to them courage .	-5.3526
A lot of positive things were done before at 1 : 4 ( 0 : 2 ) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt , however .	-8.8258
" It 's a divorce situation , but you have to smoke as a team , " said 96-soccer profile Pirmin Schwegler and shocked : " Of course this is disappointing because you always take a lot ahead " .	-7.7122
The more vicious Lower Saxony , for which only Florent Muslija ( 86 ) came to an end , are down with two meters and are a descent candidate in their current constitution .	-6.9943
On the other hand , the first-ever Saison-Heimsieg celebrated by . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.8239
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute , Rebic ( 45th + 1 ) , Jonathan de Guzmán ( 59th ) and Luka Jovic ( 89th ) achieved the goals of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner , who proposed the European League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table after the successful general test .	-10.1703
Croatia ’ s vice-champion Rebic was almost involved in any dangerous offensive of the armies at his start debut and never got to grips with Hannovers ’ defense .	-6.4985
The long troubled storms following the World Cup showed at its speed and perseverance why it is so valuable for harmony .	-6.1761
In addition to Rebic , the Brazilian Allan , who was born from the FC Liverpool , was the first time in the early formation of Frankfurt , which began to flourish .	-8.8670
One of Lucas Torró ’ s headball counterfeited on the Torró Torró Tor network ( 17 ) was at risk for the first time .	-8.6579
Six minutes later , Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense against the Brazilian Felipe , who replaced the short-run Kevin Wimmer ( back ) .	-5.1084
Leadership for the Hausherren fell almost inevitable and entirely deserved .	-5.3568
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defensive corner in the penal room , an indoor prolonged by head to the gate where Ndicka only needed to keep the foot .	-7.2932
It was the first Bundesliga meeting in the summer of the French two-league player AJ Auxerre .	-5.0526
And Frankfurt continued before the break .	-3.1677
This time Haller adapted to his Sturmpartner Rebic , who skilfully danced and 96-Torwart Michael Esser left no chance .	-7.4986
In the mid-term , Hannover-Coach reacted to the weak idea of his elf and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt .	-4.4835
The Lower Saxony , though somewhat bolder , played forward , but sparked ideas remained until the end , when the follow-up was still successful .	-9.5750
The heels were much more efficient .	-2.8810
After a short hour , Rebic started a solo and then pushed across De Guzmán , who had to push the ball to the empty gate .	-6.5081
The rest was only a show for the Frankfurt guests , even Jovic met one minute before the end .	-5.7685
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile .	-3.1491
In spite of cool temperatures , there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre .	-5.6654
The Munich Lord Mayor Dieter Reiter managed to open the 185 millionth public at the opening .	-5.4558

Geising : Geisinger Christians celebrate Heilig-Kreuz-Fest	-3.1435
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Heilig-Kreuz-Fest on September 14 or on Sunday afterwards .	-3.2107
The Festgottesdienst takes place in the city church , then a procession to the Heilig-Kreuz-Kirche with the closing .	-5.6170
The Holy Cross Church houses the stormed Christ , which dates from the 30-year-old war and which the legend is to have shot after a Swedish soldier .	-6.4703
Then blood flowed out of the firing .	-4.6868
This resulted in a large pilgrimage to the shifted Christ , which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church .	-6.1531
This is not finished to date , only the altar room is standing , the missing Langhaus is indicated by the trees .	-7.7439
In his preaching , Pfarrer Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope , comfort and life .	-2.9565
The service of worship was badly visited despite the importance of the Geisinger parish .	-4.9347
After the worship , the procession took place to the Holy Cross Church and ended with the final blessing of the church part of the Cross .	-5.4145
For many years the Catholic Church choir has been inviting the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish .	-4.9147
The choral members served the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and the weather adjusted , farm eggs .	-6.1670
In the afternoon , the parish church still offered guided tours around the city church , Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid Seger , on behalf of the parish community , informed visitors about the damage to facade , roof , sandstone work and windows , as well as the upcoming construction measures , which will take place until next year .	-6.7204
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time , the damage could be detected more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more specifically .	-7.0211
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned , because the damage that has already been done a few years ago has increased , but more has also been found , which was only possible through the injection by means of scaffolding .	-8.8529
The socket plaster works are completed before the winter is still to be started with the natural stone works and you still hope to be able to complete half of this work this year .	-7.8495
Einweihung : Neues Wohnheim in der Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße	-2.4587
The life aid of Donau-Iller opens a new home for disabled people in the Münsterblickstraße .	-3.4999
The fact that in the Münsterblick street now " a very special house " will be handed over to its destination - there were all present at the inauguration date .	-7.9420
After all , the 12 wheelchair users who have been living in Donau-Iller ’ s home have for some time been relying on the special architecture of the new building .	-5.8618
Wider corridors , corridors and doors , larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas has taken into account architect Rudolf Bader in his concept .	-4.2241
The first plans began around eight years ago , when the US Army ’ s former officer building was tested for the residents of Handycap : " The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in the equipment " , said Bader retrospectively .	-7.5977
In 2016 , the excavators receded to tear the house .	-4.5079
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it , so the architect .	-5.8547
Donau-Iller 's Life Aid opens a new home .	-3.2833
Around EUR 4.6 million has invested life aid in new construction .	-4.5652
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million , the district of Schwaben EUR 450000 .	-2.7654
According to the architect Bader , the construction works remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms .	-5.5423
He also thanked the Managing Director of Life Aid , Jürgen Heinz .	-3.6619
The spagate between a barrier-free and at the same time moist-resistant construction has not always been easy .	-5.4561
However , the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to enjoy the freedom to move around without foreign help .	-7.8824
Similarly , the head of the social administration of the district Schwaben , Gertrud Kreutmayer , said : " The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants who need tools to be mobile " .	-5.6037
In doing so , the viability and functionality were well combined , said Kreutmayer .	-5.3259
And again : " The land in this situation is a real happiness because it is no longer possible to acquire it in today 's situation " .	-6.7545
Altogether , the new home in the Münsterblick street offers space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three groups .	-5.7961
We are proud to be Managing Director Heinz on the eleven full-time workers all employed by collective bargaining .	-6.7887
Germany : Schwesig beklagt Differences between East and West	-2.1839
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity , the Deputy Chairman of the SPD , Manuela Schwesig , appealed to all compatriots not to be deprived of East Germany .	-5.3415
There are differences that pains unity after almost 30 years .	-2.8353
We must not be satisfied with these differences , " said Prime Minister Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , on Sunday .	-4.4871
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country .	-2.7002
It is unacceptable for East Germany , on average , to work longer than the people of West Germany , but to receive 15 % less salary . , , , , , , , , and .	-6.2646
" I cannot explain this almost 30 years after German unity , " said Schwesig .	-4.1597
North Korea : Does this putative dog end the Korean conflict ?	-3.7935
The one-year Pungsan Jagdhund is supposed to smooth the gulf between the two Koreas .	-5.0218
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul , Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan Jagdhunde a gift .	-3.6818
As Moons ’ office announced on Sunday , the two dogs about a year old reached their recipients on Thursday .	-5.3189
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the ' reconciliation of animals ' .	-4.9948
The dogs with the thick white coat , pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent .	-3.0224
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .	-2.1997
The friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September .	-3.9657
Both countries also agreed to join forces in international sporting competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to join forces to host the 2032 Olympic Games .	-4.8264
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile drives following mutual rapprochement .	-3.3970
Austria ’ s History in the Mirror of 99 Documents	-2.5810
What is Austria ?	-0.4339
At the 100th anniversary of the Republic , which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of commemoration , numerous new books have been published , most of which answer this question in retrospect over the past hundred years .	-6.3552
Wolfgang Maderthaner , historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive , sets out in the magnificent " Bilderbuch " Austria , which will appear on 1 October .	-5.4329
New Week , New Opportunity for the Government	-1.7458
Back to work on the subject - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition that is now beginning .	-6.4588
Hardly any interview , hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and their ministers from CDU , SPD and CSU have recently summoned the ' return to work on the subject ' .	-7.6198
This may have led some craftsmen , doctors , cashier and other working citizens in that country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and work , but be it .	-7.3576
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its mandate - governance - it should not now be prevented from discussing concepts .	-6.8467
Whether , after the provocations and blames of recent weeks , the Union and the SPD will , in fact , be able to achieve something together will probably be shown on Monday .	-8.2207
In the evening , the leaders of the governing parties come together to the coalition committee .	-4.0424
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early ; a lesson from all the dispute .	-3.5822
First of all , however , there are again conflicting issues on the agenda with diesel upgrades and the law on skilled immigration .	-6.7914
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to give car companies with exchange-rate premiums glimpflich dawn , SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to upgrade older diesel .	-9.0393
As a result of the diesel crisis over the weekend , the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned legislation on specialist migration .	-7.2639
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or make training .	-3.9567
The Union is strongly opposed to the ' change of track ' from the asylum system to the labour market .	-3.2969
So there will again be disputes among coalition partners - and how should it be otherwise ?	-4.3121
Not the same thing and the same has joined forces with GroKo , but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities .	-5.7361
Disputes are good .	-2.1077
Without a dispute , society , sometimes characterised by contradictory interests , is not making progress .	-5.6590
In order to be constructive , however , disputes must not be raised again for partisan reasons on the question of being or being .	-5.6883
It is still a question of politics , not of theatre .	-3.4414
Union and SPD should argue - but always look at the reality of people 's lives .	-4.8557
What is feasible and useful to many ?	-1.8618
With this key issue , both diesel and track change can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence .	-5.0481
Above all , the parties must now fight .	-4.0491
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger	-1.8830
Minister in Visier	-2.5319
Does the Minister for Labour not violate the current law of service ?	-4.9544
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this .	-2.4427
" Really day and night " their legalists worked on the social security reform , reported a superficial social minister in the presentation of the same two weeks ago .	-6.8143
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger , the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein ( FPÖ ) arouses surprise - it brings the matter to Parliament via question .	-4.9139
She assumes that " the minister only expressed her enthusiasm for the use of her team and did not want to announce any violations of applicable law in front of running cameras " .	-7.8635
Nevertheless , they now have questions to be able to release Har ­ tinger from any suspicion ' .	-4.5857
Police rides on a street in search of women 's light	-7.4863
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to speak .	-3.6435
Now there is confirmation .	-1.8908
Since early Saturday morning , the road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug .	-3.3661
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday .	-3.3206
It was anticipated that the investigators had previously set up an archaeologist .	-5.6879
The dog , specially trained for the smell of old human nodules , was finally able , together with his leader , to limit the relevant place to a few meters .	-7.4971
In addition , a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the supreme Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the said road piece .	-5.5227
For more than a year now , the Public Prosecutor and the Criminal Police Court have been abusing the case .	-6.1534
At Marxgrün , a cycle path has been blocked and investigated with sonars because the investigators suspect that during the reconstruction of the state road 30 years ago Heike 's body could have been stuck .	-7.8004
Colorpowder and Eier : Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia ’ s anniversary	-3.7318
On Monday , the controversial referendum on independence in Catalonia marks the first time .	-3.2673
But there are already riots .	-5.3610
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the autumn of 2017 .	-3.0830
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017 , clashes between separatists and the police came in the centre of Barcelona .	-3.3072
Catalan security forces were attacked , among other things , by those who advocate independence , by using colour powders to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of national police and civilian guard .	-6.7960
Some 3,000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police forces wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who were in use last year in the polling stations ' referendum that was deemed illegal .	-7.1502
In trying to prevent citizens from voting , violence had also occurred at that time .	-5.1311
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central state security forces separate , reported Spanish media .	-3.7237
Some of the around 6000 separatists would then have attempted to break the police chain by force , and the officials , among other things , were using colour bags and eggs .	-6.9962
Six people were arrested , 24 others were easily injured , and the authorities were invoked .	-5.1971
On Monday , for the first time , the referendum on independence will take place .	-3.8545
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain , Catalonia ’ s central government had been forced to govern under coercion in the autumn of 2017 .	-5.5848
The then regional president , Carles Puigdemont , flew to exile to Belgium .	-2.9271
Other politicians , too , have turned out abroad .	-5.1397
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement , however , continue to be imprisoned in U-pris.	-5.0944
In December , new elections were held in the region .	-1.7790
Following the inauguration of the new Catalan Government in May , the forced administration was brought to an end .	-4.6750
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the ' right to self-determination ' of Catalans .	-5.2468
Football : Oberliga Westfalen : Versammelte Ratlosigkeit : FC Gütersloh und RW Ahlen separates themselves torlos .	-3.5366
Red White Ahlen continues on the spot .	-3.6964
The FC Gütersloh also had only a 0 : 0 draw .	-4.8902
The final light and the third final turns them out to be assembled in the Heidewaldstadion before 438 viewers .	-8.3975
The first half was obscure by the entertainment factor .	-3.3270
For this reason , anyone who wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst could not care about it .	-6.2800
There was no danger of missing a Torchance because there was practically no .	-4.4652
First shot after half an hour	-1.3267
For the first ( harmless ) torch of the entire game , Güterslohs Nick Flock recorded in the 28th minute .	-4.2013
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility was the Ahlener when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty limit .	-5.5780
The hosts were even more harmless .	-2.3852
Their most effective action was an early change .	-2.2845
He had to be exchanged for injuries and Sinan Aygün came .	-6.0828
After the change , both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom .	-4.3746
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel scored 18 metres above the housing and after an hour the freight slots also appeared offensive for the first time .	-7.4941
After a conquest of Matthäus Wieckowicz it went fix .	-3.8314
The swiftly presented Konter about Sinan Aygün " crowned " Nick Flock ( 62. ) with a leap in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann .	-6.1244
In addition , they moved with a headball from Wieckowicz ( 66. ) to a corner ball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein .	-7.8377
RWA-Interimstrainer Angelo Daut responded , first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy ( 60 ) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel ( 70 ) .	-3.5868
There was nothing .	-4.2954
More than optical superiority , thanks to its own initiative , the Ahlener did not bring about .	-4.3902
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance , but also that brought nothing .	-4.3205
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive : " I like that we played at zero " , but unfortunately the zero was also on the front .	-6.5777
" This time we were not as torical as we were against wood wrapping and that even though our opponent had no desire to play here " , RW Ahlens said Interimstrainer .	-8.0191
Offensive " everything went so much " against a team that only wanted to defend .	-6.5592
In any case , I did not feel that we could get a counter-tor , ' says Daut .	-4.4783
However , as a spectator , he did not feel as though his team could shoot a gateway .	-6.0747
For that , the idea was too weak .	-3.8544
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt : Fortunately , there are enough chalmers .	-2.5896
This is Brigitte Ransmann , Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabausestelle for which these donations are intended .	-4.3146
The Honorary Officers assure : " These donations remain in Reckenfeld " .	-5.4306
At the opening the sky became bright blue , but the square was still slightly empty , but that should change during the day .	-7.3217
Because : " Here it is so nice sociable , so we are here today , " said a visitor .	-4.2698
The organiser of the Festes Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper prise Humor .	-3.7071
For the couple of Brockmann , who should be woken up against food , Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term .	-4.7087
Verena ( daughter of Ferdi Kreimer ) has become ill .	-1.5519
But there are enough chalmers .	-1.9317
And the " replacement " was not allowed to entertain the increasing number of visitors in music between .	-11.3684
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour .	-4.7839
" Simple " , Marcel Kreimer joked .	-2.6162
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to present the opening date this time in his schedule .	-3.7876
He is pleased with the many assets with their stands , including clubs .	-5.8526
" Actually , there should be something like a table " , he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir .	-4.6572
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other fortresses that took place in September and the Clean up action .	-6.7850
Our garden town gives itself a colorful touch - what goes on here .	-6.3645
Then the Maikranz of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was taken off with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarter .	-5.0921
Many stands have been worked for the physical well-being .	-4.9105
From sweetness to heart everything was to have .	-3.6505
Stefan Hagemeyer , who lives in Reckenfeld only for one year , was creative at his décor .	-4.1032
Furnishes , beer lid with reckenfelder motiven and much more he had in offer .	-6.4081
A speciality offered three Reckenfelder Imker : " Reckenfelder Honig " , brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka , Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter .	-3.1618
The latter has a speciality .	-3.5491
Honey cake in glass , of course with honey from my own production .	-2.0582
The little Elsa had to access again and again , so well tasted the cake .	-5.8087
The conviviality is that the visitors then left for a long time until the evening hours , even without a stage programme that is not available at the autumn festival .	-7.8326
Schmier events with local political message : No successful advertising for skateboarding .	-6.7002
In Lengerich , unknown people have hardly promoted the construction of a skateboard .	-4.2038
In several places there are lubricants , Jürgen Kohne says from the city council on request of the WN .	-5.6703
In at least one case , the police have been charged with charges of any kind .	-6.4647
In large letters the three words " Skatepark for Lengerich ! " are displayed on signs , including the Gempt-Halle and Alten Rathaus .	-6.1646
Michael Rottmann , manager of the hall , reports that a correspondent letter was discovered at the staircase at the Gempt-Bistro trade fair on 19 September .	-6.8081
Since the short message was apparently " just " left with an Edding , they could easily be removed .	-5.8859
" A few days later this was again there , this time open " , says Rottmann .	-5.5572
It assumes that the corresponding advertisement must be replaced .	-3.9762
A special note is given in this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on on the .	-6.2920
If the skateboard is built , its realization will also be made possible by sponsors .	-5.0231
Promises have already been made , explained by Jörg Hesselmann from the urban field of school , sport and culture without name .	-5.5853
Well possible , however , that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the approved table .	-5.3321
For years local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skateboarding .	-4.9400
After removing the old one at the LWL clinic , the search for an alternative location began some time .	-4.8629
The Council , after all , advocated a majority in favour of the fire-fighting park .	-5.6115
However , too many factors seem to have opposed building at this point .	-5.5613
At the end of June , a U-turn followed .	-2.7013
The members of the main and financial committee voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School .	-3.0212
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning .	-4.0764
The last word then comes from the City Council .	-3.1273
He proceeds from a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built in 2019 .	-4.0458
Closer air traffic control bottlenecks are getting worse .	-3.4791
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer , German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year .	-3.1678
" This year we had wind , 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm " , said the head of the trade union of air traffic control , Matthias Maas , the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October .	-4.4885
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known staffing force in European air traffic safety , for which there is no quick solution .	-6.4546
" Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for next year , but training new pilots takes four to five years , " said the trade unionist .	-3.4133
Europe is the market for fully trained pilots .	-3.6506

On September 29 , 1893 , an orchard in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus set the last foundation impulse for the association for horticulture and Landespflege Kulmbach , and exactly 125 years later , on Saturday evening he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle .	-7.1098
However , he was told differently at that time : when the Kulmbach City and Land District obstructionist Wilhelm Flessa was born in 1893 .	-7.7597
The purpose of the fruit tree association also differed from today 's work - in fact , it was purely about fruit growing , flowers and gardening that nobody thought .	-7.8172
" At that time , in the Enlightenment era , the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites , " explained Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his presentation .	-4.8696
Fruit trees should be lined by highways , so-called industrial gardens were created by schools .	-6.3832
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in Kulmbach , which comprise almost 7000 members .	-6.4119
But the spectrum is far from exhausted .	-3.9187

He led the many visitors with a pictorial presentation through the long history of the circle association and reported , among other things , the need for self-sufficiency after the war .	-6.6101
In the past , everything came out of the garden , for the winter it was dosed .	-5.4716
At the end of the 1950s , however , the garden turned into a garden of ornaments and gardens .	-5.0797
" Nature persists , it was there before us , and we must orient ourselves to it " , the expert in fruit and nut trees pleaded .	-8.5089
For this reason , there is an incentive for the gardening associations not to let down so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living .	-8.1882
These include welcoming the new citizens in our clubs , the President of the Bavarian State Association , Wolfram Vaitl .	-4.4504
" We must stop the glaring decline in insects , which we owe to our children and grandchildren , " Günter Reif concluded the festival that was solemnly surrounded by the Turmbläsern of the Thurnau Music Association .	-5.7637

Trump himmelt Kim : " And then we fell in love "	-3.2489
The fact that US President North Korea ’ s leader , Kim , is well disposed to despite the nuclear crisis , is no secret .	-4.0118

No , really .	-1.5669
And not only the talks with Kim would have brought his heart to melt .	-3.4512
He wrote me beautiful letters , it was great letters .	-2.8970
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit : Trump referred to the stump of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim , even though critics have seen little more than lip service .	-5.9701
That the affection for the infamous Rocket Man – Trump ’ s nickname for Kim – may not be upright for everyone , seemed well aware of the US president .	-7.0537
In any case , he immediately anticipated criticism of his performance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling : " Donald Trump says they fell in love " .	-4.8446
How terrible , how terrible is that ?	-2.1945
That is so imprecise .	-2.6712
But he did not care much about that , Trump declared , and then put his finger on the crowd : " I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential " .	-6.5984
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there pushing into this stuffed arena , but we would only have 200 people out there .	-5.6033

Pleite at Hertha : Asked for reality : Bayern versus Ajax .	-5.8036
The predicate is unbeatable : the defeat in Berlin does not want to let the FC Bayern " fall .	-5.6702
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim ruling for Niko Kovac ’ s term .	-4.1363

" A week ago we had the impression that we are invisible .	-3.5296
Now we got a bit of the reality , " said Thomas Müller after the earned 0 : 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and asked for a reaction for the Champions-League-Duell with Ajax Amsterdam .	-5.4250
Anyone who knows us is aware that this is a real irritation and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday .	-6.1736
For the first time since more than a year out , no own gate was shot , as at the same time as the pre-season two compulsory games in series without victory , the table leadership in the football league lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being .	-7.0971
The overall situation is not as dramatic as the final stage of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017 , but the record master must be warned .	-4.7813
The FC Augsburg at 1 : 1 with its elaborate Mann-gegen-Mann-Taktik and the Berliner by their playful needle sticks over the outside delivered two blueprints within three days , just as the last over-powerful Bavaria is to be cracked .	-9.1892
" The people who know the FC Bayern know that we don 't like this and we will do everything we can to ensure that we succeed again , " said Kovac .	-7.8215
Otherwise , with his losers in his birthtown , he went surprisingly gently , and pushed his first defeat as Munich coach only to the yet again flawed approach to opportunities .	-8.9884
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nonetheless make the first stopover in his term of office a positive one - otherwise the tone will probably worsen .	-5.5177
Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second class performance of this season after 2 : 0 at Benfica Lisbon .	-5.7463
After the free day on Sunday , as planned , the short preparation for the second championship against Ajax , which was also sovereign for the start of AEK Athens with 3 : 0 .	-5.7397
" Now we caught up in two games , but we will also make our goals again , " said national team paper Manuel Neuer .	-5.8842
As after the lost Cup finals against Eintracht Frankfurt , Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly .	-4.7721
The legal defender appeared in the role of Mahner .	-3.8413
" I do not believe that all this is bad , we also have to work out it again , because we do not make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes at the back " , said the 23-year-old just before departure from the Olympic Stadium .	-7.7929
On the seventh day of the previous season , Bavaria even had five counts behind Dortmund , which has now taken the lead again with one point .	-7.5744
And so , with an eye-fork , Kimmich at least appreciated that the public debate on supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has ended .	-7.9709
" Yes , that is already good , " said the national player .	-3.9922
It is good for the League .	-2.5328
DFB-Boss in Schusslinie : Özil-Causa : Sharfe attack by Erdogan on Grindel	-5.1426

DFB President Grindel may see mistakes , but defends the association slinie .	-3.9085
Now a new post is to be created .	-2.8223
Berlin - On different stages , Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation of Mesut Özil in the Permanent Strait .	-5.3107
After the Turkish President criticised the handling of the former World Champion in Germany , the DFB chief defended the Verbandslinie in order to open the big Ditib-Mosque in Cologne .	-6.0172
At the early Sunday morning , Grindel , personally attacked by Özil in the Mainzer ZDF- " Sportstudio " announced consequences from Causa .	-5.8375
" We need to draw very precise conclusions in future - because we also have many migrants ' backgrounds in the U-teams - that this is something that is not repeated , " said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as further integration commissioner .	-8.4704
At the same time , Grindel once again stated that Erdogan was not in favour of the values of football and the DFB .	-2.8289
It had denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in harsh terms .	-5.7903
Our born and raised Mesut Özil in Germany and our Ilkay .	-3.8978
They excluded them from this society because they could photograph with me in England , " said Erdogan on Saturday in the city .	-4.8220
To be honest , as its President , I could not digest the fact that our two young men who have risen to the German national team were excluded .	-5.3855
Grindel referred to Gündogan 's statement that , contrary to Özil after the World Cup affair , which had begun by photos of the two with Erdogan , he felt " sensibly treated by the DFB " .	-6.2327
At the same time , he announced that he would like to face up to players in the future .	-3.7484
That someone says : If I win , I am German when I lose , I am Migrant - that is not possible .	-4.0792
" That he has such an impression , I very much regret , " said Grindel .	-2.8657
We should have defended Mesut more , as I have always said .	-2.2786
But he does not see any basis for Özils ’ return to the national team .	-3.7541
As a consequence , besides the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic , who has family roots in Cameroon , an additional integration commissioner will be appointed .	-4.9160
" If there is a clear effect on society and football without a background of migration , and says : " The subject is important , we must take care of it " , which would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs , where integration must work , " said Grindel .	-7.9329
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair , he wants to stand again for the post as President of the DFB next year .	-5.5137
" I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes , " said Grindel .	-3.4042

Knicks , as a corridor , scattered habitats that can still function through the exchange of organisms , as the Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Association ( NABU ) said in Schleswig-Holstein , Ingo Ludwichowski .	-5.2868
Knicks are Living fences	-1.6133
The Knicks were driven by a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766 , which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein .	-5.3715
The " living fences " were not only field limits and cattle fences , they also supplied firewood and beams for their specialist houses .	-5.4983
From that time , his name " Knick " also comes from : " Umknicken " the branches could develop the dense , intertwined boundaries .	-8.3203
Today , around 45 000 kilometres of hedges are stretched between the North and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a large and varied landscape .	-6.7194

According to the Ministry of Agriculture , the Knickpflege can only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March .	-5.0030

Do you have any information about this ?	-2.0484
We don 't know the reasons , but when the warnings came , many " Okay , no tsunami " - and then he came .	-6.1183
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami , there was misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they are curious about the surrounding mountains .	-4.2593
Is an island like Sulawesi , located on the Pacific Fire Ring , not prepared for earthquakes ?	-3.0924
But , every day there are earthquakes , but that was the worst .	-2.8672
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuation .	-2.6926
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed , the earthquake has hit a great many people .	-3.2450

The biggest shortcoming in the afternoon : Royal blue missed it to worry about clearer conditions .	-5.2942
After all , the possibilities were there , for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka , who twice met the Latte 59th / 72nd or Amine Harit 62 .	-7.3620

The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question .	-3.1823
At a table , German society , at the cat table , is sitting the first generation migrants .	-4.0954
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be on the table .	-3.2608
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany , they have always sat on the big table and now want to take part .	-4.4955
This leads to conflicts .	-1.7424
Therefore , it is not crucial whether political or left-wing , but : ' Do I support or against an open society ? ' .	-8.1048
Initially , rather than behaving , the discussion round is always running out .	-7.3026
And there is a need for talk .	-3.2084
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective , two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with pupils .	-3.4800
El-Mafaalani is on stage , not on stage , a symbol of discussion : it is on an equal footing .	-4.5849
Sociology professor does not urge his opinion , emphasizes that he speaks of average , not of individual destiny .	-5.4241

For the third time in a row , Naldo does not thank Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco .	-3.8704
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues spent the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf , but on the exchange-bank , the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two meters of Brazilians had rightly spoken the frustration of the soul .	-7.0184
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after 1 : 0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 as usual , and when chief trainer Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals , the 36-year-old , who called all the simplest half Naldo , said : " We have to thank trainers ! "	-8.7069
" This was very emotional , it was great sport , " later Tedesco said about the reaction of his vice-captain who , despite his renewed reserve existence , did not have any resentment .	-6.4056
Problích knows Naldo , who was celebrated last season as the best songwriter , that he did not really get a pause for his coach , but for good reasons .	-7.0229
A reason called " stress control " .	-3.4865
It was not easy to tell him that .	-2.3244
" It was not easy to tell him that I say to you quite honestly , " said Tedesco of the moment he told Naldo that he was not in the start eleven .	-4.7999
He is an important player , he is an important person .	-1.9554
