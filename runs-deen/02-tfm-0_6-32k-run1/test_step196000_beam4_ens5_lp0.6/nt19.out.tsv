The Munich trip to the high north was not very good .	-6.7173
On Saturday he posted a rare fie - his face is completely broken , the eyes only two small slits .	-5.7676
The Bett-Selfie shows a completely loud Florian David Fitz .	-3.9364
But he is not sick , he has only a powerful cat .	-2.9739
At his fans he posted some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now won : " Rule one : goes NIE to Inas night .	-6.0148
Usually two : never trinks the black suction .	-2.6407
And injection .	-1.6311
And the round of Eierlikör , which melts Ina around half three , also leaves away .	-4.5984
Alcohol consumption is literally written in the face of the 43-year-old .	-3.5318
His fans posted a few tips to fight the offspring .	-4.6506
They were abundant of instant quarries , fish crumbs , or , presumably , most purposeful , headache tablets .	-6.9608
Other amusing simply glanced over the sight of the usually attractive cinema .	-4.7173
As Ina Müller has survived the next sauna store , it has not yet been known .	-6.0486
Since she already moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007 , the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried ...	-5.5255
On a beer with Ina Müller .	-1.6454
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and betrayal .	-3.6278
The starting point in the 36 km long railway trail in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired .	-6.0572
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are being sought , but solutions are hardly emerging .	-4.1015
Scherben , Cigarette Coats , Müll and Unrat , demolished dustbin and now dismantled shields - for a long time now the starting point with a seat group for cycling on the Haaße hill in Treysa .	-8.8490
The Rotkäppchenland railway line is more than a glorious sight for the flagship project .	-6.8982
The topic concerns members of the ADFC Group Schwalmstadt but also others , so the Radverkehrsbeauftragte of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen has .	-7.5127
The problem has already been raised in the Committee on Transport and Tourism .	-3.0185
There is no solution .	-2.6332
The proposals range from the laying down of the seat group to regular unloading of waste containers and cleaning of land at the entry point .	-7.2271
" I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities " , says Wüstenhagen .	-4.5395
Guido Hahn ( ADFC ) reports that the topic has also been submitted to the local council .	-4.0499
It is not only the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrating weekends .	-5.9039
This is not only often said to be the case , but also destroyed in the event of a failure : posts from the earth , dustbin demolished , shields burned , seat furniture burned .	-12.4433
Volunteers have already been cleared up more often , says ADFC member Susanne Klippert .	-3.9382
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean .	-3.0376
You will be delighted to find the Rastplatz on the cycle path in Treysa meeting place for saunas .	-7.6191
" Along the entire cycle path there is a clear emphasis on the Haaße hill , " confirmed by the Radverkehrsbeauftragte who is now also taking care of the new Radstätte in Ziegenhain , which is being opened today .	-8.4387
" If it does the same fate , it will be expensive " .	-5.4223
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill : " It is possible that the threshold is significantly higher , that the common good is intertwined .	-6.9777
But that would presuppose that a police strike would then occur in a timely manner .	-6.3543
In principle , Wüstenhagen wants to develop the Haaße hill .	-4.1487
It must be made more attractive .	-1.3517
With the frequency of the radar path you can be very satisfied .	-6.4958
The tourist marketing is still able to grow .	-7.3647
Our cycling path is very high quality compared to other in Germany , so the ADFC members .	-4.9474
As a highly critical danger source , ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa .	-4.5352
There is no sign on the Haaße hill .	-3.6831
In the case of rain traffic , cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow , " she .	-5.6141
This is not a problem for sporty drivers , but it is a problem for older people and especially for children .	-4.4392

Womit sahen sich die Texter verbunden ?	-2.5628
The Hiltruper lake and the market alley were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages .	-6.6720
Rolf Ihmig arbitrary the avenue in his striking song to " Kö von Hiltrup " .	-4.1482

Karl Franke belebte die kurzen Umbaupausen mit Kurz-Interviews mit den Interpreten oder Hinweisen zu ihrem Schaffen .	-2.4378

" It is not about winning , " Franke said .	-2.6361
In fact , all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy .	-3.3720
For the favorites of the jury there was nevertheless something special - so that others can hear their songs .	-5.3459
A whole CD can be Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann .	-2.5671
Other musicians can record a song : Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer , who impressed Franke especially with his musicality , and the " Lummerland-Rudel " : " a very beautiful performance " with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon , Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle .	-4.9170
As everyone has said , the children went to the final once again - and even without electronic support - ' right ' , as Franke said .	-7.2112
The jury was guided by the aspects originality , relation to Hiltrup , interference of the melody and recognition value .	-4.8592
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik , Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association and Jan Kaven , Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive .	-4.1476

The word game : " Decrypto " in the gameplay . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-6.3754
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other .	-2.9962
For each page there is a screen , in which four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - when you put them in .	-6.5359
This ensures that the item page can not read anything .	-5.1146
On the maps , for example , you can read from left to right : " 1st Renaissance .	-4.9753

His task in this case : He should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms " dice " , " feast " and " window " - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not ; because that wins the game if it succeeds twice to crack the code .	-6.4198
The encoder thus notifies and reads aloud : " Werfen " for the dice , " Lose " as contrast to feast ; here would of course also be something like " party " possible and " Prague " because he has adapted in school and knows the window curve there .	-7.3411

Through her marriage to Hans von Borsody : Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband .	-2.2862

Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the " Traumschiff " made Heide Keller ( 76 ) famous , but on January 1 , 2018 she went for ever aboard .	-3.9848

Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards : on 1 September , the proportion of women was 30.5 % - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago .	-6.0659

Already from 10 o 'clock , the Bolids were ripped up in front of the entrance portal the church .	-7.4751
First of all , the Biker-Frühschoppen was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a defy curry sausage .	-6.6739
In addition to the MoGo team , the Holy Riders , a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach , were also present .	-3.5870
The preaching was carried out during the Biker-Gottesdienst Pfarrer Dirk Grzegorek .	-4.4817
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill was responsible for the musical underscore .	-4.9734
" Although the bikers prefer blues rock , Valerie Lill is more poetic and quiet tones of " , Pfarrer Frank Schröder .	-8.7473
This , too , was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday .	-3.3351
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big feast : After the apple comes the milk milk	-4.4063
And also in the actual day of action Borisch was active .	-3.9133
They prepared their hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes .	-3.6301
Great interest also aroused Georg Hartmann Niemerg .	-2.7504
He had his apple press in the luggage and demonstrated his astonishing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice .	-4.5645
Then and when Hartmann Niemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big funnel .	-3.6290
With a little muscle force , a fine crushed mass has been removed from the apples .	-4.6065
Not many of the children could have imagined how to make a tasty drink .	-6.1541
But they were also able to look at this important step at this late Friday afternoon .	-3.8204
In forms packed and wrapped by nets , Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacks a little like hardened well looking apple pipes layer for layers .	-12.9390
Thanks to some technical support , the last step in the work was no longer so difficult .	-4.3720
The freshly squeezed juice went to and into a large vessel .	-5.8530
But the farmer had already finished filling specialities .	-4.6702
So he opened his " treasure box " and presented to the older visitors the latest spring white .	-4.5617
The demand for the good drop " Made in Füchtorf " was correspondingly high .	-3.5173
In a cosy atmosphere , the parents came into contact , while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press , but also the built refuge for themselves discovered .	-6.7122
Also active of the Füchtorfer Cameroon of former soldiers committed themselves within the framework of the festival and invited to play a few stops .	-6.8662
In the coming year , the Heimatverein will also offer an action day .	-4.5450
But then , as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out , the home will not be in the heart of what is happening in the place of saving money .	-6.6504
Instead , a farm will be visited .	-2.2859
This is also obvious because of the issue : after all , it will be around milk .	-5.2933
1 : 4 gegen Frankfurt : Hannover mit vierter Saison-Pleite : " Beschissene Situation "	-1.3931
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat , trainer André Breitenreiter assembled his disappointed professionals from Hanover 96 to speak to them courage .	-5.4907
There were many positive things before : 1 : 4 ( 0 : 2 ) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt , however , did not see .	-5.0369
" It is a grim situation , but you have to go out as a team , " said 96-soccer professional Pirmin Schwegler and shoved : " This is obviously disappointing , because you always take a lot " .	-7.7510
The farcical Lower Saxony , for which only Florent Muslija ( 86th ) met , has two meters downwards and is a candidate for descent in its current constitution .	-7.5569
On the other hand , Angeführt of the surprising Ante Rebic celebrated the first season home victory in Frankfurt .	-9.0816
In the 36th minute , Rebic ( 451 + 1 ) , Jonathan de Guzmán ( 59th ) and Luka Jovic ( 89th ) before 46,300 spectators reached the goals for the DFB Cup winner , who , after the successful general test for the European League game against Lazio Rome , proposed seven points in the middle field of the table .	-7.7306
Croatia ’ s Vice World Champion Rebic was almost involved in any dangerous offensive of the Hessen in his debut debut , and never got to grips with Hanover ’ s defense .	-7.4580
After the World Cup , the shocking stormer showed with his pace and perseverance why he is so valuable for the harmony .	-7.3416
In addition to Rebic , the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurt , the Brazilian Allan fled from the FC Liverpool .	-9.0495
A tornet of falsified headball from Lucas Torró ( 17 ) was first put at risk .	-6.5007
Six minutes later , Sébastien Haller became richer at the last moment in Brazil ’ s 96-defense , which replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer ( back ) .	-5.9333
The leaders of the Hausherren were almost inevitably and utterly deserved .	-4.5104
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a fenced corner in the penal hall , he extended his head in front of the gate where Ndicka only needed to keep the foot . .	-10.8927
It was the first Bundesligatreffer for the defender players who had been taken from the French second league AJ Auxerre in the summer .	-7.3898
And Frankfurt still took a break .	-3.7253
This time , Haller adapted to his Sturmpartner Rebic , who had not had any chance of winning through and 96-Torwart Michael Esser .	-11.4762
In the mid-term Hanover Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak idea of his elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt .	-5.6871
The Lower Saxony played a bit bolder now , but soon before the end of ideas , when the connection buffer was still available .	-9.9149
Hessen was far more efficient .	-6.5661
After a tight hour Rebic started a solo and then put right on De Guzmán , who had to push the ball into the empty gate .	-6.0040
The rest was only show run for the Frankfurt guests , Jovic also met one minute before the end .	-5.9862

Geisingen : Geisinger Christen feiern Heilig-Kreuz-Fest est	-6.5370
The violinist Katholiken celebrates the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or on Sunday afterwards .	-4.3659
The Festgottesdienst takes place in the city church , then a procession to the Heilig-Kreuz-Kirche with the final .	-6.1700
The Holy Cross Church houses the story of Christ , which dates from the Thirty Years ’ War and is to be shot on the legend after a Swedish soldier .	-7.3263
The blood flowed out of the shot .	-5.1530
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shouted Christ , which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church .	-5.7739
This is not finished to this day , only the old tree stands , the missing longhouse is hinted by the trees .	-10.9578
In his preaching , Pfarrer reminded Adolf Buhl that the cross was a sign of hope , of comfort and of life .	-7.1169
The service of God was poorly attended despite the importance of the violinist Pfarrei .	-5.6071
After the service of God , the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and ended with the closing blessing of the church part of the Cross .	-5.3678
For many years the Catholic Church choir has been inviting to the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish .	-5.2393
The choir members sent visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted , farm ice .	-5.7707
In the afternoon the parish congregations still offered guided tours around the town church , Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid Seger informed the visitors about the damage to facade , roof , sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will be dragging into the next year .	-7.5114
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time , the damage could be more accurately identified and the individual tenders could be made more concrete .	-7.8220
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned , because the damage that has already been done a few years ago has increased , but more has also been said about what was possible only through the use of scaffolding .	-8.6114
The socket plaster beits are finished , before the winter is to be started with the natural stone work and one hopes to finish half of this work this year .	-6.8292
inauguration : Neues Wohnheim in der Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße	-2.2889
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße .	-4.0572
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße a very special house will now be handed over to his determination - all those present agreed on the objections .	-8.3490
After all , the twelve wheelchair users who have already been living in the home of the Donau-Iller living for some time now rely on the special architecture of the new building .	-11.6256
Broader corridors , corridors and doors , larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas , architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account his concept .	-8.2370
The first plans began about eight years ago , when the former officer building of the US Army was put on the test bench for the inhabitants with Handycap : " The house had come into the years and no longer timed according to the equipment " , said Bader retrospectively .	-7.2071
In 2016 , the excavators crashed around the house .	-3.5326
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible , so that the inhabitants can feel at ease .	-5.8042
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new residential home in Iller . . . . . . . . . the . the	-8.6356
Around EUR 4.6 million was invested in new construction .	-4.2684
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million , the district gave EUR 450000 .	-4.4250
According to the architect Bader , the building works have remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms .	-5.8015
He also thanked the Managing Director of Lebenshilfe , Jürgen Heinz .	-3.5236
The gap between a barrier-free construction and , at the same time , refractory construction was not always easy .	-4.6912
However , the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many requirements that the inhabitants of freedom had to experience without being able to move outside help .	-7.5434
Similarly , the head of the district ’ s social administration , Gertrud Kreutmayer , said : “ The house is geared to the special needs of its residents , who need tools to be mobile . ”	-6.0368
In doing so , housing and functionality have been combined well , said Kreutmayer .	-5.0361
And further : " The plot in this situation is a real lucky event because it is so in today 's situation no longer to acquire " .	-5.7453
Altogether , the new residential home in the Münsterblickstraße is located on almost 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three living groups .	-6.4186
The life aid manager Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees , all of whom are employed by collective bargaining .	-9.6417
Germany : Swede laments differences between East and West	-2.9615
Berlin - Before the day of unity , the deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to deal with the disadvantages of East German .	-4.8562
There are differences that are painful after almost 30 years of unity .	-2.9126
With these differences , we must not be satisfied , " said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Sunday .	-8.7432
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country .	-2.5878
It is unacceptable that , on average , East Germany worked longer than the people of West Germany , but 15 % were less salary .	-4.8779
" I can explain this almost 30 years after German unity no one , " said Schwesig .	-4.2260
North Korea : Will this putty dog end the Korean conflict ?	-3.3198
The one-year Pungsan hunting and is supposed to smooth the Wogen between the two Koreas .	-4.8062
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul , Pyongyang gave South Korean President Moon Jae two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs a gift .	-7.6322
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday , the two dogs reached their recipients about a year ago on Thursday .	-5.2232
They therefore passive the border town of Panmunjom , together with three kilograms of dog food , in order to facilitate the animals ' reconciliation ' .	-5.4286
The dogs with thick white fur , pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent .	-2.8691
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .	-2.0941
Kim Jong-un , North Korea ’ s leader , announced in Pyongyang in mid-September that the North had given the Moon and North Korea a third summit this year .	-8.7281
Both countries also agreed to join together in international sporting competitions , such as the 2020 Olympic Games , and jointly bid to host the 2032 Olympic Games .	-5.4413
In the course of mutual rapprochement , Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile drives .	-3.9331
Austria ’ s Moved History in Mirror of 99 Documents	-2.1628
What is Austria ?	-0.5093
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic , which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months , numerous new books have been published that answer this question mostly in retrospect to the last hundred years .	-5.9231
In a very different way , Wolfgang Maderthaner , historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives , puts it in the splendid " Bilderbuch " Austria , which will be released on October 1 .	-5.5887
New Week , New Chance for the Government	-5.4850
Back to substantive work - that is the unofficial slogan for today ’ s emerging Great Coalition working week .	-9.0248
Hardly an interview , hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her CDU ministers , SPD and also CSU last summoned the " return to the subject matter " .	-6.5809
This may be the case for some craftsmen , doctors , cashiers and other active citizens in this country who are entitled to question what is actually the difference between work and material work , but whether it is ' s drum .	-7.8677
If the federal government is now ready to return to its mandate - to govern - then it should not be discouraged from debating terms .	-6.8805
Whether the Union and the SPD can really do something together after the provocations and bubbles of the last few weeks is likely to show Monday .	-6.2961
In the evening , the leaders of the governing parties come together to form a coalition committee .	-4.2555
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round on a regular basis to defuse conflicts at an early stage ; a lesson from all the quarrels . . . the the . the . the . the .	-8.4885
First of all , however , there are conflicting issues on the agenda with the Diesel retrofit and the specialist immigration law .	-6.3052
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with exchange-rate premiums on a shrinking basis , SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the duty to retrofit older diesel .	-7.5078
While a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis over the weekend , the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned law on skilled workers .	-6.0121
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training .	-3.9889
The Union is strongly opposed to the ' change of track ' from the asylum system to the labour market .	-3.6630
So there will be a row again among coalition partners - and how should it be different ?	-4.5017
Not equal and equal has coalesced together , but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities .	-6.1406
Dispute is good .	-2.0291
Without dispute , a society that is so diverse , sometimes contradictory , is not making progress .	-5.9117
However , in order to be constructive , there must be no question of his or her disagreement for party-political reasons .	-6.1441
We are still talking about politics , not theatre .	-3.0407
The Union and SPD are supposed to strike - but always have a view of the reality of people 's lives .	-6.8874
What is feasible and useful to many ?	-2.0277
With this key issue , both the diesel and the track change issue can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence .	-5.8288
Above all , the grass-roots parties must fight now .	-3.7969
Pilz reviews working hours at Hartinger	-2.0454
Minister in Visier	-1.4284
Does the Minister of Labour , in particular , violate the law of service in force ?	-6.1967
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look .	-2.6334
" Really day and night " would have worked their legists on the social security reform , reported a manageable Social Minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago .	-5.6876
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger , Beate Hartinger-Klein ( FPÖ ) has said that she is bringing the matter to Parliament via question .	-5.5383
They assume that ' the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and certainly did not want to proclaim offences against the right of service before running cameras ' .	-8.5417
Nevertheless , they are now asking questions to free Har ­ tinger from any suspicion .	-4.7324
Police Strip for Women 's Equality	-5.0291
Marxgrün - For a long time , the police did not want to comment on this .	-3.2416
There is now confirmation .	-1.8499
Since early Saturday morning , the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is being excavated .	-4.2487
The route is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday .	-3.3638
It was anticipated that the investigators had previously used an archaeologist .	-4.8106
The dog , specially trained for the smell of old human bones , together with his guide , was finally able to limit the relevant place to a few metres in the multi-color application .	-8.2318
In addition , together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Monument Protection Agency , a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said street property .	-4.9946
For more than a year now , prosecutors and criminals have been forgiving the offence .	-5.3965
Marxgrün has repeatedly been locked off a cycle path and investigated with sonars , because the investigators suspect that this could have been squandered in the course of rebuilding the state road 30 years ago Heike ’ s body .	-8.4568
Colour powder and eggs : Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary	-2.7934
On Monday , the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be the first time .	-4.4865
But it is already coming to crafts .	-5.7563
The separatists did not forget the police operation in the autumn of 2017 .	-3.3086
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of 1 October 2017 , the Barcelona Center met with clashes between separatists and the police .	-4.1135
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates , among other things , with colour powders , when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard .	-5.8729
Around 3000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honour their colleagues with a rally that was illegal last year in the referendum in the polling stations .	-6.6552
In trying to prevent citizens from voting , violence also occurred at the time . . the . the the . the the the the . the . the	-7.9182
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and the central state security forces separate , reported Spanish media .	-3.7562
Some of the 6000 separatists would then have tried to break the police chain , and the officials , among other things , exploded with colour bags and eggs .	-6.8223
Six people have been arrested , 24 more have been easily injured , and they have been referred to by the authorities .	-5.0483
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum .	-3.2622
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain , the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under forced government in the autumn of 2017 .	-4.3312
The then regional president , Carles Puigdemont , fled into exile to Belgium .	-2.2153
Other politicians , too , went abroad .	-3.6105
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement , on the other hand , remain in U-prisons .	-4.4193
In December , new elections were held in the region .	-2.0449
After the new Catalan government took office in May , the forced administration was ended .	-4.0539
But the new regional president , Quim Torra , also insists on the ' right to self-determination ' of the Catalans .	-3.3142
Football : Oberliga Westfalen : Versammelte Ratlosigkeit : FC Gütersloh und RW Ahlen trennen sich torlos los Ahlen	-5.7372
Rot White Ahlen continues on the spot .	-4.6133
Even with the FC Gütersloh , it was enough to achieve a 0 : 0 score .	-6.3323
The final light and the third last puppted them in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as assembled helplessness .	-6.3031
The first half was overshadowed by the entertainment factor .	-3.4186
Those who would prefer to pick up a beer or a bratwurst could do so without concern .	-5.9439
There was not a danger of missing a torchance , because there were virtually no .	-4.9657
First shot after half an hour	-1.6345
For the first ( harmless ) shot of the entire lot , Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible in the 28th minute .	-4.6321
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility was the Ahlener , when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling , after 32 minutes with a shot from the penal border to a parade .	-5.7487
Even more harmless were the hosts .	-2.5154
Their most effective action was early change .	-3.1224
He had to be exchanged for the cause of injury by Stürmer Lars Schröder , who came to Aygün for him .	-10.3071
After the change , both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom .	-3.9312
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel came out of 18 meters just above the housing and after an hour the freight sloh also appeared offensive for the first time .	-8.0847
After a ballet by Matthäus Wieckowicz it went fix .	-3.8928
The swift presentation of Konter about Sinan Aygün " crowned " Nick Flock ( 62nd ) with a black shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann .	-6.7234
In addition , they laid a headball from Wieckowicz ( 66th ) to a corner ball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein .	-5.2120
RWA-Interimstrainer Angelo Daut reacted , first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy ( 60. ) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel ( 70. ) .	-4.3488
There was nothing wrong .	-2.1551
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative did not bring about the Ahlenians .	-3.7001
Only in the 91st minute had Cihan Yilmaz the last chance , but also the brought nothing .	-4.2143
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive : ' I like we have played out at zero ' , but unfortunately the zero was also on the front .	-7.6754
" We were not as dangerous this time as we were against wood processing and although our opponent had no desire to play here , " said RW Ahlens Interimstrainer .	-6.1407
Apparently , " everything pledged so a bit " against a team , " which only wanted to defend .	-5.0947
In any case , I did not feel that we could get a counter-war " , says Daut .	-5.0220
But his body was not perceived as a spectator , as if his team were shooting a goal .	-7.3942
For that , the idea was too meagre .	-3.8752
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt : Luckily there are enough chalks for the lucky ones .	-5.3300
The Brigitte Ransmann , Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle , for which these donations are intended .	-3.9067
The Honorary Insurance : " These donations remain in Reckenfeld as well " . the . the . the the the . the . the .	-8.5189
Opening showed the sky shining blue , but the place was still empty , but that should change over the day .	-6.9912
This is because it is so nice to be here today , ' said a visitor .	-8.2956
The organizer of the Festes Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper priest Humor .	-5.3514
For the couple Brockmann , who should be wounded against food , Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term .	-4.6682
The Verena ( daughter of Ferdi Kreimer ) has become sick .	-2.3101
But there is enough chalk .	-1.9134
And the " replacement " did not let it take to entertain more and more visitors by musically .	-5.3309
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour .	-5.6616
" Easy toll " , Marcel Kreimer was delighted .	-3.3861
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to bring the opening date of this time to his schedule .	-5.1612
He is pleased with the many activities with her booths , including mostly clubs .	-5.4626
" Actually , there should be no such thing as a table at all , " he thanked for the action of the male chore .	-5.2044
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those involved in the booths and included the other festivities that took place in September and the Clean up action .	-5.8586
Our garden town has a colorful painting - here 's what goes .	-5.9350
Then the Maikranz was taken off by Georg Knorr and Gerd pieces with the help of the fire brigade and brought into the winter quarter .	-5.0721
Many booths have been used for the good of women .	-4.9093
From sweetness to heart was everything to have .	-3.2635
Stefan Hagemeyer , who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year , was creative in his decoration coffins .	-4.4539
Furniquette , beer-cover with reckening fields motifs and some more he had in offer .	-7.1759
A speciality offered three beekeepers : " Reckenfelder Honig " , brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka , Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter .	-3.4554
The latter still has a speciality .	-3.0899
Honey cake in glass , naturally with honey from my own production .	-7.8520
As the little Elsa had to access again and again , so well tasted the cake .	-4.6508
The conviviality is that the visitors then spend a long time in the evening hours , even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival .	-7.9244
Schmierereien mit lokalpolitischer Botschaft : Keine gelungene Werbung für Skateanlage	-2.0658
In Lengerich , unknown people have hardly promoted the construction of a skateboard .	-6.1900
At several locations there are corresponding lubricants , says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN .	-5.0153
In at least one case , the police have been accused of material damage .	-4.9052
In large letters , the three words " Skatepark für Lengerich ! " are denounced on signs among others at the Gempt-Halle and Alten Rathaus .	-6.4603
Michael Rottmann , manager of the hall , reports that an appropriate font was discovered at the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro after the trade fair on 19 September .	-6.3608
Since the short message was apparently left " only " with an Edding , they can easily be removed .	-5.6803
" Only a few days later , this time it stood up again , " said Rottmann .	-7.4705
It assumes that the advertisement has to be replaced .	-3.8919
A special note is given in this case by the fact that several large companies are also called Lengerich on the board .	-6.3929
If the skateboard is built , its realization should also be made possible by sponsors .	-5.4265
Commitments already exist , explains Jörg Hesselmann of the urban field of school , sport and culture , without naming names .	-9.1278
Good possible , however , that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the coated table .	-4.5273
Local politics and administration have been involved in the topic of skateboarding for years .	-5.5288
After the old LWL clinic had been dismantled , after some time the search for an alternative location began .	-3.8727
After all , the Council was in favour of a majority in the fire service park . .	-9.5506
This inward approach has not been implemented - too many factors seem to have been opposed to the construction of this post .	-10.6087
At the end of June , a U-turn followed .	-2.6601
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the Areal of the Gutenberg School .	-2.8213
Jürgen Kohne says on the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning .	-4.3513
The last word was then taken by the city council .	-7.1338
He will take a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built by 2019 .	-4.7153
Closer air traffic control is getting worse .	-4.9378
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer , German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year .	-3.5966
" This year we had wind , 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm , " said the head of the trade union of air traffic control , Matthias Maas , the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October .	-4.3997
One important reason for the many delays and flight failures is the long-established personnel shortage in European air traffic control systems , for which there is no quick solution .	-6.7764
" Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year , but the training of new pilots takes four to five years , " said the trade unionist .	-8.4190
Europaweit sei der Markt für fertig ausgebildete Lotsen leergefegt .	-2.4621

In the Hanseatic city on Friday , representatives of the Federal Government , the countries , air traffic control , airlines and airports come together to address the causes of delays .	-4.8168
" If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime , this will not go without us , " the head of the GdF , who has many members in Germany 's own Deutsche Flugsicherung .	-6.8364
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the Lotsen-Misere .	-3.2863
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low .	-7.6499
The resulting cost reductions and personnel savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully integrated into the operational business .	-5.7568
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer ( CSU ) to work in Brussels for rules that do not keep air safe .	-6.1837
At the moment , the EU ’ s targets would be agreed by 2024 , and there are grounds for fear of further tightening .	-5.9715
The EU is under constant pressure from the airlines .	-2.6538
" Ryanair Chef Michael O 'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years , " said Maas .	-4.5832
He hopes that the high cost of delays in the airlines will lead to a rethink .	-5.0624
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung ( DFS ) offers a " coherent training and future pact " , said Maas .	-4.1770

Spanish police and civil security officials find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn far more than they earn .	-4.4216
The demonstrators perceived it as provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona .	-3.4507
" Why did they come here to protest ? " asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency .	-3.3845
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they have rushed us a year ago .	-2.9844
A 31-year-old policeman of the Balearic Islands , who only wanted to give his name to Daniel , rejected the charge .	-4.0097
" Of course we want to support our comrades who last year only did their duty : defend the law , " he said .	-2.8855
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona , because that is a great European city and there is more echo here .	-4.3723
He and his colleagues did not come to provoke " , the policeman assured .	-4.0806

" Both for adults and for men " was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck .	-3.5413
As cabaret stars , men understood gender , not only with humour and warmth for the ( felt ) woman and the ( felt ) man , and what else may there be , but also with music .	-7.8758
The mini guitar set her and mastered her violin .	-4.2347
On the wings sat Ben Süverkrüp .	-1.8782
The first is the male sparring partner , who sometimes comes to the end of the sentence , and the other is a true pianist : so congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo .	-8.4484
This was also the case , with Beethoven and Chopin , but in a different way , as was the case with the Red Fades in the evening .	-5.5929
As Teubner had brought a paradox into play : satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner , but it doesn ’ t open the door .	-7.9708
A closed door without a partner , on the other hand , does not bring any benefit .	-4.1198
The Klavier-Solo now demonstrates the same thing : what would have been the result of the composer Mozart 's performance , " Nannerl " would have opened the door unexpectedly ?	-7.4732
Thus , Süverkrüp slides into improvisations , from Bachs " O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden " in das " Lied vom Tod " , and from Mozart g-Moll-Symphonie into a playful dancing .	-4.5887
There were big applause and " Bravo " from the full room .	-3.8592
