Iran Free British Tankers
The United Nations General Debate did not solve the Iranian conflict, but now there is a problem less: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which was held in Iran, could be a puzzle piece in Iran ’ s peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held since mid-July in the Strait of Hormus in Iran, is back in international waters.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now travel to Dubai for medical examinations, declared shipping leader Erik Hånell.
The Foreign Ministry in London described the establishment of the ship illegal, 'this is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law,' said in a communication on Friday.
On 19 July, the shipowners had already been released in September and the remaining 16 members were.
The British Government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar in early July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences, and in mid-August the "Adrian Darya-1" was released.
The Straits of Hormus is one of the most important maritime routes in the world, linking the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the two countries ’ nuclear dispute, with the Americans accusing Iran ’ s leaders to build nuclear weapons, and Iran rejects that. The, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, in order to, and.

India has a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India seems to be predestined to be a "war winner," with the punitive tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People ’ s Republic are forced to reorganise. Financial leaders of Asian firms who are considering relocating their production from China to another country, India calls in a UBS survey, India as one of the preferred alternatives, but not only to do the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war, with a huge pool of young labor and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created India like to play a more significant role in the global production chain.
But now India itself has come into Trump ’ s focus, depreciating the White House as a "kingdom of customs duties," America deprived the emerging country of trade concessions for 2000 products in early June. The US prohibitively accusing India of high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, fringes with India are just a side-scene. And America sees the world ’ s largest democracy through the security glasses. Delhi and Washington shares concern about China ’ s claims for power in the South Indian Ocean.
The problem, however, lies elsewhere: the empirically reinforced thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has a tough state in the Socialist Republic of India. Its eagerness for reform is mainly about bureaucratic madness that has stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state state for too long.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings.
In the West Modi appeals to the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country, not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what Western managers ’ vocabulary. In essence, the India First Advocate was never dependent on protectionist economic policies, preventing Indian firms from being forced to dismiss anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition.

Brexit debate is like a 'walk in the park'

Ukraine affair: Ranghohe Republicans advocate official investigation
"I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the State of Vermont, Phil Scott said, "Where this leads from here, is determined by the facts that are found," he wanted to know more about the Whistleblowers affair before taking action.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, showing that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj on a telephone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, according to.
The Republicans have so far resisted criticism of Trump for the whistleblower-level affair, few have revealed discomfort, with Scott ’ s remarks are now a first sign in Trump ’ s party, with the moderate governor of Virginia has repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, called for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said.
As Governor of US states, Scott and Baker have formally no say in the case of Trump, which is decided in Congress, so their statements are mainly symbolic.
The affair may result in the opening of an impeachment proceedings against Trump, with Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment; with a majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats could make a so-called impeachment, but the decision on actual impeachment would be in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority, so the prospects for success of such a process are small. So far no US president has been removed by the office of impeachment proceedings.

Many members of the government ’ s La République en Marche (The Republic in Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and opposition opposition members had argued for artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be "double grief" if the death of her husband still leaves her desire for children.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can, in future, allow a widow to be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown unknown person, but not with that of their own partner.
Buzyn has already announced in the summer that the surrogate mother will continue to be banned.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.

The estimated ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was launched in 1980, but the State Department still called the US as the "most compelling and generous nation in history," a phrase that reminds the incumbent US president.
“responsible handling ” refugees are aimed at ensuring that refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained, and his hard course of migration policy.
A major contention is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to cut off. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed a national emergency.
According to the Foreign Office, the US government wants to focus on accepting two refugee groups: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are at risk, as indicated by the Foreign Ministry ’ s statement, whereas Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador are to receive a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The United States wants to seek asylum in other countries, especially those from this' northern triangle 'of Central America to seek asylum in other countries, and in this context, the United States only concluded with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras, in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.

The Cafka Lake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel Brexit
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole of Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka ’ s famous narrative, “The Transformation ”, British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27, informed Diogenes Verlag (Zurich), referring to the transformation of a man named Jim Sams, who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now the most powerful man in Britain, who sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people, and is determined to leave nothing and nobody.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When Parliament is closed down, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers are shamelessly lying like Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers were in high positions of the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask what he can do.
In 1915, Kafka's first narrative, published by Gregor Samsa, who wake up one morning and sees himself "transformed into an enormous shake", is gradually excluded from family and society and finally perishes. "Ian McEwan refuses to Kafka to describe a world that stands head," said it by Diogenes Verlag.

Floating Brexit Negotiations: The Risk of a No deal remains acute.
Indeed, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly set out: he won ’ t guarantee a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but what has happened to the polarizing Britons. The recent Supreme Court ruling in Britain hangs like a Damocletian value above the Blondshopfpf; his suspension of Parliament to carry out its Brexit course until the exit date was cancelled at the beginning of this week, and a law passed by Parliament obligated Johnson to extend bilateral talks in the event of failed negotiations with the EU until 31 October.
Boris Johnson Minds Possible
But the pressure does not seem to be over to Johnson, and now, when a hospital visit a hospital, he has suggested that he would support an extension of negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
I am cautiously optimistic that this works.
And time is beginning for Brexit negotiators in Brussels, with about six weeks now, the EU and British negotiators have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without agreement. But recent talks have again failed to make a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult now to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not have the law, a renewed postponement of the exit date is in force; the opposition in force.,,,,..,,,,, in in. in.,,,,,

A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump might actually face an impeachment procedure after the turbulent revelations of recent days; the Democrats want to examine it in the House of Representatives ’ investigation into the House of Representatives.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj, the charge of the whistleblowers, who ultimately brought the conversation out for concern for national security and democracy of the US with his complaint, is monstrous: the president used the power of his office to use the government of another country to influence the 2020 election, which has blackmailed Ukraine ’ s dependence in doing so to force it to act against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also reflected in the now published record of the conversation with Selenskyj, even though it does not reflect the full text, but the July 25 telephone call is only an episode of a much larger story, focusing on his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public ’ s perspective in May 2019 when Rudy Giuliani ’ s New York Times reported by Rudy Giuliani ’ s travel plans to Ukraine in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate.
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump ’ s 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had collected with actors in Ukraine, critics said then to construct an occasion for the US Russian investigation in the US.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giuliani and the president reads: The former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democrats ’ presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, has urged the Obama administration to release the then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Schokin, to stop,,,,,,...,..,.,, in..,,.,,,,,,,,,,,,, in.,., in, in.....
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that Ukraine ’ s prosecutor to go, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected, and Schokin was also accused of deeply corrupt behavior that the US government was far not the only Western partner to urge his release; moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.

Iran Running Uranium enrichment
"Unfortunately, European states show inability or unwillingness to take action," said Rowhani said on Thursday at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York.
As a result of the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained a commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used, or at least prepared for use uranium centrifuges installed at the beginning of September.
Perhaps Europeans would not be willing to take their part of the deal, and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of imposing US sanctions, Rowhani suspected, but there will still be further talks that hopefully will bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran ’ s involvement in Saudi Arabia
In the mid-September following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," Rouhani said, but European leaders would not have been able to do so in talks with him during the UN general debate, but have simply claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this.
Rowhani asked the government in Washington to switch to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet from Other Star
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space, which was previously possible.
What was initially only a presumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system.
The most popular comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters.
2I / Borisov, after 1I /'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object that was sighted during a flight of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to gain insights into a foreign solar system from the near future, before disappearance on Nime canaries.
According to the analysis, the comet is on a so-called hyperbelbahn that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU), also responsible for designation and categorization of celestial bodies.
In contrast to 1I /'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov was already sighted in the beginning, so the researchers have many months for research.
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor, such as a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I /'Oumuamua, who had already led the characterization of 1I /'Oumuamua.
Researchers from the astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of interstellar welding that offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems, but it is still difficult to estimate.
By 2028, the agency wants to deploy the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" (e.g. comet interceptor) on a waiting position at 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth.

Revulsion in Washington: Trump wants to find anonymous donors in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump wants to find out possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," Trump said on Thursday at the United Nations Department in New York.
It was not the case that it was not public, but several US media broadcasted on Friday.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced on Tuesday for an impeachment proceedings against Trump, mainly based on the written complaint by an anonymous intelligence worker who made serious accusations against Trump and his head of government.
In his work, Whistleblower wants to have information from several government officials that the US president "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country interferes in the US election in 2020.
At the heart of the charges is a contentious telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in late July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, earlier deals of Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine, and alleged efforts to protect his sprint from Ukraine ’ s judiciary, Biden is in the race for the Democratic presidential candidature for the 2020 election.

The identity of the indicator is not publicly known, and the New York Times reported that it should be an associate of the CIA ’ s foreign intelligence.
Trump again questioned the source ’ s credibility on Friday, and in a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the whistleblowers had disseminated second-hand information that would have proved to be incorrect, so there might be no tippers or spies.
But, as Trump said in New York about those who should have provided information to whistleblowers information, triggered outrage, with US House House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted worries and lamented that Trump ’ s statement underwent the government ’ s integrity.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations have been underway against Trump and his surroundings in various committees for months, with the Democrats are now pushing ahead with a new effort to launch a possible impeachment process against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the Chief of the Intelligence Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff.
More than 300 former US government officials in the security and foreign policy, most of whom were under democratic, but also Republican presidents, in a statement published on Friday, behind.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure; with a majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats could make a so-called impeachment process; the decision on actual impeachment would be in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans hold the majority, so the prospects for success of such a process are low.

VW Works Council: Jobs are being dismantled 'creeping' creeping 'jobs'

The "Future Pact", which was negotiated between companies and the Works Council in 2016, provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone, by 2020.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from business councils, production jobs that are not really available, are "creeping" through a different way - that is to say, by passing the official course, which is often not re-occupied.
In this case, there is no way to force the reoccupation, and there is no way to force the reoccupation of vehicles, and thus the fear that vehicle production could gradually be deducted from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world.

United States Warning Huawei
The head of the US Internet authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the federal government against trusting Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too big, "said Pai to the" Handelsblatt "with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security bodies..
Current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, "said FCC CEO, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of confidence" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" using its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible; the 5G technology is not just hardware:
This software consists of billions of lines of code that change over time, "says Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine," that a government authority, "wherever, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," said the FCC CEO.
He accuses the Chinese Huawei Group of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The company, which supposedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, "said Pai to the" Handelsblatt ".
The US had insights that government staff were placed within the company, and Pai recently for talks in Berlin to promote US position.

If you conclude an Internet contract do not blindly have to trust the speed data of the providers; customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
After all, the transmission rates promised in advance are a component of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities, such as the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them to the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to suppliers specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively calculated", says the Consumer Centre for Consumer Policy.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set the supplier a reasonable period of 14 days to make the promised service.
If this does not work even after several requests, customers may terminate and may claim damages, but if there is a lack of success, only the.,,,,,,.,,,,,,.,
First Transitional Republican for Investigation
As the first ranghoh Republican, the Governor of Vermont, voted in favour of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that goes from here, is determined by the facts that are found," said Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, for Trump watched "for years."
Republicans have so far resisted criticism of Trump for the whistleblower-level affair; few have revealed discomfort; Scott ’ s remarks are a first sign in Trump ’ s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as loosening environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.

Green Politician must answer for embarrassing photo panes
Elizabeth May, Chief of the Canadian Green, in the election campaign - was the reason why the cup was manipulated?
The Canadian founder holds a multi-way speaker in a photo, but now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - It has been left behind for a long time - and finally noticed that the reusable coffeemaker with metal roasting, Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Green, has never been kept in hand.
The Green Chief Response for Photo Panes
The National Post accused May of manipulation, and that the party produces fake news to appear more credible on environmental protection, in the middle of an election campaign in which Trudeau is increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and raised the discussion about fake news.
On the other hand, she said that it was only a matter of putting the party logo in the picture, and not to hide anything.
May writes that it is doing their suffering for the employee who has done it. "I do not want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardianund at the same time asks for something from her overcommitted team: "If they want to work a picture, could they not do what my face so that I look younger?"
The German Greens have also found themselves in Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or flight trips in Shitstorms - their pictures were not stoked.
Influencerin wants Free Upgrade: Live-long flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng had been promised to upgrade via mail from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
If you are looking for an upgrade for Business Class - many passengers dream of it, sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class for free.
This case shows how one should not do it: A self-declared influenza has actively asked for a free upgrade.
Jaqueline ’ s staff refused to upgrade, even though they presented an email claiming that Cathay Pacific Pacific to upgrade.
Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for long-haul flight, this time the woman was told to have the same mail, but with a different reference number.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific.
In her case, influenza turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her the price of her original ticket, Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: Cathay has committed fraud and remains closed for future flights.
Oil prices are according to Yemen's ceasefire report
On Friday afternoon, a barrel (159 litres) of North Sea harbor Brent $61.83 - about 1.4% less than the previous day.
The trigger for the Kursslide was a report by Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen, and Saudi Arabia is supposed to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil facilities brought to a halt to five% of world oil production. The Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country complained for the attacks.
If an agreement is actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand requirements, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Commodity Strategy Department at Saxo Bank of Bloomberg news agency.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to nearly $59, Brent nearly $65.
More recently, with insider insiders, that repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia are progressing faster than thought, following the attack in mid-September.
Most recently, press reports citing insiders reporting on rapid progress by Saudi Aramco ’ s oil company in repairs, but commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock market and avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero", more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recent release, the crew is preparing to leave, while the ship is still in front of the ship, shipowners Erik Hånell told Swedish radio on Friday morning.
But the US announced that it would move defensive missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia to Saudi Arabia. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom had temporarily pushed oil prices sharply in recent weeks.

North Korea ’ s Third Summits of Trump and Kim
North Korea has raised doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon be a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and success of such a meeting are questionable because of lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said Friday, according to KCNA.
The US would have done nothing to implement the summit ’ s decisions last year, said the North Korean State Department adviser, criticising tightening US sanctions and joint military manoeuvres of the US and South Korea, but he hopes for a "wise" and "courageous" decision to return to rapprochement.
On Monday, Trump said that he wanted to know what a third summit should bring before he agreed. Negotiations to disarm North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile programs have stalled since the failed second Trump summit in February in Hanoi in June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states, agreeing to revive the talks, but with no great success.

Doping: Other Russian manipulations.
Material from the Moscow analytical laboratory is being manipulated - confirmed by David Howman, the former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today ’ s Head of Integrity of the Athletics Association.
New details on the doping scandal in Russia are emerging – and they are destroying the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year, and even at some point. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports was revealed, and the Wada had banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years, during which time Russian athletes were not banned from the world stage.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada raised the Rusada Bann again, but called for access to the lab and the samples in question,,,.
However, the Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analyst laboratory. "Yes, we received the data nine months ago, and we should check whether the task force received the right data," David Howman said in the interview of Friday's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data that Wada from a whistleblower and those who received it in January from the Russians" Many positive findings that were mentioned in the McLaren Report.
Not affected the World Cup
This confirms the IAAF ’ s stance: The athletics Association is the only organisation holding the banner of Russia; 30 Russian athletes are in the World Cup in Doha, which had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
Earlier this week, Wada had already launched Wada manipulation and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks, and Russia is now threatening to withdraw the Rusada and, at worst, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
