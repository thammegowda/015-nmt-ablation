DFB ’ s leader Grindel sees no basis for Özil Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on having to talk to him about why he seems to have felt one or another, as laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the soccer podcast "phrase of the" Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regret the resignation of the 92-times national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
At some point, I assumed that this would be the case, "said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and explained that Grindel had not defended him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB boss reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared for a conversation with German trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build pressure, but he knows it from football in such a way that when 'you leave a team or change an association, you talk about it and I find it a pity that this conversation has not yet been concluded'.
Linz: Gartenhütte in Schrebergartensdlung
At 2.13 p.m. the professional fire station Linz was alarmed for a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage pipeline leads directly across the Schrebergartsettlement, danger was delayed.
The professional fire fighter stopped and found the hut in full fire.
The roof had to be completely removed and fire-booted to the extent necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut he had injected a battery at lunch.
That may be the source of fire.
In any case, according to fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined, as is the cause of fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectors items in his garden hut.

What Lohan has led to this action is completely unclear at the moment.

Audi: "Dieselgate" review lasts longer than planned.
"The diesel trap force still exists," said Development CEO Peter Mertens to the industry sheet "Automobilwoche".
Rupert Stadler ’ s detained and deported Audi CEO Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations are expected," he said then.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was established in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi MotoGP.
Mertens stressed that the car maker made 'serious organisational changes' so that such a scandal never recur.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Friday about Stadler ’ s future and wants to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values.
He knew of the manipulation or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, sales CEO Bram Schot is managing the company as Commissioner.
Due to the change to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there were production failures at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronn Voice".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
15,000 reservations were made for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel is going to be a member of the German Bundestag.
"I do my job and try to do it as good as it goes," said Grindel as a guest on the early Sunday morning at the ZDF's current Sportstudio.
We must always strive for re-election, and I shall do so.
And then you have to look at whether the support is there.
In his own words, the chief of association would be "strange" if, after the bid for the 2024 football championship, he did not want to be involved in the future project ".
Grindel has been the chief of association since April 2016 as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, overthrown over the summer fairy tale affair.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future Chief Executive Officer Philipp Lahm is to cooperate with the DFB Bureau.
'I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then of course be warmly invited to provide his experience in sporting matters, "said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB leader.
As a result of the incident surrounding the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that a national player with no immigrant background should become integration ambassadors of the DFB.
Currently, the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is no immigrant background influences society and football, and says that 'the issue is important, we have to take care," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work, "said Grindel.

Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends Rauswurf of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the robswurf of a journalist from Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor ’ s Office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had shifted a T-shirt with the Turkish and German label "Freedom for Journalists" and went into the front line.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was about disrupting the process of the press conference.
The action of the journalist gave rise to a great deal of unrest, which is unacceptable.
He has therefore led to the protection of the man.
Seibert said that it is not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
Turkey ’ s leaders blamed the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatening several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also unsure before the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel.
They were free and could return to Germany, but trials are still ongoing in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and good, Florian David Fitz.
We have to look at twice: yes, that is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller encounters with her guests on a variety of beer, some wine or even more alcoholic drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for compulsory singing.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your verdict" or "The Strange Day".
The Munich trip to the high north was not good at all.
On Saturday he postposta Selfie - his face is completely broken, his eyes only two small slices.
The bed-fie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful cat.
To his fans, he postulated some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: goes NIE to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black sau.
And Spritz.
And the round of Eierlicör, which melts by half three, also leave away.
Alcohol consumption is actually written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They range from instant breaks, fish crumbs or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoy the sight of the normally attractive cinema.
How Ina Müller survived the night suction camp is not known.
As she has moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to Combating Vandalism and Unrat
It is difficult to find and tired.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are scarcely emerging.
Scherben, cigarette dumps, rubbish and rubbish, demolished dustbin and now dismantled signs - this has been the starting point for a long time.
For the exemplary project of Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland offers a more than dishonest sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC community of Schwalmstadt but others have also been working for a longer time, according to the cyclist of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the wheel transport council.
There has been no solution.
The proposals range from the transfer of seats to regular discharges of waste containers and cleaning of the land at the entrance point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that they have also introduced the topic into the local advisory council.
Not only does the rubbish drive around cyclists and residents - the seat group is a regular meeting place on weekends.
It is not only often too loud, but the joints are also destroyed: posts are torn out of the earth, garbage bin demolished, shields are buried, shielded and seat furniture.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, said ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
You are annoyed that the Rastplatz on the bicycle path in Treysa is a meeting point for suction camps.
"Along the entire cycle path there is a clear focus here on the Haaße-Hill", confirms the cyclist, who is now also concerned about the new cycle center in goat hain, which is being opened today.
'If it makes the same fate, it becomes quite expensive '.
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps that will set the threshold is much higher than the threshold of interfering with common good.
This would, however, require a police action to pass in time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße-hill.
It must be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycling path can be very satisfied.
The marketing of tourism is still able to expand.
Our cycle path is very high compared to others in Germany, "says the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in Ascheröder Street in Treysa.
There is no bike ride on the Haaße Hill.
If there is a lot of traffic, cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of traffic flow, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but it is for older people and especially children.
Music Contest at the Culture Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake.
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and co-existence.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of Hiltrup "is the appeal of Hiltrup" in the "Musikcontest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A Contest "with a joke in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family relationship with coffee and cakes from the Ministry of Culture.
Seven formations began, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albachtener living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the Hiltruper Star Colors, three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland Kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, said, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What did the Texters link?
The towns of Hiltruper Lake and the market allee were particularly frequent.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue to the "Kö von Hiltrup" in his striking song.
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Time and again it was about experiencing coexistence in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints on their work.
He learned from Humberg that he had studied chemistry, but now teaching guitar.
Franke was able to report by the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann that the recently occurred in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest.
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on Youtube.
"It is not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury ’ s favourites – so that others can listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: He with his Hiltrup drummer, who impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all the children came up again for the finals - and even sounded "well" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, the intimacy of the melody and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from Wirtschaftsverbund and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The city ’ s offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: Decrypto in the Game etest
The players form two teams facing each other.
For each page there is a screen, there are four cards with keywords, which can be digitized - the old trick with the red foil - if you have inserted them.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.. in. in. in. in. in,,,.,
2.
3.
4. '
These are the terms that must be encrypted.
This is because it is not the terms but codes.
One player per team is the encoder.
He gets a code card that may be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should describe - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "dice", "feast" and "windows" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team if he succeeds in cracking the code twice.
So the encoder notes and reads loudly: "throwing" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to feast; here something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he watched in school and knows the window curz there.
This is the way round for round, team for team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can reconcile them with any hint that the encoder gives there.
Possibly mysterious but not too turned off should be the enrollment, otherwise you make it unnecessary for your team.
The most cryptic of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it for a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video on decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But those who have just started will be fascinated by how much sense is in this inconceivable game.
However, "Decrypto" is not quite as coherent as the predecessor and Genre-Primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent on a game less words but is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only concerned with advice and not winning points, can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Mann shows police Hitlergruß and harassing guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspectorate Kulmbach twice twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hitler's gruss in the Upper City of a passing police line, and later he also fell into a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he did not abide by the police, he had to spend the night in prison at the police inspectorate Kulmbach.
In a sober state, he must also be prosecuted because of the use of marks of unconstitutional organisations.
Pressig ’ s Home of Schubloks
The railway operation in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers caught up with buffers, it was heard in all Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the railway station.
That was not the cause of anyone.
Then the brakes and squeezed the wagons.
That was pure railway.
Statements that stand for Dinkel ’ s home of Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place by the railway.
Here was the starting point for the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which after an increase of about 220 altitude meters, has its point in Steinbach on the forest.
In order to cope with this, train and shopbloks were used in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station with 21 train boots, apprenticeship workshop, driving and train master.
"The heart was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and for 47 years.
The railway station (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated in 1968 Bamberg, also operated locs for the secondary routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalbhalben.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a workforce of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the 1939 route already minimized the need for train and shoe blocs.
From 1977 onwards they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 walls were placed in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were broken, and in 1991 the rest of the plant were broken in 1991.
Heidrich: 'It is regrettable that we did not envisage better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport.'
Even at Pfingsten 1989 the Nuremberg Railway Directorate of Nuremberg celebrated a pompous Bahnhofsfest in Pressig.
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic viewers here," Georg Dinkel remembers.
A little later on.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig ranking station was history.
"The Rangiers and inhibitors performed the most difficult work in train traffic," reminds Dinkel.
Any failure would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledonsique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have won the second round in Beijing.

Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He has been here since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as the main organizer and artist alike.
Something surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task into proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have contributed flyers.
This year again, on the occasion of art & enjoyment there is another 70-cent special poster brand designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn Exit", designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn welcomed the high acceptance of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg for the musical Umrahmung.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly becomes clear that the title "Windplay performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playful.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
At the entrance of the property the visitor on the right side of the "happiness tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, coloured, brightened, playful with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes.
With the sun shining through the bushwork, the object is soundly soundly sounded and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Washneck, which preferably dedicates to the event 15 years K & G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "Der Wind das heavenly Kind".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy creations of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for walking through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 Years MGV 68 albachts: Singers celebrate 50th birthday festive anniversary.
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachtists also made air their resentment at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia", there should be no sans life in the district.

The choral management of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the ink bush at the time.
"It is simply fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said: "He has such a light way, it is a masterpiece of performance he performs".
The "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly covers Evergreens from the 20s to the 1960s.
After all, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own Reime.
And Andreas Winterhoff presented fine poetry art.

This does not break our genius.
I saw good volleyball in some stages, ", Annacker did not get the 0: 3 - and immediately moved to the agenda.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became the star on the "Traumschiff".
In the episode of the episode "The Next Generation".
Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went off board forever.
The series she made her star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013) with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I was grown up with this work, travelled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues took me to meet me on equal terms, "says Keller in conversation with the" picture on Sunday ".
At first she had always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that has changed with the 'trauma ship'.
For now, journalists only appealed to Heide Keller.
"I do not know whether he liked it so well."
She considers it possible that her husband could have been envy, but "like many men, Hans was shy about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried to be the only right thing for Hans von Borsody "and he wanted to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have changed myself ', as she says.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, whom I never was, even though I sometimes appeared freak and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever '.
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time".
The day before the stand-alone wedding, I sat in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and.
Why never worked with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at that time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday life.
I have gone far too naive to love '.
The night folder who regularly explores the night life of the city in the NZZ resort Zurich, has dared to the ZFF opening party.
Our wrist is not a mot, but a little light.
And the sheer glory in which a green carpet has dipped on the Six-Column Square, fades it excessively.
But it is a film festival, more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So he torches over the square on this late Thursday evening in order to make himself easier in the Aquaclean-WC Oasis.
The public toilet facility, sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the needing place in the ground of a new pavilion is making great effort to evade a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it's in the Herren-Oasis is stinging to heaven for some reason.
So out here, go to the other side of the street: Loved guests, who have just entertained at the best level in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book", celebrate as every year with a party in the three-storey shop.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as you know, the works shown from all over the globe.
What does not have to be imagined in an article about this festival in order to avoid falling into abyss for its 190 partner companies.
The folder binds a bench around the feet, which has given him a good fairy tale, and two bulky towers are actually waving him in generously.
In the evening, they dance to live music far after midnight or can be used by DJ rhythms to which they attack each other, and rinse down exquisite tapes with Cüpli.
In the delicatello shop in the souterrain, oysters are waiting for slewing mouth, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate foun..,,,,.,....,....
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves of full exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so seems to work without big losses.
We must love this country.
The Falter studies the shield at the staircase: "wear a long dress, please be careful on the staircase".
If these are two separate instructions, he has lost in the dress code.
But it is more a conditionality structure, and it has certainly saved life.
In the household section on the upper floor the poultry kippers a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not guaranteed by this mix that a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been advocating this brand for years, is not here either.
But there is a face, between local drunk, cascade and kitchen articles, a face that the observer knows: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor will not be far away.
And really: Right Viggo murders, with almost sixty almost like a choir boy, through the crowd.
It is not being asked, nor is it possible to shoot.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as a narrative, international stars of this film festival.

Argentina ’ s football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home, Mexico.

Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Sending after last minute bankruptcy 'destroyed' on the ground 'destroyed' '.
Swen Bieletzki, Coach of the handball association ASV Senden, could hardly imagine: "So a bitter defeat".
As in Steinhagen, as in Steinhagen, and in the case of Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods.
Only the initial phase "we have completely disappeared", the ASV trainer.
Shortly, the housekeepers ran at 8: 1, even the early departure that Bieletzki had taken did not produce.
"But then a rush went through a team," Bieletzki summed the second quarter of an hour.
For pause, the backlog was only two goals.
Especially Senden best, Marius Hintze, met another time in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from visitors ’ point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst compared to 15: 15, then the batch changer ran almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Get the impartial into action.
Bieletzki is usually wary of trying to blame others.
But: The 120-person time sentence that Steffen Mühlhoff casted was "a joke".
LIT had laughed well and met four times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys fought a great deal, stood well against seven men at the back and thrown on the empty gate.
But they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now has to be a damned victory", according to Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent withdrawal as head of the billionaire company.
He and the US Securities Exchange Supervisor, SEC, brought a litigation over misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million per year, and Musk is leaving Chairman for three years, a similar position to the German Supervisory Board.
He may remain the head of the Executive Board.
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct in the comparison, which must be confirmed by a court.
The SEC had prosecuted the world-famous manager in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss of electric car pioneer, who is now valued at more than $50 billion.
Musk is Unaware of Musk
Musk said that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, and finance was secured.
This would have valued Tesla at $72 billion.
Musk later ruined: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a foreign-born chairman, appoint two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk ’ s communication.

Surveys: 46% do not want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
After the crossings of the past few weeks, GroKo collects several surveys.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid-Sunday trend for the first time in Germany.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one meter to 17 percent, and the SPD points compared to the previous week and ends at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27%.
That is the lowest value so far for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15%, the left 11, and the FDP 10%.
If the federal election on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU, and CSU would win only 43% of the vote.
The grand coalition has thus lost the majority on Sunday issue in all major research institutes - except Allensbach.
The ruling parties reach 43 to 45% of the vote (Allensbach: 51%).
In the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4%.
For other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, the second-strongest party in several polls, comes from 15 to 18%.
The Greens win votes from 12.5 to 17%.
The left stands at an average of 10%, and the FDP is 9%.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of between 2 and 3%, depending on the share of the vote.
But popular support for German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also declined sharply since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48% of citizens still find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellor ’ s office, as the Emnid poll on behalf of the BamS.
Only one in two (50%), according to the survey, wants the grand coalition to believe in three years by the next regular federal election, and 41% are in favour of re-election.
In a further poll published on Saturday, Merkel saw a significant loss of popularity.
The Germans also judge whether Merkel should stand again for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
Therefore, 64% would like to have a candidate for membership, 35% not.
Aldi ’ s Outside: Price reduced to Love Happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
If you say that in times of Tinder there are no longer any romantic connoisseurs - you should talk about pute meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food Datings" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket now radiates an anachronistic romance for great love.
Yes, a conversation about reduced pute meat, boxershort bargains at the table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
App Tinder stands out for being less a contact, but rather a slippery exchange.
We dared the test: how do women react, not to talk about the bush in the first news?
Here is the astonishing result.
Normal Hollywood -Lovestory potential is when love is preceded by an out-of-sight and lost plot.
If the type is registered at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch @ gmx.de, it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, the author of this Annonce in an aldi, unknown to us, is certainly to hope that she will find her mother with whom she has talked about the "30% reduced bioPutenmeat".
To believe in the magic of analogue connoisseurs, she has definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood.

Football: District liga: Researchers appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrhein Maggiore
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard to court with his own.
Wortkarg was a member of the National League of Nations.
All history.
In the meantime it runs around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer proof is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrhein, in the past game time only at the ascent.
Yes, I am very pleased with the appearance.
"We have made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen ", Fetsch praised his boys and looked for each individual for the game, just to say" thank you "for so much counter to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg - went almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front front front line.
Wolbeck had much more of the game in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his departure (17), the chanted Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38) missed the lead.
This would almost have sounded when the SCA in minute 41 in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer, the SCA took a dangerous step in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL wrongly took full control.
At the end of 18 meters failed just.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entry.
With the intervention of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed a fresh cell appearance.
When Altenrhein Chris Naberbäumer died in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect release for the placeholder 18 meters before the guest house.
The Gefoulte came up itself and demonstrated its dangers in standards.
Westhues "Thing with the right slap struck the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1: 0 (71).
20 minutes, which should be damned.
And then: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew his hand in the 80th minute.
Arbitration Huseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately showed the point.
Jannis Schneider did not escape the gift (79th).
Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase, before Geske had to survive in the eighth minute before Geske had the winner on the Pu.
Would perhaps have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes (6th) - The,. in. in in., in.,,.,,, in., in in..,,.. in in.

Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on corporate boards
As a result, only 8% of the Board of Directors were women at the end of 1 September, as stated in the report entitled "The Power of Monoculture", which was officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to set themselves differently, otherwise international competitors will miss them," said Founding Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom, or Sweden, only male executive teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It is another corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was due solely to positive impulses for the companies in the mid-sized index index (MDax).
According to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, the figure was still 3.8%.
In the 30 Dax companies - in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Last but not least, 26 women worked at the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistently next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled not to commit any commitment, increasing the proportion of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges from the supervisory boards: as of 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than they were a year ago.
"If there were as many women recruited for the boards each year, a share of 40 percent in 2023," says the report.
Some even make miese: luxury cups: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?

This question was about "autopaper" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made 69,000 euros in operating profit - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, and in the first half of the year.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros before interest and taxes.

VW ’ s core brand is missing: Paris automobile salon in the wake of the diesel debate in...........
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject but ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the fight for driving bans and retrofitting is unlikely to leave German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week, they will show their novelties in the French capital.
Diesel no longer plays a major role in this..
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which until then will still be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the shining scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models: The Ingolstadt e-tron is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
But both were officially presented.
The iNext of BMW should only start in 2021.
The new 3s will focus on Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October..,,,.,,.,,.,
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in their own halls.
The exhibition, which celebrates its 120th birthday, takes place every two years in exchange with IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, about one million visitors came.
During the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people have died on Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had the strength of 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, causing enormous damage.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu hundreds gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the numbers of victims are still going to rise significantly.
The figures have so far only come from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along Sulawesis west coast.
About 150 Bikers are celebrating worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final god service for motorcyclists in the peace church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The place in front of the peace church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final god service for the bikers was on the programme.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the mental concerns of the PS-strong two-wheel riders.
The traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle between April and September.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season at the Peace Church in Eveking.
About 150 bikers met there on Sunday in order to do anything but ordinary worship.
As early as 10 o'clock, the Bolides were mounted in front of the church entrance gate.
First the biker soap was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or with a genuine currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were included.
The parish held during the Biker service priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical underscores.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill beats rather poetic-quiet sounds", says parish Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service.
Fertiling Homeland Association celebrates great celebration: after the apple comes milk after the apple.
Borisch was also active during the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple cakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his astonishing audience step by step the process from the mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to children and let them fill the apples in the great funerals.
With a little muscle force, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how this should become a tasty drink.
However, they were also able to look at this important step in this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in forms and enclosed by networks, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer by layer for layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran gradually into a large vessel.
But the farmer farmer had already completed specialties.
He opened his "treasure box" and presented to the older visitors the latest spring white.
The demand for a good drop of "Made in foil" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple presses, but also discovered the built refuge for themselves.
Also active members of the fodder comrades of former soldiers were involved in the course of the festival and invited to play short games at several stations.
Next year, the Homeland Association will offer an action day.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home house will not be the place of action in the heart of the Savings Act.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the subject: after all, milk will then be around.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth seasonal bankruptcy: 'Weissene Situation' '
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappoint professionals of Hannover 96 around him and spoke to them courage.
However, there were many positive things before the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It is a cautious situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and shouted: "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a great deal '.
The further vicious Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86th) joined, stand at the bottom with two meters and are a candidate country in their current constitution.
Led by the superior Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) and Luka Jovic (89th) reached 46,300 spectators in the middle of the table.
Croatia ’ s vice-champion Rebic was almost involved in every dangerous offensive by the Hessen and never managed to get control of Hanover.
The protracted storms long after the World Cup showed why it is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was born from FC Liverpool, was the first time in the early formation of Frankfurt, which began swi.
Lucas Torró (17), which was deposited on the Tor network, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stunned in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defender Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back).
Leaders fell almost inevitable and entirely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defensive corner into the penal area, Haller extended per head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga meeting for the defensive player won by the French second league, AJ Auxerre in..,,,,. in.,,, in.
And Frankfurt did even before the break.
This time Haller adapted to his Sturmpartner Rebic, who had skilfully and failed failed to give 96-torwart Michael Esser a chance.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiterated the weak performance of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a little bolder forward, but ignited ideas remained until the end of the track.
The Hesses were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then put across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only running for the Frankfurt against overcrowded guests, even Jovic met one minute before the end.

Violsing: Violence Christians celebrate Holy Cross
The violinist Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross on 14 September or on Sunday after.
The festivity service takes place in the city church and then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the closing session.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shocked Christ, which dates from the 30 year old war and on which a Swedish soldier is supposed to have shot.
Blood then went out of the shot.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shocked Christ, which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
It has not been finished to this day, but only the altar is standing, the missing long-house is indicated by the trees.
In his parish, Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
In spite of the importance for the Geisinger parish was badly attended.
After the divine service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the Cross.
For many years the Catholic church choir has invited to the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish.
The choral members provided the visitors with hearty dishes as well as a wide selection of cakes and the weather.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors about the damage to façade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the construction measures that will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding for some time, the damage could be more accurately identified and the individual tenders were prepared to be more specific.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existed a few years ago, but more has also been discovered, which has only been made possible by using scaffolding.
The socket plaster work has been completed, the natural stone works are to be started before winter and one hopes to finish half of this year.
Opening: New residential home in Neu-Ulmer Münsterstrasse
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new residential home for people with disabilities.
The fact that, in Münsterblick, 'a very special house' is now being handed over to its provision - there were all agreed at the opening hour.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the home of the Donau-Iller for some time now have to rely on the special architecture of the new building.
Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account broader corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was tested for the residents with Handycap: "The house had come into the years and no longer in the equipment," said Bader retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators moved to tear the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Donau-Iller Opens New Home
About 4.6 million euros invested in life aid in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work remained within the planned framework - both time and financial.
The Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagate between a barrier free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
However, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many presets that would allow the inhabitants to be able to move without foreign help.
In the same way, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants who need tools to be mobile".
The combination of living and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And again: "The property in this situation is a real happiness because it is no longer to be acquired in the current situation '.
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblick Straße offers space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three residential groups.
Life-Managing Director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Sweetly laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the deputy president of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germany.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern" on Sunday ".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable for East German to work longer on average than the people in West Germany, but they should receive 15% less.
"I cannot explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this putty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan hunting lodge is intended to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dog.
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday, the two dogs reached their recipients on Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to 'facilitate reconciliation'.
The dogs with the thick white coat, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the goodwill at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
In doing so, both countries agreed to join in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games, and jointly apply for the 2032 Olympic Games.
As a reciprocal rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missi.
Austria ’ s Story of 99 documents
What is Austria?
The 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemoration for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director-General of the Austrian State Archive, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New Week, New Opportunity for the Government
Returning to the material work, this is the unofficial motto of the grand coalition ’ s working week.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have recently summed up the "return to work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, casierers and other working citizens in that country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and material work, but it is.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its mandate - governance - it should not be discouraged by debate about concepts.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and blasphemy of recent weeks will probably be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties gather together for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First, however, conflict-related issues are again on the agenda with diesel retrofitting and the law on law on immigration.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange-premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in an obligation to upgrade older diesel.
While there has been an approximation in the diesel crisis throughout the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned specialist immigration law.
The SPD calls for a lead view for rejected asylum seekers who work or are training.
The Union is strongly opposed to 'change of track' from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will be disputes between the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
It is not equal and equal to GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without a dispute, a society characterised by such diverse interests, sometimes contradictory interests does not make progress.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be reopened for partisan tactical reasons.
It is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD should argue, but always look at the real life of the people.
What is feasible and benefits many?
This key issue can be addressed pragmatically to clarify both the diesel and track change issues - and thus regain confidence.
That is what the grassroots parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Target Minister
Is the Labour Minister of Labour against the current law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at this more closely.
"Really day and night" their legists had worked on social security reform, a superfluous social minister reported at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) comes as a surprise - she brings the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumes that 'the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the commitment of her team and not to declare infringements of current service law in front of cameras'.
Nevertheless, they now have questions to be able to "free" from any suspicion ".
Police is taking up a street in search of Women ’ s Lights............
MarxGrün - The police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning we dig on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed until Monday in the Marxgrün area.
It was predicted that the investigators had previously used an archaeology store.
The dog, especially trained for the smell of old human bones, was able to limit the relevant place to a few metres.
In addition, soil anomaly has been discovered, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of.
For more than a year, Public Prosecutor's Office and Criminal Police Court have been working on the missing case.
A cycle path has been closed at Marxgrün and investigated with sonars, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body might have been tended here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colouring powders and eggs in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary of Catalonia ’............
On Monday, the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But riots are already taking place.
The separatists did not forget the police operation of the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 officials from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year in the polling stations that were considered illegal.
In trying to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at that time..
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the 6000 separatists would then have been using force to break the police chain and put the officials with colour bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, they were told by the authorities.
On Monday, the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid imposed Catalonia in the fall of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement continue to be held in U-detention..,, in,..,,..,,
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan Government took office in May, the forced administration ended.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the Catalans' right to self-determination '.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Versammelte Inciency: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen Separate Torlos
Red and white Ahlen is still on the spot.
At the FC Gütersloh, too, it was only a 0: 0 draw.
In front of 438 viewers in Heidewaldstadion, the final light and the third last showed them as a conquered impunity.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who would prefer to get a beer or a bratwurst could do this safely.
There was no risk of missing a chance, because there was virtually none.
First Shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) kick of the entire game.
The best - and in principle even true - possibility was the Ahlener when Cihan Yilmaz FCG Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the ceiling.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged, for him Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Motzel of 18 metres just above the housing and after an hour the freight sloters also appeared offensive for the first time.
After a conquest of Matthaew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
"Nick Flock (62nd) with a slight shot in the arms of RWA Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they performed with a headball from Wieckowicz (66th) after a pitch of former Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA Interimstrainer Angelo Daut, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Motzel (70).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahlener did not come about.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did it.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero was also at the front.
"This time we were not as torthreatening as we were against woodwrapping and that although our opponent had no desire to play here," RW Ahlens Interimstrainer.
Offensive "everything so called a bit" against a team that only wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not feel that we could get another door, "says Daut.
However, as a spectator did not feel that his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too weak for this.
Reckenfelder Harvest Market: Luckily there are enough chalkers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Panel for which these donations are intended.
The honorary officials assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening of the sky was bright blue, but the space was still slightly empty, but this should change during the day.
"This is so nice sociable here, so we are here today," said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit with a proper prise of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who was supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there are enough chalets.
And the "replacement" could not be taken to entertain the ever growing visitors in the meantime.
This was so good that at late hour some folk songs were sung.
"Simply great", Marcel Kreimer enjoyed.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased about the many active players with their booths, mostly clubs.
"In fact, there should be no such thing as a plate," he thanked for the action of the Männerchor.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those in use at the stands and also included the other festivities and the Clean up action that took place in September.
Our garden town has a colorful painting - here is what goes.
Then the Maikranz of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klpiece was removed with the help of the fire brigade.
Many booths have been working on many booths.
From sweetness to heart, everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decupiers.
Furnishing, beer lid with clay fields motifs and a lot more.
Three Reckenfelder Imker: "Reckenfelder Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a speciality.
Honey cakes in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little elsa had to access again and again.
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to stay long until the evening hours, even without a stage programme which does not exist at the Herbstfest.
Blacksmithing shops with a local message: no successful advertising for skateboarding installations.............
In Lengerich, unknown unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate plant in Lengerich.
In several places there are appropriate lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne from the City Administration on request of WN.
In at least one case, the police have been prosecuted for material damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" on signs, among others, the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, Manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding font had been discovered on the advertising sign on the staircase at the staircase of the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message was apparently "only" with an Edding, it was possible to remove it easily.
"A few days later this was there again, this time sprayed", says Rottmann.
He assumes that the relevant advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given precisely this case by the fact that several large firms from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the skatepark is built, the realization of this project will also be made possible by sponsors.
Promises are already made, explained Jörg Hesselmann of the urban field of school, sport and culture, without name.
Well possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the covered table.
Local policy and administration have been dealing with skating equipment for years.
After the old at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The majority of the Council was in favour of fire-fighting parking.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors seem to have spoken against building at this point.
At the end of June, a U-turn followed.
The members of the main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word is the City Council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Bottdown on Air Traffic Making Worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm," said the chief of the trade union of Air Security, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known staffing difficulties in European air traffic controllers, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Across Europe, the market for ready trained pilots is empty.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various air trade unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the federal, the countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports gather in the Hanseatic City to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional compression and overtime, this will not be done without us," explained the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German Air Security Council.
Maas was once again responsible for the pilotage misery.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings in national air traffic control are now fully focused on operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not keep air traffic control.
At present, EU requirements would be voted by 2024 and there would be further tightening.
The EU has been subjected to constant pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high delays in the airlines will lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offer a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas said..
The recording of 120 piloters per year over the next five years, which has been announced to date, is enough to compensate for age-related outages.
The necessary staffing is not yet associated with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group Renewal
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the restructuring plans.
According to the wishes of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at Sunday's meeting, the crisis is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies should be based in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff than already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the control body counts only eight heads on the capital side.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, 50% of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
The second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG is to bundle the business of elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: violence in demos of police and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with many injured.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain met on Saturday, as well as some 6000 advocates of independence.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protests out of each other.
However, according to the forces of independence tried repeatedly to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked officials with colour and scoops.
According to the figures, there were also some of the participants of the various protest trains.
According to the rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police said that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
In their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to those colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, opposed the Spanish Central Government's independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Spanish police and the Civil Guard feel it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona, of course.
"Why did they come here to protest?", the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez asked AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and to celebrate the fact that they have obscured us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands who wanted to name only Daniel, rejected the charge.
"Of course we want to support our comrades, who last year only did their duty: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because this is a great European city and there is more response here.
But he and his colleagues were "not coming to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data from British ministers
A mobile phone security vulnerability has led to temporary access to personal data from ministers and Conservative UK Tory Party officials temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the breakdown became known one day before the Tory Party Congress in Birmingham.

Two people died when they drove a tree by their car.

Soccer: Juve Trainer praises for top score: Ronaldo ’ s Best Game
The Portuguese star Todd "played the best game together with half an hour of Valencia," Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3: 1 (1: 1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive purchased star was the decisive man in the important match against the persecutors.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and makes it good," said Allegri.
Although we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and we grew from the moment onwards.
Thanks to Ronaldo ’ s three goals, Juve turned the game by Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst persecutor for the time.,,.,,.,,,.. in..,.
The Torhunter, brought by Real Madrid, first of the former Bundesliga professional, Mario Mandzukic, who led with a double pack (26 / 49).

Created!
Hoetmars coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simply more manageable, we have never posed him with problems ", so thin the list of Hoetmar slips.
Grade times two goals in 90 minutes, so it is rare to make games positive.
A1 football league: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
Even the SG had only two possibilities in the first round, the first but used Maik Krause from sharp angles to early leadership (7).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preparatory work by Krause, he moved freely.
The hosts had only a double option when Moritz Höne failed to Torsteher Jos shoemaker, and in Jan Blome also found his master in Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all gave.
A trade-meter - Louis Kortenjann had rescued on the gate and saw red - Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75).

However, he could laugh: "A dreadful victory," he said, coerced freak and drew from thanks to his players, the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
It is worth noting that after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely albachts, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for the class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked at the 90 minutes behind him.

It is all the more bitter that you have to go home with empty hands.
Top Torjäger Lars Zymner took the host with his 12th season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2: 0 he put on the left side as exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew this, but it is not possible to take a player completely.
"That was madness of what he did," Lewandowski invariably recognized the opponent's quality.
Shortly before the side change, his own eleven achieved the balance: McGill ’ s release sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia Toreck Hinkerohe through to the long Toreck (45).
After the change of the page it was McGill who achieved the balance (59).
Then it went and forth.
It was a tough, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked albachts again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Despite the fact that Albersloh failed to meet the last Concordia hits (80).
We must now focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against scams, that is what we must now win," said Lewandowski.

"The musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the church of Wolbeck.
As cabarettestin devised the gender understanding, not only with humor and heart warmth for the (felt) woman and what else might be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used her and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
This is one of the male Sparring partners who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, and on the other is a true pianist: so congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some might have liked a solo.
It was also true, with Beethoven and Chopin, but otherwise, in other words, as it did with the Red thread of the evening.
Teubner had put a paradox: the satisfaction of man comes when he has a partner, but he does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner does not benefit.
The piano artist now demonstrates the same thing: What would be the result of Mozart's composing would have "the Nannerl" opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus Süverkrüp slides into improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Lied von Tod", and from Mozart g-Moll Symphony into a played dancing.
There were great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, Treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.

From pure fruit to Ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year existence of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege.
On September 29, 1893, the last founding impulse for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle.
In 1893, he was appointed as a "district obstbauverein Kulmbach City and Land" district obstbauverein Kulmbach City and Land "," "".
The purpose of the fruit tree was also different from today's work - it was really about fruit growing, and nobody thought about flowers and gardening.
"At that time, in the Enlightenment era, the fruit tree was a favorite of the elites," said district nursery Günter Dippold in his firm.
The fruit trees should be bordered on roads, and schools have developed industrial gardens.
The fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, which comprise nearly 7000 members.
But that is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village enhancement and nutrition play an important role as communicating knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Maulwürfe" were entertaining on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed especially in the digital age," said said the district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge matter for us children, I doubt that Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides", supplemented Landrat Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the gardens for the villages.
The association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county councillor Friedhelm Haun did not have any doubt.
He led the many visitors with an image presentation through the long history of the district association and reported among other things about the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for winter it was used.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature lasts, it was there before us and we must be guided by it," the expert for fruit and nut trees.
For this reason, there is an incentive for horticultural associations not to let down, so that our homeland remains beautiful and valuable.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our clubs, supplemented by the President of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe this to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower shops of the Thurnau Music Association.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a trade show, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
In early September, the politician was attacked on the open street during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not"), women's associations called for protests against the former military.
In the social networks, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and disregard for women.
In the economic metropolis of São Paulo, several thousand protesters were expected.
In Brazil ’ s capital, the protests mixed with a rally of Brazil ’ s Workers Party (PT) presidential candidate, Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and therefore cannot stand.
Brazil's presidential election is 7 October.
As former mayor of São Paulo, Haddad has been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieves an absolute majority in the first round, there will be a run-off vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from this - no matter whom he will compete.
Bolsonaro is known for fighting homosexuals and black and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Time and again, he shocks with verbal aberrations.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula ’ s left-wing Workers Party should be shot.

Trump blames Kim: "And then we fell in love."
It is no secret that North Korea ’ s leader Kim, is well disposed of, despite a nuclear crisis.
But Trump has now made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become a new flame.
The tragedy: it is a distant relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Before supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tenacious words for the half-old Pyongyang Pyongyang ruler dynasty, though the battle for North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament proves to be rather tough.
"I was tough, he also, and it went between us," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only talks with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote to me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump pointed to the end of all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have seen little more than lip service.
The US president was well aware that the affection for whether his martial threatening "Rocket Man," Trump's nickname for Kim, would not be hurting everyone.
In any case, he immediately took the expected criticism of this at a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How terrible is this, how terrible is this?
That is so unpresidential.
But do not care for him, Trump explained, and then turned his finger on the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential".

Saved Refugees from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya using a mobile phone video, enabling them to be saved.
The group had shot and spread online in its cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who took the video, AFP news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya when trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he claimed to be in danger of life.
One of his fellow fighters was almost beaten by the warriors, Onyeka.
Generally, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: 'They beat us all with pipes and sticks'.
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the bar.
The IOM organises voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homes this year through the program, said IOM speaker in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.

He has not heard of a call for help via mobile video.

He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again emphasized the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.

A lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump does not tire tired of emphasizing the success of the negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea ’ s Secretary of State Ri Yong Ho, accused the US administration of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
"The recent deadlock is because the US is based on coercive measures that are lethal for confidence building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way for us to disarm ourselves as the first," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
That punitive measures might force North Korea on its knees' is a dream of people who do not know us'.
But to build confidence, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, there have been no 'response from the US side, the minister criticized.
Last year alone, because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council adopted three times last year alone.

After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is to return to Pyongyang for talks about ending North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons program.

But then, on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: a power failure had abandoned the huge two-part refrigerator, the food was wounded and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start from scratch: we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and adolescents wanted to do it alone," Westbuer...
And so everyone packed with.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"It is not better for chefs," a visitor impressed while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served, or guests were allowed to use quiiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and adolescents have put on their feet", emphasized parish Frank Beckmann, while wizard Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other pieces of art.

Hertha ’ s Pleite: Captured by Reality: Bavaria versus Ajax Requirem.,,, in..,,, in..,,,, in..,
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin does not want to let the FC Bayern ".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach will now determine the first intermediate stage for Niko Kovac.
The first small performance model under the new Coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase itself to a greater hereditary low for Munich.
"A week ago we had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we got a bit of reality ", Thomas Müller said after the 0: 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions-League-Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us will know that this is really annoying us and that is why we are sending gas to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, there were two mandatory games in series without victory, the table management in the football league.
While the overall situation is far from as dramatic as it was the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its running intensive mann-versu-man tactics and the Berliner through their playful needle sticks over the outside, delivered two blueprints, as the last overpowering Bavaria.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we will not like this and we will do everything we can to succeed again," said Kovac.
However, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his birthplace, and defeated his first defeat as Munich Coach only to the once again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim term of his term in office. Otherwise, the tone is likely to get worse.
For example, Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second royal class appearance of this season after the 2: 0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, the short preparation for the second pre-round game against Ajax, which also had a sovereign victory at 3: 0 at the start of AEK Athens.
"Now we have caught us in two games, but we will also make our gates again," announced the national team chapter Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost Cup against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke very clearly.,,,,.
The right-wing defender appeared as a memorial.
"I don't think that this is all bad, we have to work out it again because we don't make the multitude of opportunities and make mistakes behind the back," stressed the 23-year-old girl just before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavarian even had five meters behind Dortmund, which has now taken over the top with one point.
And so Kimmich, with a blind eye to the fact that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, this is good," said the national player.
It is good for the league.

Grindel pointed to Gündogan ’ s statement that he felt "sensibly treated the DFB" in contrast to Özil after the World Cup affair, which began by photos of both with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not acceptable.

We should have defended Mesut more, as I have always said.
He does not see any basis for a return to the national team.
As a result, an additional integration officer will be appointed alongside the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is no immigrant background influences society and football, and says:" The issue is important, we have to take care, "it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work," said Grindel..

The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be taken only with the express consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.

A similar registration system exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations of storing information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Office for Health Enlightenment, Marita Völker-Albert says.

According to his proposal, everyone would be regarded as donor of organs, unless he or her members.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.

After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesians talk about SItuation on the ground
The local Radia Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Have you been on site during the tsunami?
No, I was at that time in Jakarta, on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me that she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately moved back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport at Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our World Vision office has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi?
Many have moved to surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many food stores and petrol stations are completely closed, people sometimes look for food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down and the national government is helping.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are sometimes circulating freely and searching for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information on the island?
At the moment we have handycatches, but this did not work and we only got information from the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who do not know whether they live and where they are residing, because people were not at home, but on work during the earthquakes.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the spark came, many thought 'Okay, not tsunami' - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami is hitting the region and are stretched to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Fire Ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but that was the worst here.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and train evacuation.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake hit a great many people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Investigation in Turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at the Turbotempo, Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the ultra-thin majority for the controversial judge, Brett Kavanaugh, who was contested for claims.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents over 30 years ago.
The recent change in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's vocation, which was accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer ran angry Tirades against opposition democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his initial announcement that he would agree, but demand an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the serious allegations on Thursday as a 'complain', initially contained further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of 'happiness in disaster'.
In this way, last doubts could be resolved, he said.
Later, in an election rallied, Trump attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy."

FC Schalke 04 after the victory against Mainz: Fear arose Fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on shake is great after the first season victory.
However, the time factor played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball inside.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penal room, "said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the royal blue had yet managed to finish the scarce 1: 0 against the Rhine hessen over time and thus the first season victory.
In fact, things could have happened otherwise.,,..,,.,.,,
After the leadership of Alessandro Creator 11 had given the team of chief trainer Domenico Tedesco security, Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and pressing".
Creating No Headball-Monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand that '.
The boys were afraid to leave this out of their hands and therefore withdrew.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We have all fallen a huge stone from our hearts," said Creator, who did not have an insignificant share in it: "I am actually the worst headball player in the managerial".
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, including Tedesco.
"We wanted to start printfully and make a fireworks from it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
At last we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calm and courageous, so we have to tackle games for over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest shortfall of the afternoon: King blue missed it to worry for clearer circumstances.
The possibilities were there, for example, by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the Latte twice 59th / 72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have become a quotation victory," Tedesco said: "You have already felt fear a bit".
I am therefore pleased that we have won.
He was not the only shaker.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on equal footing
This is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has again followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it the task of bringing interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the Reckenfelder Meeting "- the association that cooperates with the Alliance" Cultural Policy "in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani arrives very loosely into reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in understandable terms.
With a lot of gesture, solid figures and one joke or another, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting themes: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, conflicts arise?
The Syrian author uses to answer the question of a metaphor.
German society, first generation migrants at the cats table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to play a part.
This leads to conflict.
What is crucial, then, is not whether one should be aligned politically on the right or left, but: "am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first, rather behaving, the discussion round begins.
There is also a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or not successful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is on stage, not on stage, a symbol of discussion: it is on equal terms.
The sociology professor does not press his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of average, not individual destiny.
He is pleased that there is an interest in this issue, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing hour he was still open to the questions of guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities.

Not for the third time in a row: Naldo thanks to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalker Startelf but at the exchanger bench, it would have been great for many people if the Brazilian nearly two meters tall had really spoken the frustration of the soul.
