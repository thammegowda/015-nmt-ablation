But he is not sick , he has only a powerful cater .	-3.2859
At his fans he wrote some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now won : " Rule one : goes NIE to Inas night .	-6.4703
Normally two : never trinks the black suction .	-2.6174
And syringe .	-1.8963
And the round of Eierlikör , which Ina forgets about half three , also leave away .	-6.0529
Alcohol consumption is truly on the face of the 43-year-old .	-3.3309
His fans sent a few tips on how to combat the aftermath .	-6.1874
They were rich in instantbrosis , fish crumbs , or - presumably the most targeted - headache tablets .	-6.7836
Others simply amused themselves with the sight of the normally attractive cinema stage .	-7.8198
As Ina Müller has survived the night suction store , it has not yet been known .	-5.8252
Since they have moderated the TV fun at the counter but already since 2007 , the 53-year-old seems to be much more proven ...	-5.7075
A beer with Ina Müller .	-1.6827
Treysa has to contend with vandalism and betrayal .	-3.3317
The entry into the 36 km long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tiring .	-5.7041
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought , but solutions are hardly emerging .	-4.3243
Scherben , Zigarettenkippen , Müll und Unrat , demolierte Mülleimer und mittlerweile demontierte Hinweisschilder - so präsentiert sich seit Längerem der Einstieg mit Sitzgruppe zum Radweg auf dem Haaße-Hügel in Treysa .	-2.7737
For the flagship project Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland a more than unbelievable sight .	-5.3717
The topic is occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt , but other members of the Radverkehrsbeauftragte der Stadt Ulrich Wüstenhagen have been working on this . , , , , and . .	-10.1338
The problem has already been raised in the Committee on Transport and Tourism .	-2.8834
There is no solution so far .	-2.7284
The proposals range from the transfer of the seat group to regular emptying of waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point .	-6.7488
" I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities " , says Wüstenhagen .	-4.1552
Guido Hahn ( ADFC ) reports that the topic has also been submitted to the local council .	-3.9070
Not only the rubbish drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for parties at weekends .	-4.9059
It is not only too frequent to say that the yellow is also destroyed : posts from the ground , dustbin demolished , nickten sign , seat furniture smelled .	-10.5473
Volunteers would have cleaned up already more frequently , narrated ADFC member Susanne Klippert .	-4.0305
The actions , however , are just the proverbial drop in the ocean .	-3.5777
The Rastplatz on the cycling trail in Treysa is a meeting place for saufgelage .	-6.8440
" Along the entire cycle path , here at the Haaße Hill , there is a clear emphasis on " , the traffic controller , who now also cares about the new radar station in Ziegenhain , which is opened today .	-8.8990
" Relieves them the same fate , it becomes really expensive " .	-3.8571
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill : " The threshold may be significantly higher to pick up on the common good .	-5.2228
This would , however , presuppose that a police strike would then be timely .	-5.5060
In principle , Mrs Wüstenhagen wants the Haaße hill to develop .	-4.0843
It must be made more attractive .	-1.3765
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the wheel path so far .	-5.4355
Tourist marketing is still capable of expansion .	-4.3495
Our cycling path is very high quality compared to other cycling routes in Germany , " said the ADFC members .	-5.2702
As a highly critical danger source , ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa .	-4.3436
There is no Abbiegespur on the Haaße hill .	-3.2197
In case of rain traffic , cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the road , " she explains .	-5.6157

This contest , according to Mayor Joachim Schmidt , was a novelty .	-3.2479
We have not seen this in other parts of the city .	-2.9677
What did the text look like ?	-2.6871
In places , the Hiltruper Lake and the Market alley have often been mentioned .	-5.6458
Rolf Ihmig arbitrary the avenue in his striking song to " Kö von Hiltrup " .	-4.0585
The cultural station was also appreciated .	-4.3030
Again and again it was about the experience of coexistence in these places , especially at Alvin Jasic .	-5.6386
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about her work .	-8.6742
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry , but now also taught guitar .	-5.0612
Stefan Schemmelmann , the sound technician , knew to report to Franke that the latest event in Ludwigshafen took place - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest .	-6.4124
And Alvin Jasic placed it on Youtube .	-2.7144
" It 's not about winning , " Franke said .	-3.1728
In fact , all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy .	-2.7584
However , there was something special for the jury 's favourites - so that others can also listen to their songs .	-5.1330
A whole CD can be Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann .	-2.6711
Other musicians can record a song : Ihmig with his help drummer , who impressed Franke especially with his musicality , and the " Lummerland-Rudel " : " a very nice performance " with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon , Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle .	-4.9925
Like everyone , the children entered the finals again - and even sounded good without electronic support , as Franke said .	-5.7688
The jury was guided by the aspects originality , reference to Hiltrup , meddling in the melody and recognition value .	-4.8904

The word game : " Decrypto " in the play .	-7.4830
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other .	-3.1375
For each page , there is a screen where four cards with keywords , which you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - only if you inserted them .	-6.8768
This ensures that the other side can 't read anything .	-4.7169
On the cards , for example , you can read from left to right : " 1st Renaissance .	-4.9387
2 . Window .	-3.5806
3 . Würfel .	-1.9215
4 . "	-6.4060
These are the terms that must be constantly encrypted .	-3.1374
Because it is not the terms that are to be guessed here , but codes .	-4.6190
Changing a player per team is the encryption .	-3.9389

His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms " cube " , " feast " and " window " - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as not as possible ; because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice .	-13.1714
The encoder notes and reads aloud : " Werfen " for the dice , " Lose " as a contrast to feast ; here , of course , something like " Party " would be possible and " Prague " because he has gone to school and knows the windows there .	-7.4423

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody : Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband .	-1.9556
On the " Traumschiff " Heide Keller became a star .	-2.4644
Now she openly talks that the series may have had a complicity in her marriage with Hans von Borsody .	-6.4869
Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the " Traumschiff " made Heide Keller ( 76 ) famous , but on January 1 , 2018 she went on board forever .	-4.0165
The series she made her star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody ( 1929 - 2013 ) , with whom she was married for ten years .	-4.0019
" That could also have been a reason .	-2.9626
For I was awakened with this work , traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of me admired colleagues took me on equal terms " , said Keller in conversation with the " picture on Sunday " .	-4.9343

She always felt " not good enough for him .	-2.7393
He saw in me an emancipated woman , whom I was never in truth , even if I was sometimes cheeky and courageous on stage .	-5.1435
I wanted our love for always is " .	-1.6653
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner , Keller once again said yes , " although I was afraid that it could even go wrong a second time " .	-4.7787
On the day before the official wedding I sat in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything .	-4.5758
The marriage to Borsody also failed .	-2.4376
Why it never worked with the men ?	-4.3105
Because I wanted too much .	-0.9049

" Then suddenly a ruck went through the team , " Bieletzki summarized the second quarter of an hour .	-4.2400
The delay was only two goals .	-4.7934

The preaching was performed during the Biker service of the parish of Dirk Grzegorek .	-6.0885
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical entertainment .	-8.5696

This , too , was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday .	-3.5658
Feast orfer home club celebrates great celebration : After the apple comes the milk milk .	-5.3797
Borisch was also active on the actual day of action .	-3.6220
They served their hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes .	-3.2746
Great interest also aroused Georg Hartmann-Niemerg .	-2.5607
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his astonishing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice .	-3.9840
Then and when left Hartmann-Niemerg the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big funnel .	-8.8088
With a little muscle force , a fine crushed mass was formed from the apples .	-4.6762
Many of the children could not imagine how to make a tasty drink .	-5.6939
However , these important steps were also taken at this late Friday afternoon .	-4.0971
In forms packed and wrapped by nets , Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the slice of apple pieces , which look good as a bit like a chicken .	-8.7691
Thanks to some technical support , the last step of the work was no longer so difficult .	-4.8232
The freshly pressed juice ran after and into a big vessel .	-4.0025
But the farmer , too , had already completed completed specialities .	-5.0692
Thus he opened his " treasure chest " and presented the older visitors the latest feather white .	-3.7970
The demand for the good drop " Made in Füchtorf " was correspondingly high .	-3.7474
In a cosy atmosphere , the parents came into the conversation , while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing , but also the built up refuge for themselves discovered .	-6.5213
Also active of the Füchtorfer comradeship former soldiers committed themselves within the framework of the festival and invited at some stations to temporary games .	-5.4868
In the coming year the association will also offer an action day .	-4.9087
Then , as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out , it will not be the home in the heart of the town ’ s savings bank .	-5.1203
Instead , a farm will be visited .	-2.1575
This is also obvious from the subject : after all , it will be about milk .	-5.4504
1 : 4 against Frankfurt : Hanover with four seasons default : " Beschissene Situation "	-8.3496
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat , coach André Breitenreiter met his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 to speak to them .	-5.7919
There were a lot of positive things before : 1 : 4 ( 0 : 2 ) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt but not to .	-4.5946
" It is an embarrassing situation , but you have to go out as a team , " said 96-footballer Pirmin Schwegler and shoved to : " This is obviously disappointing , because you always take a lot before " .	-7.0160
The more dispassionate Lower Saxony , for which only Florent Muslija ( 86 ) joined , has two counters at the bottom and is a candidate for departure in its current constitution .	-6.8603
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic , Frankfurt celebrated the first season home victory .	-3.7737
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute , Rebic ( 45. + 1 ) , Jonathan de Guzmán ( 59th ) and Luka Jovic ( 89th ) achieved before 46.300 spectators the goals for the DFB Cup winner who after the successful general test for the European League match against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table .	-5.1263
Croatia ’ s vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hessen in his race debut and never got to grips with Hanover ’ s defenses .	-6.6359
The storms long after the World Cup showed with its speed and perseverance why it is so valuable for harmony .	-5.2480
In addition to Rebic , the Brazilians from the FC Liverpool were also the first to start the initial formation of the Frankfurt , which started in vain .	-7.6642
A tornet of torn headball from Lucas Torró ( 17th ) was the first danger .	-7.6623
Six minutes later , Sébastien Haller was replaced by Brazil ’ s Felipe , who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer ( back ) , in a promising position at the last moment .	-5.8630
The leaders of the Hausherren almost inevitably and completely deserved .	-3.8917
Filip Kostic raised the ball to a fenced corner in the penalty room , Haller extended by head to the gate where Ndicka only needed to keep the foot .	-5.8820
It was the first Bundesliga meeting for the defender , who was bought by the French league AJ Auxerre in the summer .	-6.2342
And Frankfurt presented before the break .	-3.4064
This time , Haller adapted to his Sturmpartner Rebic , who snatched and left no chance for 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser .	-6.6007
During the half-time , Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak idea of his elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt .	-4.3778
The Lower Saxony played a little more courageous forward , but the ideas that arose remained short before the end , when the buffer was still in operation .	-10.0027
They were much more efficient .	-2.9217
After a short hour Rebic started a solo and then put right De Guzmán , who had to push the ball into the empty goal .	-5.8727
The rest was for the Frankfurter gegen überforderte Gäste nur noch Schaulaufen , auch Jovic met a minute before the end .	-4.1837
The Morlaixplatz becomes the party mile .	-2.3081
In spite of cool temperatures , good mood prevailed at the Oktoberfest in the city centre .	-5.3995

Geisingen : Geisinger Christen feiern Heilig-Kreuz-Fest est	-3.1344
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14 or Sunday afterwards .	-4.7099
The religious service takes place in the church of the town , then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final part .	-7.1436
The Holy Cross Church houses the Christ , who dates from the Thirty Years War and is said to have shot a Swedish soldier on the legend .	-5.7647
The blood flowed out of the firing .	-4.8944
This led to a large pilgrimage to Christ , which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church .	-4.4218
This is not finished to this day , only the Altarraum stands , the missing Langhaus is hinted by the trees .	-5.8252
In his preaching , Pfarrer reminds Adolf Buhl that the cross is a sign of hope , comfort and life .	-3.0738
The divine service was badly attended despite the importance for the violinist Pfarrei .	-4.6338
After the service of God , the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the Cross ended .	-5.6929
For many years , the Catholic Church choir has been inviting a Catholic pastor to the secular part of the festival .	-4.5402
The choir members sent the visitors with hearty dishes as well as a large selection of cakes and the weather adapted , farm ice .	-4.9044
In the afternoon the parish also offered guided tours around the city church , Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors about the damage to the façade , roof , sandstone work and windows as well as the upcoming construction work that will drag on until next year .	-6.5767
After the rumour has come to an end , the damage has been more accurately identified and specific tenders prepared .	-6.5329
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned , because the damage that was already present a few years ago has increased , but more has been found , which was only made possible by the use of scaffolding .	-8.0464
The socket plaster works have been completed , the natural stone works are still to be started before winter and the half of this work is still to be completed this year .	-12.5279
inauguration : New home in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße	-2.9963
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße .	-3.7046
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße a very special house is now handed over to its destiny - there was unanimous agreement on the inauguration date for all present .	-7.7362
After all , the 12 wheelchair users who have been living in the home of the life-aid Donau-Iller have been dependent on the particular architecture of the new building for some time .	-6.5263
Broader corridors , corridors and doors , larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas , architect Rudolf Bader took his concept into account .	-3.5713
The first plans began around eight years ago , when the former US Army officer building was put on the test bench for the inhabitants of Handycap : " The house had come into being for years and had ceased to function in time according to the equipment , " explained Bader retro.	-8.5978
In 2016 , the excavators crashed to tear the house down .	-4.3326
The new building should be designed as brightly as possible so that the inhabitants can feel at home in it , according to the architect .	-5.6543
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new home in Iller .	-3.4771
Approximately EUR 4.6 million was invested in the new building .	-4.3303
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million , the district of Swabia EUR 450000 .	-3.1823
According to the architect Bader , the works have remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms .	-5.0885
He also thanked the Managing Director of Lebenshilfe , Jürgen Heinz .	-2.9582
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy .	-5.4306
However , the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many presets that gave the inhabitants the freedom to move without foreign help .	-6.1700
Similarly , the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben , Gertrud Kreutmayer , said : " The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants who need tools to be mobile " .	-5.3786
In doing so , the housing and functionality was well combined , said Kreutmayer .	-4.7271
And further : " The plot in this situation is a real happiness because it is so in today 's situation no longer to acquire " .	-5.3073
Altogether , the new residential home in the Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities , divided into three residential groups , covering almost 1500 square meters .	-6.3051
We are proud to be Managing Director of Lebenshilfe Heinz at the eleven full-time employees , all of whom are employed by collective bargaining .	-6.8606
Germany : Sweden laments differences between East and West	-3.0807
Berlin - Prior to the day of unity , the deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to be deprived of East German . the of , , and .	-11.3999
There are differences that after almost 30 years of unity hurt .	-2.6252
With these differences , we must not be content , " said Prime Minister Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on Sunday . "	-7.6656
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country .	-3.0566
It is unacceptable that , on average , East Germany worked longer than the people of West Germany , but received 15 % less pay .	-4.6515
" I can explain this almost 30 years after German unity no one , " Schwesig said .	-3.9016
North Korea : Does this putty dog stop the Korean conflict ?	-2.6888
The one-year Pungsan Jagdhund is supposed to smooth the sway between the two Koreas .	-4.8737
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul , Pyongyang gave the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs .	-3.8071
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday , the two reached about a year old dogs already their recipienon Thursday .	-4.3486
They then crossed the border town of Panmunjom with three kilograms of dog food to facilitate the " reconciliation " of animals .	-9.0349
The dogs with the thick white coat , pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent .	-2.6787
They belong to the national cultural asset of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .	-6.3554
The friendship bid announced by North Korea at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korea ’ s leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September .	-11.8153
Both countries agreed to join together in the international sporting competitions , such as the 2020 Olympic Games , and jointly apply for the Olympic Games to be held in 2032 .	-4.9130
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile engines as a result of mutual rapprochement .	-5.1480
Austria ’ s Moved History in the Mirror of 99 Documents	-2.5489
What is Austria ?	-0.4566
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic , which has now been celebrated in this year of commemoration for almost ten months , numerous new books have appeared which answer this question mostly in retrospect to the last hundred years .	-6.3414
In a very different way , Wolfgang Maderthaner , historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive , puts it in the magnificent picture book " Austria " , which will be published on October 1 .	-6.0442
New Week , New Chance for Government	-1.4687
Back to factual work – that is the unofficial motto for today ’ s starting week of the Great Coalition .	-5.0987
Hardly any interview , hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her CDU , SPD and also CSU ministers last summoned the " return to factual work " in some ways .	-6.9269
This may be the case with some craftsmen , doctors , cashiers and other active citizens in that country , who are entitled to the question of what is actually the difference between work and material work , but it is ' s drum .	-8.3590
If the federal government is now ready to return to its mission of governing , it should not be discouraged from discussing concepts now .	-6.3305
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and whims of the last few weeks may already be shown on Monday .	-6.4419
In the evening , the top of the governing parties come together to form a coalition committee .	-4.3838
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early on ; a lesson from all the dispute .	-6.6685
First of all , however , the Diesel retrofitting and the Immigration Act are once again subject to conflict-prone issues .	-7.1722
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to be able to get away with exchanging premiums glimpsively , and SPD and CDU see manufacturers as being obliged to upgrade older diesel technology .	-7.8519
While a rapprochement took place in the diesel crisis over the weekend , the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned immigration law .	-5.6496
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training .	-4.0941
The Union is strongly opposed to the ' change of track ' from the asylum system to the labour market .	-3.0870
So there will be disputes again among coalition partners - and how should it be different ?	-4.2547
Not like and like GroKo has joined forces , but three partners with some very different social images and priorities .	-5.7488
Dispute is good .	-2.2774
Without dispute , a society so diverse , sometimes conflicting , does not advance .	-4.6062
However , in order to be constructive , dispute must not be allowed to be raised again for party tactical reasons on the question of being or not being .	-6.6991
We are still talking about politics , not about theatre .	-3.3325
The Union and the SPD should fight - but always have a real view of the reality of people 's lives .	-6.1745
What is feasible and useful to many ?	-2.3625
With this key question , both the diesel issue and the spure-change issue can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence .	-6.0808
Above all , the parties must now fight .	-4.0973
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger	-1.6964
Minister in Visier	-1.5503
Does the Minister of Labour , of all people , violate the law of service in force ?	-5.1277
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look .	-7.3647
" Really day and night , " their legalists had worked on the social security reform , reported a superficial social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago .	-5.9028
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger , the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein ( FPÖ ) , which refers to surprise , now brings the matter to Parliament via question .	-5.5638
They assume that the Minister would only express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and would not wish to declare any violation of the law of service in front of the cameras in progress ' .	-8.8871
Nevertheless , they now have questions to be able to speak of any suspicion .	-4.0532
Police are riding a street in search of women 's equality .	-5.2836
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to speak .	-3.4893
There is now confirmation .	-1.6941
Since early Saturday morning , the state road between Naila and Bad Steben will be dug .	-7.4753
The route is still closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday .	-2.9085
It was predicted that the investigators had previously used an archaeologist .	-4.5262
The dog , specially trained for the odor of old human bones , together with his guide , finally managed to limit the relevant position to a few metres in several cases .	-7.0995
In addition , a ground anomaly was discovered along with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bavarian Monument Protection Agency in the area of the said road site .	-5.4320
For more than a year now , prosecutors and criminals ' police have been handling the case of missing persons .	-6.0507
Time and again , a bicycle path was closed at Marxgrün and investigated with sonars , because the investigators suspect that in the course of the reconstruction of the state road 30 years ago Heike ’ s body could have been frozen .	-7.4285
Colour powder and eggs : Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary	-2.9387
On Monday , Catalonia ’ s disputed independence referendum will be the first time .	-4.8288
But there are already wallets .	-5.3229
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the autumn of 2017 .	-6.1543
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017 , the centre of Barcelona saw clashes between separatists and the police .	-4.0017
Catalan security forces were attacked by the pro-independence , among other things , by colour powder , as they sought to prevent this from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard .	-6.3701
Some 3000 police officers at Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honour with a rally their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year in the illegal referendum .	-5.3097
In trying to prevent citizens from voting , there was also violence at at the time . . , , , , , , , , , . , , ,	-8.9214
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep separate the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces , reported Spanish media .	-3.7335
Some of the 6000 separatists , however , would have tried with force to break the police chain and , among other things , used colour bags and eggs to police the officials .	-7.0494
Six people have been arrested , 24 others have been slightly injured and the authorities have been invoked .	-4.6008
On Monday , for the first time , the independence referendum will be .	-3.0468
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain , the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced rule in the autumn of 2017 .	-4.2137
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium .	-2.5190
Other politicians have also moved abroad .	-3.7703
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement , on the other hand , remain in U-custody .	-4.4858
In December , new elections were held in the region .	-1.8513
After the new Catalan government took office in May , the forced administration was ended .	-4.2575
But the new regional president , Quim Torra , also insists on the ' right to self-determination ' of Catalans .	-3.1951
Football : Oberliga Westfalen : Versammelte Ratlosigkeit : FC Gütersloh und RW Ahlen trennen sich torlos	-2.0221
Red and white ancestors continue to appear .	-4.0723
The FC Gütersloh also achieved only one 0 : 0 draw .	-4.6096
The closing light and the third last puppets them in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as gathered helplessness .	-5.8686
The first half was manageable by the entertainment factor .	-3.0992
If you would rather get a beer or a bratwurst , you could do so without worrying about it .	-5.8691
There was no danger of missing a chance because there was practically no one .	-4.0105
First shot after half an hour	-1.6923
For the first ( harmless ) shot of the whole lot , Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible in the 28th minute .	-3.8047
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility had the Ahlener , when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty margin to a parade .	-4.6672
Even more innocuous were the hosts .	-2.3793
Their most effective action was an early change .	-2.8629
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury , for him came Sinan Aygün .	-3.6321
After the change , both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom .	-3.6178
In the 48th minute , Sebastian Mützel was able to reveal for the first time , at 18 meters above the housing and after an hour , the goods sloh also appeared .	-10.5437
After a conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz , it went fix .	-2.5971
In the early days of the show , Konter played on Aygün " krönte " Nick Flock ( 62nd ) with a flashy shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann .	-9.9272
In addition , they laid the Ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein after a headball from Wieckowicz ( 66th ) .	-5.9408
RWA-Interimstrainer Angelo Daut reacted , first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy ( 60. ) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel ( 70. ) .	-4.4417
It did nothing .	-2.3955
More than an optical superiority thanks to his own initiative , the Ahlener did not bring about .	-4.3532
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance , but also did not bring anything .	-10.0466
Angelo Daut made an effort to remove the positive : " I like the fact that we played at zero " , but unfortunately the zero was also at the front .	-7.4188
" This time we were not as dangerous as we were against wood wrapping and although our opponent had no desire to play with us , " said RW Ahlens Interimstrainer .	-6.2902
Apparently " cheered everything so a bit " against a team , " which only wanted to defend .	-4.9100
In any case , I did not have the feeling that we could get a counterpart , ' Daut .	-5.6953
However , one did not feel as a spectator to his body as if his team could shoot a gate .	-6.8887
The idea was too meagre for that .	-3.7432
Recking fields Erntedankmarkt : Fortunately , there are enough chalmers .	-5.0384
Brigitte Ransmann , Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle are happy to welcome these donations .	-3.5363
The Honorary Officers assure : " These donations remain in Reckenfeld " .	-5.3233
At the opening , the sky was shining blue , but the space was still somewhat empty , but that should change during the day .	-7.2144
Because : " Here it is so nice sociable , so we are here today , " said a visitor .	-4.7581
The organiser of the Festes Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper pinch of humour .	-4.3976
For the couple Brockmann , which was supposed to be woven against food , Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer sprang in the short term .	-3.9357
The Verena ( daughter of Ferdi Kreimer ) has become ill .	-2.0301
But there is enough chalk .	-2.4032
And the " replacement " did not allow itself to be entertained by musically increasing visitors .	-4.7084
This was so good that at the late hour some folk songs were sung .	-4.9743
" Just great " , Marcel Kreimer was delighted .	-3.4789
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date of this time in his schedule .	-3.3309
He is pleased about the many assets with their booths , including mostly clubs .	-4.8681
" Actually , there should be something like a blackboard , " he thanked nevertheless for the action of the male choir .	-5.0233
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those who were at the booths and also joined the other festivities held in September and the " Clean up " action .	-5.8933
Our garden town is a colorful place to go .	-6.0396
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took over the Maikranz with the help of the fire brigade and moved to the Winterquartier .	-5.1422
Many booths have been used for the physical well-being .	-4.9512
From sweetness to heart , everything was to have .	-7.4575
Stefan Hagemeyer , who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year , was creative in his decorative coffin .	-4.8830
Furnierarbeiten , Bierdeckel mit Reckenfelder Motiven und einiges mehr hatte er im Angebot .	-2.3714
A speciality offered three recken fields : " Reckenfelder Honig " , brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka , Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter .	-3.0786
The latter still has a speciality in this .	-3.5190
Honey cake in the glass , of course with honey from my own production .	-7.2209
As the little Elsa had to access again and again , so well tasted the cake .	-5.0564
The conviviality is that the visitors stay until the evening hours , even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival .	-6.6107
Schmierereien mit lokalpolitischer Botschaft : Keine gelungene Werbung für Skateanlage anlage	-3.1018
In Lengerich , unknown people hardly promoted the construction of a skateboard .	-4.7721
Jürgen Kohne from the municipal administration will answer the question of the WN in several places .	-6.9307
In at least one case , criminal charges have been made against the police for damage to property .	-5.1552
The three words " Skatepark für Lengerich ! " were written in large letters on signs , among others at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Town Hall .	-6.2760
Michael Rottmann , Manager of the Hall , reports that a correspondence on the advertising shield had already been discovered on the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro after the trade fair on 19 September .	-6.9246
Since the short message was apparently ' only ' left with an edding , they could easily be removed .	-5.6792
" A few days later , however , it was again there , this time " , says Rottmann .	-6.5433
It assumes that the corresponding advertising badge must be replaced .	-4.5234
A special note is given precisely this case by the fact that several large companies are also called from Lengerich on the board .	-11.8972
If the skateboard is built , its realization is also to be made possible by sponsors .	-5.3061
Promises already exist , explained Jörg Hesselmann from the urban field school , sport and culture , without naming names .	-4.9257
However , it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the chosen board .	-9.5373
Local politics and administration have been dealing with skateboarding for years .	-4.4108
After the old one was dismantled at the LWL clinic , the search for an alternative location began after some time .	-4.6669
Finally , the Council voted by a majority in favour of the fire-fighting site .	-4.8825
However , this effort has not been made - too many factors seem to have opposed the construction of this site .	-6.3164
A U-turn followed in late June .	-2.6341
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously in favour of the Areal of the Gutenberg-Sch.	-3.9038

A Worse Airpass	-6.9276
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer , German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year .	-4.1184
" This year we had wind , 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm , " said the head of the trade union of air traffic control , Matthias Maas , the German press agency before the air summit on 5 October in Hamburg .	-4.1315
One important reason for the many delays and flight failures is the long-established personnel shortages in European air traffic control , for which there is no quick solution .	-5.9828
" The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year , but training new pilots takes four to five years , " said the trade unionist .	-3.5800
Europe-wide , the market for fully trained pilots is empty .	-4.5885
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone , some 100 people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace .	-3.8978
Maas again criticised the fact that various trade unions were not invited to the summit .	-3.1854
On Friday , representatives of the Federal Government , the Länder , air traffic control , airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city to address the causes of delays .	-3.9552
" If you want to talk about additional work condensation and overtime , this will not happen without us , " said the head of the GdF , who has many members in the German Air Safety Association .	-6.6742
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the Lotsen-Misere .	-3.0289
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low .	-2.6669
The resulting cost and personnel savings in the national air traffic control systems are now fully integrated into the operational business .	-5.5316
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer ( CSU ) to stand up for regulations in Brussels that do not further limit air safety .	-5.4683
At the moment , the EU ’ s targets would be aligned by 2024 , and further tightening would be feared .	-5.4863
The EU is under constant lobbying from airlines .	-2.3792
" Ryanair chief Michael O 'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years , " Maas said .	-7.3667
He hopes that the high costs of delay for airlines will lead to a rethink .	-5.1569
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if the German Air Traffic Safety Authority ( DFS ) offers a ' coherent training and future pact ' , Maas said .	-5.2768
The announcement of the inclusion of 120 pilotage annually over the next five years has just been enough to offset the age-related declines .	-6.1749
The necessary staff building is not yet connected .	-4.8471

The police wanted to pay tribute to their demonstration by colleagues who , almost exactly a year ago , took action against the independence referendum in Catalonia , banned by the Spanish central government .	-9.5170
At the same time , they demanded better salaries .	-1.9202
Members of the Spanish police and the Civil Guard find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers are earning far more than they deserve .	-5.1714
The demonstrators felt it provocative that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona , of all places .	-3.5691
" Why did they come here to protest ? " asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency .	-2.8242
Only to provoke and celebrate the fact that they have rushed us a year ago .	-3.4538
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearics , who only wanted to give his name to Daniel , rejected the charge .	-4.3202
" Of course we want to support our comrades who last year only have done their duty : to defend the law , " he said .	-3.1451
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a large European city and there is more echo here .	-3.9650
He and his colleagues have not come to provoke , " the policeman assured .	-4.1964

The Portuguese star crater played the best game together with the half hour of Valencia this evening , " commented Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3 : 1 ( 1 : 1 ) victory against the SSC Naples .	-4.9891
For the trainer , the expensive purchase of Star was also the decisive man in the important match against the persecutors without his own .	-7.1947
" Ronaldo had a lot of fun and makes it good , " said Allegri .	-2.3536
Even if we started with tactical errors , Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew .	-3.8716
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo , Juve shot the game after the early backlog by hitting Dries Mertens ( 10 minute ) and drove the hardest fighter .	-8.8227

Bester Juve-Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account .	-2.3046

On the wing saddled Ben Süverkrüp .	-4.0064
One is the male sparring partner , who sometimes comes to the conclusion of the sentence , and another is a true pianist : so congenial harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo .	-6.5039
That was also the case , with Beethoven and Chopin , but in a different way , like the Red Faden of the evening .	-6.0810
There , Teubner had brought a paradox into play : the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner , but he does not open the door .	-6.0706
A closed door without partner in contrast does not bring any benefit .	-4.3403
The piano soloist is now demonstrating the same thing : what would have happened to the composer of Mozart , would " the Nannerl " have opened the door unexpectedly ?	-5.4365
Thus , Süverkrüp slips into improvisations , from Bach 's " O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden " into the " song of death " , and from Mozart 's minor symphony into a playful dancing .	-4.5638
There were great applause and bravo from the full room .	-3.6872

Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the opportunity for a joint , conciliatory appearance .	-3.8264
" Rather than highlighting the affiliation of Muslims with German leaders to Germany , Erdogan used the date for his purposes , " complained Sofuoglu .	-4.8311

Trump admits to Kim : " And then we fell in love "	-3.2955
It is no secret that North Korea ’ s US president , despite the nuclear crisis , is well disposed towards Kim .	-4.6077
Now Trump has made his colleague a veritable declaration of love .	-3.4755
It also has to do with Kim 's " beautiful letters " .	-9.6536
At the tender age of 72 , the married US president has become a new flame .	-2.8392
The tragic thing is that it is a distant relationship .	-3.3765
In public , Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love on Saturday to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un .	-2.8560

No , really .	-1.1823
And not only did the talks with Kim have melted his heart .	-3.4724
He wrote beautiful letters to me , it was great letters .	-2.9327
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit : Trump referred to Kim ’ s announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests , though critics have so far paid little more than lip service .	-5.1169
The fact that the affection for the " Rocket Man " – so Trump ’ s nickname for Kim – that his martial threat might not be yours to everyone seemed to be well understood by the US president .	-8.4224
In any case , he took the expected criticism of his performance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling straight away : " Donald Trump says they have fallen in love " .	-5.7868
How terrible , how terrible is that ?	-2.8604
That is so unpretentious .	-2.7929
But take care of him , Trump declared , and then put his finger on the crowd : " I have always told you it 's so easy to be presidial . "	-5.8563
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crazy arena , but only 200 people out there .	-5.6450

Let the Rule of Law in Turkey Go	-3.2786
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet ( CDU ) , in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , has called for his own rule of law in Turkey .	-4.2378
The two countries ' relations are currently ' overshadowed ' , said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport .	-2.9376
This mainly concerns arrests , freedom of the press and freedom of religion .	-3.1768
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that , if relations are to normalise in the future , if economic relations are to be deepened , the rule of law is a very important precondition .	-4.2601
Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans in jail in Turkey , according to his own data .	-4.4529
He formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected .	-2.1473
Erdogan then re-emphasized the independence of Turkey ’ s judiciary .	-3.3836
Laschet and Erdogan discussed this at short notice in a building belonging to the Bundesverteidigungsministeriums at Cologne Airport .	-5.8912
Initially , it had to take place at Wahn Castle - the castle owners had rejected Erdogan out of political conviction .	-7.1881
Erdogan went on to talk about opening the Ditib-Mosque in Cologne .	-3.2304
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building .	-3.0748
But he said : ' Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country ' .	-3.1547
And we are also their points of contact - not the Turkish President .	-3.3923

While US President Trump will not tire of emphasizing the success of negotiations on denuclearization in North Korea , the East Asian regime is more sober .	-3.8263
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for the removal of Washington .	-3.2102
North Korea ’ s foreign minister , Ri Yong Ho , has accused the US government of obstructing negotiations on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula in the UN General Debate .	-3.8375
" The recent deadlock is therefore that the US is building on coercive measures that are lethal for confidence building , " said Ri in New York .	-9.5057
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances .	-2.5274
" Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and under such circumstances , there is no way that we can disarm ourselves as the first self-disarming , " the North Korean chief diplomat said .	-5.0966
The fact that punitive measures could force North Korea to its knees is a pipe dream for people who do not know us .	-8.1813
To build trust , however , his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests , destroying a nuclear test facility , Ri pointed out .	-4.0045
On the US side , however , there have been no ' appropriate reactions ' , the Minister criticised .	-4.6065
Because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile programs , last year alone , the UN Security Council decided three times to impose sanctions on the internationally isolated country .	-3.9078
US President Donald Trump and his foreign minister , Mike Pompeo , have been pushing for strict enforcement of criminal sanctions at the United Nations in recent days .	-4.4246

It was financed by donations from the community , for which the young people wanted to thank the food .	-5.1258
The launch with the new facility was not exactly simple , as Henriette Westbuer , the leader of the HoT , remembers .	-4.7768
We had prepared our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were well prepared for the great day .	-5.0113
But then came the bad surprise on the first day after the summer break : a blackout had set aside the huge two-part refrigerator , the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of .	-5.4500
" Now we had to start again from scratch : although we received a lot of support from friends and neighbours , the children and young people wanted to create it alone , " he says .	-5.4592

The result could be seen , the guests were enthusiastic .	-3.6457

On the seventh day of the previous season , Bavaria even had five meters behind Dortmund , which has now taken the lead again with one point .	-6.8011
And so , with a wink at least , Kimmich appreciated that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end .	-6.3397
" Yes , that 's good , " said the national player .	-3.8183
It is good for the league .	-2.9554

" If there is one thing that clearly affects society and football without an immigrant background and says : " The issue is important because we have to take care of ourselves " , that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work , " Grindel said .	-7.2732
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özi affair , he wants to run for office again next year as DFB president .	-5.5958
" I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes , " said Grindel .	-3.1483

Polar cold air brings snow on the mountains in the west of Neuschn. . . . . . . . . . . . .	-8.2121
Mrs. Holle is shooting her beds for the first time next week in the west : Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg , Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday .	-4.3415
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics ( ZAMG ) , the snowfall threshold drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys , it drops down to about 1,000 meters in intense intensity .	-6.8231
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern you can expect snow from 2,000 metres with 20 to 40 centimetres .	-4.5321
On higher pass roads ( Arlbergpass , Timmelsjoch , Bieler Höhe , Brennerpass , Gerlospass , Felbertauern , Großglockner Hochalpenstraße ) the road conditions are therefore wintry .	-3.7867
Farmers may begin on Monday with the annual Knickpflege	-4.5117

The unique " green forests " in Germany have characterised the landscape of the forest region of the Federal State for about 200 years .	-6.3500
The five metre wide tree and rock hedges are " forest treasure " and for many animals and plants the last retreats .	-6.7506
Knicks connect living spaces located as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function , as the Managing Director of the Nature Conservation Association Germany ( NABU ) said in Schleswig-Holstein , Ingo Ludwichowski .	-4.6834
Knicks are Living Fences	-1.8221
The Knicks were founded on the grounds of a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766 , who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein .	-4.8995
The " living fences " were not only field limbs and cattle fences , they also supplied firewood and beams to the farmers for their workshops .	-4.7504
From that time on , his name " Knick " also came : " By patching " the branches , the dense , interminable boundaries could develop .	-7.8588
Today , between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea , there are some 45 000 kilometres of hedges and give the picture a more elaborately structured landscape .	-7.0182
According to the NABU , it is now used as a replacement space by around 7000 species .	-5.4294
In one kilometer Knick could live up to 1800 different species and up to 30 bird pairs .	-3.3213
However , its ecologically important function can only be performed by the Knick if it is properly maintained in winter .	-4.9357
Apart from the variety of species , Sonst also shrinks into a light-coloured tree line , which also loses the wind protection effect , said Ludwichowski .	-8.9316
According to the Ministry of Agriculture , Knickpflege can only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March .	-3.9124
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian speaks about SItuation on site .	-2.9384
The locals Radia Pinto describes in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and the tsunami :	-3.6317
Have you been there during the tsunami ?	-3.9685
No , I was at the time just in Jakarta on the island of Java .	-2.1627
When the earthquakes were , my wife called me , she was in Palu .	-1.4400
When I learned of the tsunami , I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi .	-6.9676
As I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight , as the airport was closed at Palu at the time .	-4.2698
How is the situation on the island now ?	-1.9249
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be used .	-3.7370
When I arrived , I saw the houses on the coast , all of which are completely destroyed .	-6.2937
Also our office of " World Vision " is destroyed , but we have furnished provisionally something where we have also accommodated other people .	-4.2658
Where do the Sulawesi people now look ?	-3.0890
Many are on the surrounding hills , where they still endure fear of another tsunami and earthquakes , and where they have no access to water and food .	-5.0922
Some people are staying in their homes , there are still aftershocks .	-5.1034
Because many grocery stores and even the petrol stations are completely closed , people sometimes smuggle food and petrol .	-4.9853
The public service has been shut down completely , and the national government is helping .	-2.9798
A prison has also been destroyed , the prisoners are partially free and the search for them is difficult .	-4.4567
There are still many bodies around , many people have not yet been found and are missing .	-2.9020
How does communication and information on the island work ?	-2.8516
At the moment we have a hand vaccine , but it didn 't work before and we got information only on the radio .	-7.1748
Many people are still looking for their children , neighbours and other people they do not know whether they live and where they are staying , because people during the earthquakes were not at home , but for example on the way .	-7.4891
The Tsunami warning system has not worked properly .	-2.0987
Do you have any information ?	-2.1606
We do not know the reasons for this , but when the warning came , many people thought ' Okay , not a tsunami ' - and then he came .	-3.8257
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami , there was a misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they are banished to the surrounding mountains .	-4.6164
Is an island like Sulawesi , which lies on the Pacific Firering , not prepared for earthquakes ?	-2.9647
But there are earthquakes every day , but that was the worst .	-3.2255
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations .	-2.5061
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed , the earthquake has hit a great many people .	-2.9038

After tumultuous scenes , his party friends agreed .	-3.5391
President Trump , who called Thursday ’ s heavy lectures “ Beschiss , ” initially abstained from further attacks on women , and , on the contrary , spoke of “ happiness in disaster . ”	-6.9608

Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated against Mainz the first season victory .	-2.8065
The relief on bowl is great after the first season victory .	-3.8007
However , Mainz also played a role in the time factor .	-4.0985
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches .	-3.7584
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05 .	-2.5899
" I saw every ball inside .	-2.5038
And there were many corners and many balls in our penal area , " said the athlete of Schalke 04 - and breathe .	-4.1440
After all , the Kings blue still managed to bring the scarce 1 : 0 against the Rhine-Hesse over the time and thus the first season victory under the roof and specialist . .	-13.1638
In fact , things could have been different .	-3.4361
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of chief trainer Domenico Tedesco security had given Tedesco : " In sum was the first half time good , both playful and of Pressing " .	-5.1370
In fact , not a headball monster	-4.8593
" The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me , " Heidel said : " If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench , I can understand that " .	-4.5759
The boys were afraid to leave their hands and had therefore withdrawn .	-6.4501
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz .	-2.0021
To save the first three meters of the season .	-1.9168
" We all liked a huge stone from the heart , " said Schöpf , who had no minor part in it with his head-ballet : " I am actually the worst headballer player in the man 's team .	-14.7507
But in the end , only victory matters .	-2.2716
The relief was felt throughout the arena , of course also at Tedesco .	-4.5069

I am very , very happy for the team and the fans .	-1.6470
We played intelligently , quietly and bravely , so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes .	-4.1762
The biggest shortcoming of the afternoon : Royal blue missed to worry more for clearer conditions .	-6.1357
The possibilities were finally there , for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka , who twice met Latte 59. / 72 or Amine Harit 62.	-4.9717
" Then it would not have become a Zittersieg " , Tedesco said : " You have felt the fear a bit . "	-6.0393

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration : A discussion at eye level	-1.9805
Before them is the author , Professor Doktor Aladin El-Mafaalani .	-2.3219
He has repeatedly been invited by Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild .	-3.8964
" I have made it my task to get interesting people to Greven for many years , " explains the founder and chairman of the " Reckenfelder Treffs " - the association that cooperates in the orientation of the evening with the alliance " Cultural Policy " .	-6.6824
El-Mafaalani rises very loosely in the reading , describing the writing process of the book , talking about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way .	-4.3352
With a lot of gesture , hard figures and some joke , he brings the listeners one of the most conflict-rich themes closer : migration and integration .	-5.1040
Why are conflicts increasingly arising despite successful integration ?	-3.2681
The most syrical author uses a metaphor to answer the question .	-4.4931
At one table , German society sits at the cats ’ table , the first generation migrants .	-4.3421
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table .	-2.9025
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany , they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate .	-4.0407
This leads to conflict .	-1.8830
Therefore , it is not crucial whether one fits in politically to the right or to the left , but rather : ' Am I for or against an open society ? ' , he stresses .	-7.7287
Initially rather behaving , then he always runs the discussion round .	-4.9058
And there is a need for speech .	-3.1058
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective , two teachers tell us how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in pupils .	-3.7588
El-Mafaalani is not on stage , a symbol for the discussion : it is on eye level .	-4.4413
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion , emphasizing that he speaks of the average , not of individual fates .	-4.3863
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue , because ' only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions ' , says El-Mafaalani .	-3.3740
During the subsequent signing session , he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer , with prepared Kurdish specialities , discussed intensively .	-13.0883

The town of Pliening has sold the first plots in the Neubaugebiet Landsham-Süd on the free market .	-3.9321
The mayor Roland Frick shares this with .	-2.3811
In addition , the application phase for those 20 plots is completed , which offers the municipality more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the former home model .	-6.9134

According to the mayor of Plieninger , it is the aim to have drawn up rankings for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council .	-6.3934
Subsequently , the award could take place .	-3.5857
In total , 50 plots of land are being created in the area in the south of Landsham for single and double houses , as well as four plots for multi-family homes with presumably eight housing units .	-7.2367
The development is now almost complete , the roads and roads are to be asphalted soon .	-7.4297
A single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person , the rest of the municipality of Pliening .	-4.5914
It sells the majority on the free market , 20 plots of land in the socially acceptable model .	-4.3824

The opening is scheduled for September 2019 , at the start of the next year .	-3.9130
So Schalkes Naldo " big sport " also succeeds on the bank bank .	-4.8390
For the third time in succession not in the Startelf : Nevertheless , Naldo thanks to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco .	-4.9428
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had left for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf , but on the exchange-bank , the understanding of many people would have been great if the almost two meters big Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul .	-6.7700
But when the Schalker players gathered after the 1 : 0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle and coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals , the 36-year-old , who called all the simplest half Naldo , and said ; " We have to thank trainers ! "	-6.7491
" That was very emotional , that was great sport , " Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain who , despite his renewed reserve existence , had no resentment .	-5.1746
Naldo probably knows that he was hailed as the best Schalker in the last season , that he was not really on the sidelines with his coach - he was given a break for good reasons .	-8.8265
A reason called " load control " .	-2.7321
It was not easy to tell him that .	-1.9863
" It was not easy to tell him that I tell you quite honestly , " Tedesco reported from the moment he said Naldo that he was not in the start eleven .	-4.4209
He is an important player , he is an important person .	-1.6581
But it 's always about the thing , it 's about the club , " Tedesco founded the step .	-4.8096
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes .	-2.3895
He is 36 years old .	-0.9321
It is important that everyone is able to snap through at the moment .	-4.9324
And that we all keep in the boat , Tedesco explained the rotation that last also Naldo caught .	-3.5614
And the Brazilian , with the wisdom of his advanced age , reacted to the Bank as a model team player .	-5.1780
The mood in Austria ’ s industry accelerated its decline relative to the eurozone in August .	-2.8036
The shopping managerindex ( PMI ) was low at 37-month with 46.7 points .	-5.0078
However , across Europe , Austria has the best third mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands , according to the Markit Institute on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies .	-5.9608
Unlike in Austria , the PMI in the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points , but the index is still the 13th consecutive month under the brand of 50 meters , which indicates growth .	-5.3599
Only Ireland 's industry cracked this threshold with 50.9 points in August .	-3.4056
Finally , the Greeks ( 42.1 points ) .	-7.7270
In Germany , France , and Spain , the scoreboard fell , but more slowly than in the months before .	-3.9321
In Spain , the index reached the highest level since March with 44.0 points .	-3.4776
" The slightly weakened decline may mean that the worst is over , " said Markit-economist Rob Dobson .	-4.4035
But industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter .	-2.9302
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight : export orders in the eurozone have fallen as much as they have since November 2011 .	-4.3597
For this reason , the companies closed the seventh month in a row . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-9.0505
In China , too , industrial production fell more strongly than was initially expected in August .	-7.1731
The voting barometer sank from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points .	-1.9134
Experts initially expected 47.8 points .	-1.2714
