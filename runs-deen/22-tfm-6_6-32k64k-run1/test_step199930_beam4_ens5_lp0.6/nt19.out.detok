Grindel, the DFB ’ s CEO, sees no basis for Özil-comeback
Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for the return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on getting into a conversation with him, also talking to him about why he seemed to have felt one thing or another in the way that was laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäler" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite months of debate over Özil ’ s photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have liked Mesut Özil to continue playing for Germany.
I also assumed, to some extent, that this would be the case, "said Grindel.
De 29 jährige hatte im Juli seinen Rücktritt aus dem DFB Team veröffentlicht und ihn auch damit, dass Grindel ihn nicht gegen rassistische Ansfehlungen während der WM verstanden habe.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared to talk to national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up any pressure, but he knows from football that when 'you leave a team or change an association, you talk about it with your trainer and I think it is a pity that this conversation has not yet come about'.
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung brannte
At 2.13 p.m. the fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly across the Schregergartensiedlung, danger was in default.
The professional fire brigade retired and found the hut at the arrival in full fire.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and the fire debris had to be removed to an absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut he had put a battery for lunch to store.
This may be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be investigated, as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable because the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Wearing Mother: Lindsay Lohan attacks the refugee family in the open street
What driven Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to take the children out of an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live herself, as she seems to want to wrest the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial review of the stream.
Look here at Lindsay Lohan 'Happy Luck'.
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and moving to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of trafficking children.
It does not provide evidence of all this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now," Lohan says in the video of her continuing to pursue the family along the road.
Apparently she tries to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she is turning around and Lohan is getting a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress tells her how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheeks.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This Task has Mascot on the Asteroids
The probe "Hayabusa2" started in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The Lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign tickers: The death toll on Sulawesi rises to more than 400.
There is talk of at least 420 deaths following the devastating 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated and isolated areas.
Elon Musk Returns as Tesla Board Chairman
At the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla ’ s leader, Elon Musk, worried stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electricity autobuilder.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have reached agreement.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and Tesla ’ s CEO withdraws from the board, but he is allowed to remain CEO.
British Conservative Party Congress
The Tories' Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The Congress is supposed to address foreign policy, trade, and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the hardline Brexiteers, at the forefront of former foreign minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a New Name
Macedonia ’ s Foreign Ministers (right) and Greece have already agreed.
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these duplication of names for years.
Now they have reached agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in future, and the people will vote on this Sunday - whether things are going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil ’ s presidential election, the country ’ s mood is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate, leading the polls.
His fiercest rival is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Diesel gate" reprocessing takes longer than planned.
"The Diesel task force is still there," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer of the Automotive Week.
Rupert Stadler, who was arrested and put on trial, announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be disbanded.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations are likely to be tested," he said.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in tackling the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was founded in September 2015, following the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother, Volkswagen.
Merten stressed that the car manufacturer has made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal never happens again.
The Volkswagen Supervisory Board postponed a decision on the future of Stadler on Friday and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the cigarette dealers became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At the moment, Bram Schot is managing the company as Commissioner Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the changeover to the new exhaust and consumable test standard WLTP there were production failures at Audi, Schot said "Heilbronner Stimme".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the A6, A7 and A8 models produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already has 15,000 reservations.
Grindel aspires to re-election - Lahm is to be appointed to the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to stand as DFB president again in the coming year despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as possible," said Grindel as a guest at ZDF's "Aktuelle Sportstudio" on Sunday morning.
We must always strive for re-election, and I will do so.
And then you have to check if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "want to work on the project of the future" after the European Football Championship was won in 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the chief of the association as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown over the summer fairytale affair.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first full three-year term.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EC-chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to cooperate on the DFB praesidium.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he should continue to be involved in this role in the Bureau and, of course, should be warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He was not involved in any speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a non-immigrant national player should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this post is run by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says that 'the issue is important, we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Decreasing the Balance
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scales that not only measure my weight, but also the body fat part.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but that is more for the sausages.
He says nothing about whether I have replaced fat with muscles.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear kick-off successes for Berlin and Oldenburg.
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started the season of the basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion won without problems 112: 55 (52: 31) and offered a convincing match for more than 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 meters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an attractive performance in front of 9113 spectators during his mandatory play debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of Trainer Ainars Bagatski with 84: 80 (39: 37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was with 24 points the best ever.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 meters.
Last year's Playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83: 76 (41: 34).
Karim Jallov, the new national player, played 24 points in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Basketball Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100: 64 (48: 30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings surprised the Oldenburgers with 25 meters.
The NBA-star Dennis Schröder has been a majority shareholder since the start of the season in Braunschweig, but disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26: 1 run of the basketball quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan Opening the Mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to hand over to the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were on duty - including snipers.
The Islamic Association of Ditib is criticized for being an extension of the Turkish Government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Scarecrow Secondary
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have been campaigning for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in New York ’ s Central Park.
"Engaged wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival in the night to Sunday to around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I am nervous, I sweat, but it is okay, because I am here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid agencies, have also shown themselves in the multi-hour spectacle on stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a terrifying second, when many spectators thought the sound of a decaying metal barrier was for shots, were frightened and tried to flee.
In short, panic arose, people ran into disarray.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people off the stage.
"Nobody tries to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available as every year free of charge on the Internet.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the many musicians and actors there was jubilation and applause from the audience - boos for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
It is true that he, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, advocated on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, Flake called in the US Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge, thus antagonizing many women.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse, including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations, after two women who, according to their own data, have experienced even sexual assaults, presented him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.
"You can also meet me in a lift at any time," Flake said at the New York concert.
Freedom of the Press: The Federal Government defends the journalist ’ s outpouring
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended a journalist ’ s outburst from the press conference of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freiheit für Journalisten" and was in the front row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
The press conference was disrupted.
The action of the journalist has created a great deal of unrest, which is unacceptable.
It was for that reason that he had to get the man out of his hands.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or of supporting or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
Turkey ’ s leaders blame the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities either: it was only in early September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials are still under way in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz Down with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and good-natured: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that is Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by NDR is known for lively discussions at the counter of the Hamburg harbour buttons "Schellfischtposten".
Moderator Ina Müller joins up with her guests with a lot of beer, some wine, or even a drink with a higher percentage, to relax the mood and the tongue.
A large number of celebrities also have the courage to make singing compulsory.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Best Day".
Munich got the trip to the far north but not at all good.
On Saturday he placed a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of. His face is,,, and.
The bed legend shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful hangover.
In response to his fans, he put forward some - perhaps not very serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: Never goes to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And injection.
And the egg liquor round that Ina cuts about half three also leaves away.
Alcohol consumption is written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted some tips to fight the aftershocks.
They ranged from instant breaks, fish breaks, or perhaps the most targeted headache pills.
Others simply enjoyed watching the normally attractive movie star.
The way in which Ina Müller has managed to survive the night life is not yet known.
Since she has moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to contend with vandalism and betrayal.
The access to the 36 km long railway cycle path in the Red Käppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly apparent.
Scherben, Zigarettenkirppen, Müll und Unrat, demilzierte Mülleimer und mittlerweile hinweiser - so präsentiert sich seit längerem der Eingangssgruppe zum Radweg auf dem Haaße-Hütte in Treysa.
For the flagship project Railway Cycle Path in the Red Käppchenland a more than shameful sight.
Members of the German ADFC group Schwalmstadt have also been working on this topic for some time now, according to the City of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Council.
There is no solution.
The proposals ranged from the installation of the group of seats to the regular emptying of waste containers and the cleaning of areas at the point of entry.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day, regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reported that the topic was also included in the local advisory board.
It is not only the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrations at weekends.
Not only does it often happen loud, but the yellow areas are also destroyed: the posts are torn out of the ground, the trash bin is demolished, signs are moved around, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are just the proverbial drop in the ocean.
You are annoyed that the resting place on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for the rest.
"Along the entire cycle path, the emphasis is clearly placed here on the Haaße hill", confirms the cycling authority, who is now also concerned about the new Ziegenhain cycle site that is opening today.
"If they suffer the same fate, it will be really expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "This may set the threshold of attacking the common good much higher.
However, this would require a police strike to pass immediately.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants to develop the Haaße hill.
It must be made more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The marketing of tourism can still be developed.
Our cycling path is of very high quality compared to others in Germany ", says the ADFC members.
As a highly critical point of danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation at Ascherröder Strasse in Treysa.
There is no bending on the Haaße hill.
In the case of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of the traffic flow, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Cultural Centre: The "Hiltrup's Kö" and the Lake.
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family reunion with coffee and cake from the honorary officers of the cultural station.
Seven formations have appeared, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long alachner living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Sterns", three members and three generations of the families of Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwartis.
This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What were the writers associated with?
In the places the Hiltruper lake and the market avenue were mentioned especially frequently.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his striking song to the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also recognised.
Again and again, it was a matter of experiencing coexistence in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short rebuilding breaks with short interviews with the artists or references to their work.
Humberg was told that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
Franke told the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest.
Meanwhile, Alvin Jasic placed a lot of things on Youtube.
"It is not about profits," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was something special for the judges' favourites - so that others can also listen to their songs.
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "A very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers of guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children went to the final - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects originality, relation to Hiltrup, unity of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She regarded the event as a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full Kulturbahnhof.
The Game of the Word: Decrypto
The players form two teams that are opposite each other.
There is a screen for each page, including four cards with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil - only after.
This ensures that the other side can't read by mistake.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Dice.
4. Feast '.............
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
It is not the concepts that should be guessed here, but codes.
One player per team is the key player.
He gets a code card which might contain "3.4.2".
"Decrypto" should not guess the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "feast" and "window", in such a way that his own team can see the correct order and the opposing team can't, if possible, win the game if he can break the code twice.
The keyer then notes and reads aloud: "Werfen" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he has paid attention in school and knows the window collapse there.
So it goes on lap by lap, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the opposite side - but you can more easily merge them with every hint the encryption user gives.
If you don't know what to do, you'll be able to find out what to do.
The most cryptic piece of "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time before they can finally play.
The explanation video on decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you've got started, you'll be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
But overall "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessor and genre Primus "Codenames", which also puts an agency issue on a game of few words but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it ’ s just a matter of installments and not winning points, it ’ s easy to invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man zeigt Polizei Hitlergruß und harharrasiert Gäste in der Kneipe.
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hitler salute in the Upper City of a passing police strike, then later he also fell in the Upper City in a pub as he harassed other guests.
After being clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night in prison at the police inspection in Kulmbach.
In a sober state, he must also be held criminally responsible for using the registration plates of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was Home to Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub of the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers burst in buffers, it was heard in a very pressing manner," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the railway station.
That did not inspire anyone.
The brakes also squeaked and the wagons crumbled.
That was pure railways.
Statements that are emblematic of Dinkel's homeland, Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald has such a place been shaped by the railways.
Here was the starting point for the Steilrampen mountain stretch to the north, which has its peak in Steinbach am Wald after an increase of about 220 m.
In order to cope with this, trains and schoolblocks that had their home in Pressig were used.
In 1901, the Bavarian State Parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 train shed, apprenticeship workshop, and a train station.
"The heart was the hub, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway runner for 47 years.
From the railway operations plant (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach were also operated in the north half.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported on a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for train and train blocks.
From 1977 they were only needed for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weighing was still ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were abandoned, and in 1991 the rest were abandoned.
Heidrich: 'It is regrettable that we have not envisaged better use of the site, including in the area of freight transport'.
At Pentecost in 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous festival in Pressegg for the anniversary of "50 years of electrification of Nürnberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," Georg Dinkel remembers.
Not long after the event.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were taken away, while the headquarters of the station in Pressig was a story.
"The Rangers and Hemminglers completed the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any failure would have had fatal consequences.
Why the railway station Presswig-Rothenkirchen led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
The China Open Candle
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund won the second round of the Beijing Tennis Tournament as Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won the China Open 6: 2, 6: 2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the World Ranking Third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazahnext or Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6: 3, 4: 2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian placed at number 13 gave up.
The Schwäbin is now dealing with Anett Konveit from Estonia.
In the context of the series "Kunst und Genuss" a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mitteleh.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors were looking at the ideal weather when the special opening ceremony "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open area of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelvornbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Rund um Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now available in Mittelernbach.
Mr. Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of the exhibition.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A few days ago, however, Hahn announced his resignation.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in tried and tested young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already played an active part in the selection of artists in the past and have helped shape flyers.
This year, on the occasion of art and enjoyment, there is again a 70-cent special belt brand designed by them, available at every art station.
There you can also buy this year's poster "Betzna", designed by Volker Hahn, for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased about the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler was able to be won for the musical frame from Nuremberg.
As the visitor walks through the spacious garden, it is quickly clear that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and in a playful way expresses it.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with coloured accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor on the right side of the "Lucky Tree" awaits the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, colour brightened, playful with 20 awnings, 24 horseshoes and 24 Alu-tubes.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object looks like a fairy tale and invites you to linger.
Barbara Launchneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to devote himself to the 15th year K & G in three dimensional letters.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
On half way, Siegid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "Der Wind das HimmelsKind".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy composition of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50 birthday party.
1968 - that was the time of protest and of the student movement....,,,,,,,,,
And the Albachters also gave way to their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Caesilia" there should be no more sangha in the district.
It has become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they launched the 68 Albatros MGV.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It will be full today," Chairman Jürgen Holstiege suspected, and he should be proved right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
For the anniversary of the foundation, they had had the festival revived.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
The traditional festival was back in time for the 50th anniversary.
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothes before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats, as usual, but rather comfortably at tables.
In the meantime movement was required: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln drew the sliders and asked for the dance floor.
A point of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachs themselves let the voice beat.
For the occasion happy songs were planned.
Almost already set: "such a day, as beautiful as today".
The "Rüdesheimer Wein" was suitable for the exquisite wine that many had before them.
In reference to another cool drink, "humulus lupulus", which is the Latin word for "hop".
Again sovereign was the chorus of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "He has such a light way, it's a master's achievement," and by the way, this time not only men were singing.
The female choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly covers Evergreen from the 1920s to the 1960s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.
Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine sounding poetry.

Volleyball: Third Women League: USC II wins high class Derby against BW Aasee.
The ascendant marches.
Three games, three victories - the Reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring finds itself in league three.
No trace of Scheu or Frackshausen, the independents do their thing.
And that's really good at 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city rival BW Aasee.
"This was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied '; on the contrary.
In the evening, at Ronja de Boer ’ s birthday party, the mood was good, the game was choppy.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set the guests had a satzball.
"When they reach the goal, a game like this can kick the ball," says Büring from many years of experience.
After all, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and achieved its full yield.
"We all know who is on the other side of a Derby.
That does not break us.
I saw good volleyball in phases ", didn't bother Annacker with the 0: 3 - and went to the agenda immediately.
It seems impossible to see where the Independent will go after just three days.
"It is simply too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball, "they don't want to look down to the fourth league anyway.
If the waistcoat is not smeared in the next few weeks, it must look up.
However, the first results can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take place on 14 October in Essen.

Her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband.
On the dream ship Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly that the series may have been complicit in her divorce with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the dream ship made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left the ship forever.
The series that made her star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"This could also have been a reason.
For I grew up with this work, travelled around the world with a suitcase alone, and many colleagues whom I admired saw me on equal terms, "says Keller in conversation with the" Bild am Sonntag ".
At first she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
For now, the journalists were only calling at Heide Keller.
'I do not know whether he liked it so much '.
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been envious, but "like many men Hans was afraid to talk about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only right one and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
In plain German, that means that I have lost my bearings', as she explains.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which I never really was, even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever ".
After an already failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
On the day before the civil ceremony I was sitting hypocritically in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
In the same year, Borsody's marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively ".
The night hawk, who regularly explores the city ’ s nightlife at the NZZ resort of Zurich, dared to attend the opening party of the ZFF.
Our Falter is not a moth, but a little faint-hearted.
And the brightness of a green carpet on Sechseläutenplatz is dazzling.
But it is just a film festival, more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening he torched over the square to ease himself in the "Aqualean WC Oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet facility, sponsored by a large sanitation company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the needlebuilding on the ground of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to create a luxurious ambience.
But this evening it stinks to the sky for some reason.
So get out here, over the other side of the street: Happy guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the cinema next door at the best level, celebrate the start of the festival like every year with a party in the three-story department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as you know, the works shown come from all over the world.
What do you need to think about an article about this festival in order not to become a cover advertisement for its 190 partner companies?
The Falter binds himself a small band around the feelers, which has put a good fairy into him, and two bullish turrets are really inviting him generously.
Inside, the geladens dance to live music well after midnight, or let DJ play the rhythms they catch each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite appetizers.
At the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters wait for sipping mouths, next door the incomparable Culatello di Zibello ham is freshly sliced and a chocolate fountain is bubbling.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without much loss.
We must love this country for that.
The Falter studies the shield at the escalator: "wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has lost himself in dresscode.
But it is more a condition construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the housewares department on the upper floor, the chicken turns a cocktail, prepared with espresso, called "Golden Eye", in accordance with the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not compulsory in this mix that a capsule manufacturer presents itself with.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting that brand for years, is not here in the evening either.
However, between local celebrities, cash desks and kitchen articles, a face is passing, which is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main characters will not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen is walking through the crowd, with almost sixty of them working as a choir boy.
It is not squashed, it is not made, it is at most concealed.
International stars of this film festival love this restraint, which is often misunderstood as a verbosity.
Maradona celebrates Mexico ’ s Mexico Victory with Cumbia-Dances
Diego Maradona, former football star, is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2: 0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57 year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as shown in a video already published on Saturday.

After the game Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my guys, always".

Handball: first-aid league 1: ASV sending after last minute bankruptcy 'destroyed on the ground'
His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, and as against Hullhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we totally wasted", annoyed the ASV trainer.
The owners quickly ran at 8: 1, even the early period of time taken by Biedermeier did not bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a pull through the team", Biedermeier summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the lag was only two goals.
Above all, Sendens Bester, Marius Hintze, met at the stage time.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor ’ s point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst left for 15: 15, followed by the relay changer.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Bring the parties into the action.
Biedermeier is usually wary of trying to blame others.
But: The 120 seconds penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received was "a joke".
LIT had laughing and met four times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys fought great, stood against seven men in the back and threw them into the empty gate again and again.
But they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to be here," says the completely used Biedermeier.
ASV-Gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Women have been missing for 30 years - Police dig after bodies.
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (County Court), the police are looking for the mortal remains of the woman.
On Saturday, workers dug up a road at Marxgreen.
To this end, the road surface and several layers of it were removed from it, as the police and public prosecutors jointly informed.
According to new evidence, the missing may not have been buried far from their place of residence.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
At that time, the investigators did not rule out a crime.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working intensively with the Public Prosecutor, according to the data, on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Heritage Authority, the investigators encountered a sensation under the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the position to a few metres.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users reveals the dangers that lurk in the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should use passwords to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, and there is no harm in equipping computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threat of dismissal as head of the billionaire company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an extrajudicial lawsuit against misleading Twitter messages, in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each as part of the comparison, and Musk holds the office of chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German board chairman.
He is entitled to remain opposed to this.
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing in the comparison, which must be confirmed by a court.
The SEC had sued the world ’ s famous manager in the US federal court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, also head of SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, who is now valued on the stock exchange at more than $50 billion.
Musk Know No Debt
Musk had him say that he had done nothing wrong and that he was sad and disappointed with the.............
He has always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, and funding was secured.
Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion in total.
Musk later turned back: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, Tesla must now find an outward-looking chairman, appoint two independent board members, and also establish a committee that monitors Musk ’ s communications.

Surveys: 46% do not want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021.
After the battles of the past few weeks, the GroKo collects several surveys.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey – Angela Merkel is being critically viewed.
Berlin - The AfD has surpassed the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid-Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey conducted by the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one meter to 17 percent, the SPD scores one point against the previous week, and scores 16 percent.
The CDU and the CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27%.
That is the lowest value to date for the Union on Sunday.
The Greens reach 15%, the left 11%, and the FDP 10%.
According to Emnid, if federal elections were held on Sunday, the governing parties, the SPD, the CDU, and the CSU, would all receive only 43% of the vote.
This means that the grand coalition has now lost the majority on Sunday issues in all the major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently reach 43 to 45% of the vote (Allensbach: 51%).
In the 2017 federal election, they received a combined 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the range is also large: the AfD, the second largest party in several polls, is 15-18%.
The Greens receive 12.5% to 17% of the votes.
The left is 10% on average, and the FDP is 9%.
For statistical reasons, depending on the share of votes, such surveys have a 2 to 3% increase and decrease uncertainty.
But popular support for German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen sharply since the 2017 federal election.
At the moment, only 48% of citizens find Merkel the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid poll commissioned by the BamS found.
According to the poll, only one in two (50%) wants the grand coalition to hold in three years by the next regular federal election; 41% want a new election.
A further poll published on Saturday also revealed a marked drop in Merkel ’ s popularity.
Germans are also divided about whether Merkel should run for the CDU ’ s presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, and 44 percent against.
As a result, 64% of the Union's supporters want to stand, while 35% do not.
Aldi ’ s Price Reduction for Love
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Those who say that there are no more romantic stories of acquaintance in times of Tinder should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fastfood dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place of acquaintance almost radiates an anachronistic romanticism for great love.
Yes, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts at the table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swing to the right.
The app Tinder has a reputation for being not a contact exchange, but rather a slippery exchange.
We took the test: how do women react, not to talk about the bush in the first message for long?
Here is the amazing result.
Usually Hollywood Lovestory has a lot of potential when the love happiness is preceded by an eye loss and re-launched plot.
If the guy is also reporting to his beloved at the e-mail address bio-putenflesh @ gmx.de, that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and his friends - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, the author of this advertisement in a branch that is unknown to us, is very much to wish that she will find her dreamman with whom she briefly talked about the "30% reduced bio turkey meat".
For her belief in the magic of analogue acquaintance, she deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood.

Football: District League: Researcher Performance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrhein
There were moments during this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
At the end of the season, he was the only player to win the World Cup.
All history.
In the meantime it runs again around Brandhoveweg.
Baptismal proof is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrhein, which in the past time only narrowly missed the ascent.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
"We have made the spaces narrow and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen ", Fesch praised his boys and went to each and every one of them for the match, simply to say" thank you "for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his departure (17.), who changed in Luca Rehberg (26.) and Jan Schroeder (38.) missed the lead.
This would almost have come to the point when, in a minute, the SCA took 41 places at the same time in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer jumping off dangerously in front of the Wolbeck Kasten - Tormann Damian Hallas proved himself to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed narrowly.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entry.
With the intervention of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left missed another fresh cell cure.
When Altenrhein Chris Naberbäumer noticed Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the placeholders 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The person who felt felt felt felt himself and demonstrated his danger in standards.
Westhues "Ding mit dem rechten Schlappen schlossen unterwegs aus Sicht des Schützen ein - 1: 0 (71.).
20 minutes still, which should become damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unfortunately flew the leather in the penalty room in the 80th minute.
referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the present (79.).
Shortly after, he had to survive in the final phase, before Geske had the final victory on the Puschen in the 87th minute.
Would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel) () (26.
Key words of the article: 'Explorers the VfL Wolbeck's appearance against SC Altenrhein is encouraging'.
Eintracht Frankfurt gewinnt 4: 1 gegen Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days - this was not enough for Trainer Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt wanted to secure the first home victory.
Stéphane Ante Rebic, who was first in the start after a injury, should help.
He was also a midfielder, Luca Torró, who was back after a injury to the club and was supposed to use his headball strength to prevent SGE from scoring more goals by standards.

Helicopter crash in Kottingbrunn
When landing, the accident occurred at the flight field.
The four occupants were slightly injured.
At around 2 p.m. a drama took place on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
When a helicopter landed, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was captured by a gust of wind, craved on the ground and stopped laterally.
The police, the rescue and the fire brigade were immediately agreed.
A large number of troops arrived at the accident site.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Passengers only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one material damage.

The exact circumstances surrounding the accident have not yet been clarified and are subject to investigation.
According to fire fighter Franz Respect, a small fire was born, but it could be quickly extinguished.
Report by the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity on corporate boards
As a result, only 8% of the board members were women as of 1 September, according to the report "Die Macht der Monokultur", which is officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"Companies will have to set up differently, otherwise international competitors will pass by them," said Stiftungs-Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom, or Sweden, purely male management teams, with few exceptions, are far from conceivable.
In comparison, the backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the number of women on the German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses among the companies in the medium-sized index (MDax).
According to Allbright figures, only 6.8% of boards are women.
In the previous year, however, the figure was 3.8%.
The proportion of women in the 30 DAX companies, which have led the way in recent years, has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not continue to undertake to increase the proportion of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If we were to recruit as many women per year to the boards of directors, we would have reached 40% by 2023," the report says.
Some even make poses: luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
With every Ferrari sold, the Italians earn 280,000 Euros and make 69,000 Euros of profit.
Large cars, big profits: this slogan is still valid today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the leading providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers charge per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer have dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made 69,000 euros of operational profit with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, while Tesla and Bentley add a lot to every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

A emergency car is seriously damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passerin was fatally injured when the emergency vehicle collided with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - preferably save lives.
Such a bailout ended a deadly 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - On the collision of a emergency car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were seriously injured, as the police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency doctor had crossed a red light on Saturday afternoon with Martinshorn.
He then collided on a crossing with the taxi that drove in the green.
After the collision, the doctor ’ s car hurled against a traffic light mast and a tree.
He wrote the Passions, who died at the scene of the accident.
The driver of the emergency car and the taxi driver was seriously injured.
The 62 year old taxi driver and the emergency car driver were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency forces.
The 29-year-old solicitor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another solicitor called him to do so - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn Public Prosecutor, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United is Losing Again, Mourinho We Untired
After the humiliating defeat in the league cup, Manchester United now also loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
West Ham United is subject to ManU 1: 3. The way of defeat is.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, when the reclassified Marko Arnautovic shot the 3: 1 for West Ham, only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly brought the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel ’ s pass, all Manchester ’ s defense players remained standing, and Arnautovic left all over the world to pass the ball on the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of an already largely inadequate performance.
The mood at Uniteds Manchester City is very different.
Citizens, trained by Mourinhos ’ great rival, Pep Guardiola, won a 2: 0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour Raheem Sterling broke the outer shield for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero secured the sixth victory in the seventh round, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool No More Table Leader
Three days after the league lost 1: 2, Xherdan Shaqiri won 1: 1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Like the Cup-Out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The match of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only match until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the match after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge was better off with his Silesian in the 89th minute.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless balance sheet, Chelsea was not beaten for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the Jürgen Klopp team in the Cup, with the draw in the league bringing the blues Liverpool to the top of the table..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like City, the London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2: 0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, who were going through Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute for the surprise team from Hertfordshire to report their.
Nine minutes before the end of the season, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unfortunately knocked down Alex Iwobi's entry into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season match.
Arsenal passed Watford for the fifth consecutive victory and is now in fifth place behind Tottenham, the big rival.
At 2: 0 the Wolves were defeated against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and finished 8th.
The Nuclear Car Show in Paris: Diesel
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not a subject, but still omnipresent: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let the German car companies loose at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will show their new products from next week in the French capital, together with competitors from all over the world.
Diesel does not really play a major role in this. oil. oil oil oil oil oil oil oil
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the brilliant scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have among other things their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstadt is to come onto the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
But both were officially presented.
BMW iNext is scheduled to start in 2021.
The new 3 Series is at the heart of Paris.
This year, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The exhibition, which is celebrating its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than a million visitors came.
At least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi during the severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
On Friday, two earthquakes struck the island.
The first earthquake had a strength of 5.9, and the second was 7.4.
Communication and transport links have been damaged and enormous material damage has been caused.
After the earthquake, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered on the beach for a celebration.
It is feared that the number of victims will continue to rise significantly.
The figures so far have only come from Palu.
But many other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
On Sunday, motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated with a help team the final divine service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged on Sunday to the motorcyclists.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the Engine Pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and therefore responsible for the pastoral needs of the PS strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle divine service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at the house Nordlight.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season at the Peace Church in Eveking.
About 150 bikers had met there on Sunday to celebrate a service that was anything but normal.
From 10 o ’ clock onwards, the Boliden had woken up in front of the church entrance.
At first, the biker's early gear was on the agenda and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty currywurst.
Besides the MoGo team there were also the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was held during the Biker worship service priest Dirk Grzegorek.
Singer Songwriter Valerie Lill provided musical support.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic-quiet," says pastor Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle divine service yesterday.
Tucked after the apple comes milk
Borisch was also active during the actual day of action.
She served her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and gradually demonstrated to his astonished audience the process from the ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when, Hartmann Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnels.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how they would become a tasty drink.
But you could also look at this important step on Friday afternoon.
Wrapped in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann ’ s Niemerg piled a layer on top of each other ’ s apple pieces, which look a little like a piece of chicken..
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the farmer, who is still alive, had already filled up specialties.
He opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good wine "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
The parents met in a cosy atmosphere, while the children were able to follow not only the process of pressing the apple, but also discovered the fortified castle.
Activists of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers also took part in the festival and invited them to play for short.
The Heimatverein will also offer an action day in the coming year.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out, the home house in the heart of the asparagus department will not be the place of events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the subject: after all, it will be about milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover, with its fourth seasonal default: 'Lost situation'
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter met his disappointed pros from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
There were many positive things to see before at 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It is a tricky situation, but you have to get out as a team," said 96 football professional Pirmin Schwegler, who said: "This is disappointing, of course, because you always take a great deal of care".
The more victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslima (86.) joined, are at the bottom with two meters and are a relegation candidate in their current constitution.
On the other hand, Frankfurt celebrated its first season home victory, led by the outstanding Ante Revic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored seven points in the middle of the table in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFCup.
Croatia ’ s vice-world champion, Rebic, was involved in almost every dangerous offensive by the Hessen in his debut post and never got under control by Hannover- ’ s defence forces.
The striker, long hit after the World Cup, demonstrated with his speed and perseverance why he is so valuable to harmony.
In addition to Rebolic, the Brazilian Allan, who was hired by Liverpool FC, was the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurter, which started to be lively.
Lucas Torró (17.) was the first to put in danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence against the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-lived Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the owners was almost inevitable and entirely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defensive corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to keep his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga left-winger for the French midfielder AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt shone before the break.
This time, Haller adapted to his storm partner, Revic, who was skilled in kneeling and allowed 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the middle of the year, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak idea of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Niedersachsen played a little more courageous forward, inspiring ideas remained until the end when the meeting point was still successful.
The bosses were much more efficient.
After less than an hour, Rebolic started a solo and then put the ball right across De Guzmán, who had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a show run for the Frankfurt people against overextended guests, Jovic also met one minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz Goes Party
Würselen Despite cool temperatures there was good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich Lord Mayor Dieter Reiter made it to millions of visitors at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two shots.
Geisting: Geisting Christians Celebrating
The Catholic vultures celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the closing blessing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ from the Thirty Years War, on which a Swedish soldier is said to have shot.
Blood then flowed out of the wound of fire.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the gunned Christ, which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the altar room stands, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort, and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geissinger parish.
After the divine service the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the Kreuzfest ended.
For many years the Catholic church choir has also invited the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish home.
The members of the choir provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish church offered guided tours around the city church, while Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the construction work that will continue until next year.
Since the framework has been in place for some time, the damage has been more accurately identified and the various calls for proposals have been prepared more specifically.
What is certain is that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage that was already there a few years ago has increased, but more has been found, which was only possible by means of scaffolding.
The plaster work on the base has been completed, the work on the natural stone is to be started before the winter and it is hoped that half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblichstraße.
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblichstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" is now being handed over to the Münsterblichstraße - everyone present agreed at the opening date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have already been living in the life aid home of Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Broader corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas has been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former officers' building of the US Army was put on the test bench for the residents with a handcap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in its equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators mounted to tear down the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel at home, according to the architect.
Danube Iller Lives New Home
About 4.6 million euros were invested in life support in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to the architect Bader, the construction work remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
The Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, thanked him for this.
The gap between a barrier free and fire safe design was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help.
Likewise, Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the Social Administration of the district of Swabia, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile".
Kreutmayer said that living space and functionality were well combined.
And again: "The plot in this situation is a real stroke of luck because it is no longer available in today's situation".
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblichstraße offers space for 30 disabled people on nearly 1500 square metres, divided into three residential groups.
Heinz, the Managing Director of Life Aid, is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by rate.
Germany: Sweeping bemoans the differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the Day of Unity, the Deputy SPD Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germany.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences, "said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern," Day mirrors on Sunday ".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germany, on average, worked longer than the people of West Germany, but would receive 15% less.
"I cannot explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one year old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang gave South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday, the two dogs about a year old reached their destination on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food in order to "make it easier for animals to get accustomed".
Dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the pledge at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join forces in international sporting competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and jointly apply for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the process of rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri missile test facility.
Austria ’ s Moved History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
Many new books have been published to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months now, most of which answer this question in a review of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" (picture book) of Austria, which will be published on October 1, 2010,.
New Week ’ s Government Opportunity
Back to the substantive work - that is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Grand Coalition starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, the SPD and also from the CSU did not last in a mantra-like way call for a 'return to the Sakharov work'.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in that country to ask the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but so be it.
When the federal government is ready to return to its mission - governance - it should not be prevented from doing so now by debating terms.
Monday may already show whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and lamentations of recent weeks.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the Coalition Committee.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflict early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, there are conflicting issues again on the agenda with regard to diesel upgrading and the law on skilled labour migration.
The CSU Transport Minister, Mr Scheuer, wants to allow the car companies to get off scot-free with exchange premiums, while the SPD and the CDU view manufacturers as being obliged to retrofit older diesel technology.
While the diesel crisis over the weekend has shown an approximation, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the proposed law on skilled immigration.
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do an education.
The Union is strongly opposed to the 'change of track' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be arguments again among coalition partners - and how else?
It is not equal to the GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without a dispute, a society characterised by such diverse and sometimes contradictory interests does not move forward.
However, in order to be constructive, disputes must not be allowed to be blown up again for party-political reasons on the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not about theatre.
The Union and the SPD should argue, but always have a view on the reality of people's lives...,,,,,,,,,,,
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this guiding question, both diesel and track change issues can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
That, above all, is what the parties must fight for now.
Pilz checks Working Time at Hartinger
Minister in Target
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, violate current law of employment?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" had their legislatures worked on the social security reform, reported an effusive Social Minister during the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandarin Daniela Holzinger the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) comes up with surprise - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question.
She assumes that 'the Minister only expressed her enthusiasm for the work of her team and never announced any violations of the law in force in front of current cameras'.
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to "be able to absolve drug dealers from any suspicion".
The Police Shoot a Street in Search of Women
Marxgrün - The police did not want to comment on this for a long time.
Now we have confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been digging.
The route is closed until Monday in the Marxgrün area.
The investigators had previously used an archaeologist dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was able, together with his guide, to limit the relevant area to a few metres in several cases.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the supreme Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year already the public prosecutor and criminal police court have been working on the case of missing persons.
Time and again, a cycle path has been blocked by Marxgrün and investigated with sonars, because the investigators suspect that, as the state road was rebuilt, hot bodies may have been buried here 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Barcelona riots before Catalonia ’ s anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But riots are already occurring.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police occurred in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked, among other things, by the pro-independence activists, who wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the civil guard.
Some 3000 officials from the National Police and Civil Guard wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who were deployed in last year's illegal referendum in the polling stations.
There was also violence at that time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6000 or so separatists would then have violently tried to break the police chain and, among other things, used paint bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, they said, citing the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under enforced administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also turned abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers from the then regional government and other activists from the separatist movement remain in underground detention.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was brought to an end.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the Catalans' right to self-determination.
Football: Oberliga Westfalia: Stunned perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split torlessly.
Rot-Weiß Ahlen continues on the spot.
Even the FC Gütersloh won only a 0: 0 draw.
They turned the rear light and the third last into a gathering of perplexity in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadium.
The room was very small and the bed was very uncomfortable.
If you would rather get a beer or a sausage, you could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a chance because there were virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot of the entire game.
The best - and, in principle, the only real - opportunity was the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westerterling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the prison border.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was early change.
It was necessary to replace striker Lars Schröder for reasons of injury, for which Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel, from 18 meters just above the housing, and after an hour the goods slother also appeared on the offensive for the first time.
After a major conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz it was fixed.
"Nick Flock (62)" crowns the quickly performed Konter over Sinan Aygün with a slight shot into the arms of the RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a Wieckowicz (66th) football after a corner ball by former ancestor Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It did - nothing.
The ancestors did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but that didn't bring anything.
Angelo Daut tried to underline the positive: "I like the fact that we have played to zero", but unfortunately the zero was at the front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against wood development and this even though our opponent did not want to play with us," said RW Ahlen's interim trainer.
Offensive "appealed everything so a bit" against a team that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not feel that we could achieve an opposite, "says Daut.
But, to his shame, the audience did not feel as though his team could score a goal.
The idea was too weak.
Reckenfeld ’ s Harvest Market: Fortunately enough Kremers exist.
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld blackboard office for which these donations are intended are pleased.
The honorary assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky was shining blue, while the space was still somewhat empty, but that should change in the course of the day..
Because: "Here it's so nice to socialise, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holhaust welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as usual with a good sense of humour.
For the couple Brockmann, who was supposed to be weighed up for food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer intervened in the short term.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) became ill.
But there are enough of them.
And the "replacement" could not be taken to entertain the growing number of visitors musically.
This was so good that at the late hour some folk songs were sung.
"Simply great", Marcel Kreimer was delighted.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer placed the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is happy about the many activities with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"Actually there should be no such thing as a blackboard", he nevertheless thanked the male choir for the action.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who worked at the stands and also included the further celebrations and the "Clean Up" action that took place in.
Our garden town is colourful - there is something going on here.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took the corn counter with the help of the fire brigade and brought it to the winter quarter.
Many stands were used for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heart everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decapier saw.
He had a range of veneer work, a beer lid with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more.
A speciality was offered by three reckenfelder beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershaven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a speciality.
Honeycake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access time and time again, so tasty the cake.
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage programme that is not available during the autumn festival.
Lubrication with a local political message: no successful advertising of skateequipment
In Len, unknowns have promoted the construction of a skate facility in a way that is hardly profitable.
According to Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN, there are a number of blacksmiths.
In at least one case, the police have been subject to criminal notification of property damage.
In large letters, the three words "skate park for Len!" have been printed on signs, including the Gemptt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding inscription has already been discovered on the advertising sign at the entrance to the Gempt-Bistro after the professional election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an Edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, this was back, this time sprayed up," says Rottmann.
It assumes that the relevant advertising sign must be replaced.
This is particularly notable for the fact that several large companies from Len are also listed on the table.
If the skate facility is built, it should also be made possible by sponsors.
Commitments have already been made, explained Jörg Hesselmann of the urban school, sport and culture departments, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies on the awarded board.
For years local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old one at the LWL clinic was dismantled, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the majority of the Council spoke in favour of the fire parking lot.
However, this was not implemented - too many factors apparently opposed construction here.
There was a U-turn at the end of June.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the premises of the Gutenberg School.
On the state of affairs, Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then comes from the town council.
It is based on a decision this year, so a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Making Worse, the Flight Control Shortage
Frankfurt / Hamburg Following the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm," said the chief of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency, before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and failures in flights is the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training for new pilots will take four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained pilots is empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, some hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the Federal Government, the Länder, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic City to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, this will not be possible without us," explained the head of the GDF, who has many members at the Federal German Air Safety Agency.
Maas again blamed EU Commission guidelines for the piloting plight.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings at national flight insurance companies have now been fully integrated into the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to push for regulations in Brussels that "do not further reduce air safety".
At the moment, the EU targets would be agreed by 2024, and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant pressure from airlines to lobby.
"Ryan's boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high costs of delay will lead to a change of thinking on the part of the airlines.
The GDF will only help to improve the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
The annual admission of 120 pilots over the next five years, which has been announced so far, is sufficient to compensate for age-related drops.
The necessary recruitment is not yet connected with this.
ThyssenKrupp Supervisory Board Vote for Group Restructuring
The members of the Thyssen Krupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
The will of Thyssen's interim chief executive, Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, is to split the crisis group into two separate companies.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no further reduction in staff beyond the cuts already known in administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory board counts only eight heads on the capital side.
There are ten employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new ThyssenKrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50% share from the merged steel business with Tata, an Indian partner.
The second company, ThyssenKrupp Industrials AG, is to combine its elevator and supply business.
Barcelona: Violence against demos of police and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations in Barcelona by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters have involved violent clashes with many injured.
According to the city council, on Saturday, around 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered, as well as around 6,000 pro-independence protesters.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protests from one another with a huge amount of money.
According to the forces, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officials with paint and throwing shots.
According to the figures, there were also rankings between the participants in the various protests.
According to the rescue services, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and allowances for colleagues
In their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to those colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Civil Guard feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn considerably more than they do.
The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona, of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protestant Manel Perez of AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and to celebrate the fact that a year ago they sank us.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to name himself only with Daniel, rejected the charge.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who only did their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne permitted access to British ministers ’ personal data
A security gap in a mobile app has meant that personal data was temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday by ministers and members of the British Conservative Tory Party.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory Party Congress in Birmingham.

Football: Juve trainers praise Ronaldo ’ s Best Game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3: 1 (1: 1) victory of the record master against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the highly purchased star was also the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is good," said Allegri.
Although we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal templates, Juve turned the game after the early lag by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst runner for the time being.
Real Madrid coach Mario Mandzukic, a former Bundesliga professional, first set up the team with a double pack (26 / 49).
Ronaldo also did the preparatory work for the match of Chief of Defense Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had to hit the front line just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates", praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals of the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of record defenders.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach said.
The best juve archer is now Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in his account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than €100 million, the superiority of Juventus seems to be even more pressing.
Seven wins in seven games is the immaculate series A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six meters ahead of Naples.
The second table, trained by the former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the end of the qualifying session of Mario Rui (58.), who had already been thrown, the first.
The Portuguese had to get up too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the place.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
There was also the possibility to feel attracted by Emre Can.
The German national player won Juve.
The professional from Liverpool FC was in action on all seven League games.
Ronaldo was also a midfielder in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2: 0 victory of the Turines and is locked for the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
The West Changing its Name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, Rapper Kanye West captured attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his performance together with Lil Pump caused eyebrows and question marks among the spectators in a mineral water costume.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From then on he can only be called "Yes", so the musician.
"The creature that used to be known as the Kanye West," he tweeted to the late singer Prince when he gave up his name.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Yes" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Yes "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you ", says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Get it done!
Hoetmar ’ s coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a poor game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more effective, we almost never posed him problems ".
With two or more chances of scoring in 90 minutes, it is rarely possible games.
Bundesliga A1: SC Hoetmar is SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) photo: Heinz Schwackenberg.
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but the first was to use Maik Krause from a pointed angle for early guidance (7).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have raised, but after great preparatory work by Krause he decided to hang up freely.
The hosts had only a double chance when Moritz Höne, an goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher, first failed and Jan Blome also found his master in the sendenhorster Keeper in the.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all gave.
A trade metre - Louis Kortenjann had rescued with his hand on the front line and saw red - moreover, Niklas Eilmann could not use it for the guests either (75).
It was only when Nils Berheide shot the ball over the line that the game was decided (81.).
"We had criticised each other hard before, but that was different today than in the last few weeks," read Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Gates: 0: 1 Krause (7.), 0: 2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75. / Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle Football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is Concordia with 3: 4.
"I don't know what to think about it," he said.
"We didn't get access to it at all," he said, presumably, the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites with a collective offensive drive.
He was still able to laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, "a stingy cheeky, and attracted danish players to note the relief that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, namely Albachs, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class preservation.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0: 2, how we keep against one of the top teams of the league over the whole time, that was really phenomenal".
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to drive home empty-handed.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner led the host with his 12th season encounter (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2: 0 he set up on the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but such a player cannot be taken out completely.
"This was madness, what he did," Lewandowski flatly recognized the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the side change, his own elf managed to balance: McGill's freekick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concorde goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long Toreck (45.).
After the change of sides it was McGill again who achieved the balance (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a tight, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann met (69th).
However, Alberslow did not manage to beat the last Concorde hit (80) again.
We must now focus on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdets is what we must win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Gates: 1: 0 Zymner (24.), 2: 0 Fröhning (39.), 2: 1 McGill (45.), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 Nübel (64.), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow red: Atalan (74. / Albachts).

Erdoğan in Germany ’ s Politics, Not Pomp
It is good that it is gone again.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent Guests and New Offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he will personally collect the tolerance price in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutsi ’ s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was there.
This is how Academic Director Udo Hahn appointed him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellor were already with us".
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin alarmer takes part in a meeting on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective. On 29 September, the writer Frido Mann attended a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
France ’ s president, Emmanuel Macron, has now pledged to personally receive the Academy ’ s “Tolerance Award ” in Tutzing, which, in another category, also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings between now and the middle of 2019 are in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is stated in a conference title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - the Academy describes the "risky and lethal route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria:" barbarism without limit ".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war makes a mockery of any humane idea '.
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to radical changes in work through digitization.
Academic Director Hahn convinced himself that a free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to seek solutions or at least partial solutions.

Music cabaret: Heart Gender Understanding - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christian Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret star, Teubner introduced himself to gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and (felt) man and whatever else there may be, but also with music.
The mini-guitar used her and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrup sat on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks up to the end of the sentence, and on the other hand a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner, so congenially harmonically accompanied, that some might have wished for a solo.
That was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but it was different, the way it was the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had put a paradox into play: satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo is now demonstrating the same thing: What would have emerged from the composing of Mozart if "the Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp glisses in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart's g-minor Symphony into a playful dancer.
There was great applause and bravo from the full room.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea of giving the duo a chance to perform in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as in Wolbeck.

Handball: Damen Bundesliga: Ahlener SG stets narrowly the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The girls had problems with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten matches.
"Actually I was happy with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We have not got them under control, "says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry about the many missed opportunities.
This time his team was not focused at the end.
Therefore, the ASG was almost behind to the end, behind the break with 11: 12 and later with 15: 18 (45).
Only towards the end did the broader host bank make a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu placed the back space of Merle Klement on the left, which then "made the decisive goals extremely clever" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlutmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Rushhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd Women League: top performance of the BSV Ostbevern at the World Cup Essen.
The volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West thanks to a top performance in the top game.
At the second league entry VC Allbau Essen the blue whites won 3: 1.
"This was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
This is what we have worked out, "coach Dominik Münch rejoiced after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the shortened table leader.
The first passage was dominated by guests almost at will.
He went over 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 to last year's vice-champion at 25: 15.
Food has been accepted in the second level, but has not come into play.
We have done a good job of it.
Our opponent started with high risk but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence the BSV already led with 12: 8. "Essen changed the acceptance to triple seal.
We could not keep the pressure on charges.
Food has become a matter of concern, and we have let ourselves be lulled in a little, "says Münch.
At 18: 17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had the first time the front.
At 19: 24, Ostbevern resisted four matches, but the fifth attempt was his goal.
"The game was now a class better," the practice manager said to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and, finally, Wiebke Silge, contributed significantly with their impacts that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly here".
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13, the Blue White pass brought four at 25: 22 to their side.,,, and.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV-Frauen: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea und Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Municipality: Mosque-opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a shambles in German-Turkish relations that can only be painstakingly swept together," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the opportunity to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing Muslims ’ membership of Germany alongside German leaders, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The far-reaching exclusion of the German public has "reinforced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already become established.
After the long summer break, there is finally a time for follow-up.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m. the Heimatverein Nottuln is already organizing its fifth Nottulner Folktrum in the fireplace room of the Alte Ammannei.
It was one year ago, almost to the day, that we carried out a follow-up operation for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln, "says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn ’ t have thought that our tortoff would shine so quickly in Nottuln.
No matter whether Storm Friederike in January or Heat wave in July, the Ammannei ’ s fireplace room was always.
"As always, the programme at the next Torture is a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old drummers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who regularly invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer and his accordion promised for the first "birthday of the folk band".
He was a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from the neighbouring district Steinfurt, who played music with record German lyrics.
Now he is travelling with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the folk movement are pleased to remember the last event in summer when Christoph Schulz of the folk band Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" impressed the audience and sent home with an earworm.
"We count on many happy guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening again", says the invitation of the home association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be actively involved is invited to participate.
As the desired seats are always filled quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.

China ’ s Approved Linde and Praxair Fusion
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step towards becoming the world's largest industrial gas company.
China ’ s competition authority approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that permits in South Korea and, as the biggest obstacle, in the United States still stand for the billionaire merger.
Most recently, an insider said that there was a better chance of an insider's agreement, because Linde promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October if the merger is to succeed.
From pure fruit to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the Association for Gardening and State Administration was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger Hall.
On September 29, 1893, the last impulse for establishing the district association for horticulture and state care Kulmbach was set with a show of fruit at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
In 1893, Mayor Wilhelm Flessa baptised him as "District Obstacles Society of Kulmbach City and Land".
The purpose of the fruit growing association also differed from today's work - it was in fact a question of fruit growing, flowers and horticulture that no one thought about at that time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites," said District Home Secretary Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees were to line roads, and industrial gardens were created at schools.
Fruit growing is still the responsibility of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But that is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an important role as well as the teaching of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer Youth Group "Maulden" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said District Chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important nature experiences are for life.
The box collection was a huge issue for us children, and I doubt that you will be able to enjoy the same amount with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner.
"Where they should stand, it is the Kreisverband that decides", added Landrat Söllner and stressed the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt as to the fact that the district manager and expert adviser Friedhelm Haun had.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a presentation of the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was poured in.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature has survived, it was here before us and we must follow it", the expert said for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up so that our homeland remains beautiful and liveable.
In addition, the President of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl, added that we should welcome the new citizens to our clubs.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the towers of the music club Thurnau.

Priority on NAFTA: Canada ’ s Secretary of State moves UN speech
Mexico ’ s government wants clarity on NAFTA: they are putting an ultimatum to both trading partners for an agreement.
Canada's Secretary of State now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of time in the struggle to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Secretary of State Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the United Nations General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking before the United Nations General Assembly this Saturday, the Minister announced to her spokesman Adam Austen.
Meanwhile, it is focusing on the renegotiation of NAFTA.
Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that if Canada really wants to join the trade agreement that has already been concluded between its country and the US, Canada's negotiators and the US would have 48 hours to agree.
The US and Mexico agreed in August to recast the NAFTA regional free-trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
Discussions on a new version have been going on for more than a year.
They are now to be concluded by Sunday night (local time), and Trump ’ s administration wants to submit the deal to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico ’ s President-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests Against Presidential Candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a trade fair attack, has left the hospital.
The extreme right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform publicly in South America last week before the presidential election.
At the beginning of September, the politician had been assaulted on the street during a campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations in particular called for protests against the ex-military.
Bolsonaro was the first woman to win the World Cup.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers ’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inacio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As an ex-mayor of São Paulo, Haddad has been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
The "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in politics, but has recently become an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round, there will be a runoff on October 28.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully, no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for his hatred of homosexuals and blacks and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Time and again he is shocked by verbal derailments.
On another occasion, he said that followers of Lula's leftist Workers' Party should be shot.

After Long Disease: Danish Rock Legend Dead
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen informed on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children on the deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become famous with the band Gasolin, which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music stars like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's dissolution in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the most sold album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister, Lars Lökke Rasmussen, praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a 'street boy' who was' against everything but in all hearts'.

Rocknight in the shoe factory: Volume at the level of compressed air hammers
The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik.
After the soundcheck and shortly before the concert begins, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace of stage fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands will delight the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the newest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band will perform in harmony and intensity.
"Tiger Bonesaw" will leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Hard rock is not the same as hard rock, but guitar player Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meielenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of the classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", a synthesizer is also used at "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar skirt.
Not only the longlasting, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change of melodic passages to the guitar heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuchen has earned a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
On Saturday, the band will be presenting their hard rock with full agility.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances to a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis on the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
In cooperation with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann sets new accents for the only recorded song of the evening, "Word Up" from Cameo from the 80s.
In addition to the soulful sound, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a acclaimed solo while running through the audience.
A certain volume is part of this kind of hardrock concert due to the frequency of the band. According to the information of the mixing desk team, the "Mint Mosquito" rock night is about 98 decibels at the three concerts of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition".
This is at the level of pneumatic hammers, for example, but is still significantly below the control of the "Wacken-spec", to which "The Ignition" is referred on its website.
This rock night, however, does not require the ears numbing 120 decibels in nozzle volume, as is the case with the annual metal seal in the north of the republic.
After less than four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and set off a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say at the end, figuratively, of course.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A Sailplane Accident Toter at Essen / Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Essen Airport.
A sailplane crashed on Sunday at a car park at Mülheim / Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
There was a fatal accident near the airport of Mülheim / Essen on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider crashed at the airport's parking lot.
The pilot died.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the student was alone on board - the plane should be a single-seater.
The aircraft was already in the landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance away from a tent on the airport grounds.
But since this weekend there has been an October festival.
Mülheim / Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr cities and directly on the driveway to the A2 motorway.
From the parking lot there is a Park & Ride offer at major events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump is skyrocketing Kim: "And then we fell in love."
The fact that North Korea ’ s president, Kim, is well disposed despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
Now Trump has made a real love statement to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kims "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president announced a new flame.
The tragedy: it is a distant relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump publicly offered North Korean leader Kim Jong-un an unusual declaration of love.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost incensed words for the semi-old pyromaniac of Pyongyang ’ s ruling dynasty, though the struggle for North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament is proving to be a rather tough chunk.
“I was tough, he was, and we went back and forth, ” Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, indeed.
And it is not only talks with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote beautiful letters to me, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim ’ s announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests, though critics have so far paid little more than lip service.
The US president seemed well aware that the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" – Trump ’ s nickname for Kim – might not be palatable to everyone.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That is so unpresidential.
But he didn ’ t care much about it, Trump said, and then pointed his finger at the crowd: “I have always told you it ’ s so easy to be presidential. ”
But then there would not be 10 000 people out there in this crowded arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.
October attracts many guests to Baesweiler.
Baesweiler Bestens visited, impressed and also spoiled by sun: On Sunday, Baesweiler city centre was plastered with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not just take place in the marquee at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Saved Refugees by Video from Libyan Prison
Nigerian refugees, using a mobile phone video, have highlighted their catastrophic conditions of detention in Libya, enabling them to be rescued.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally sent to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to enter Europe via the Mediterranean.
He was the only one who was able to get his life under threat with the video.
One of his companions was almost beaten to death by the authorities, said Onyeka.
Generally speaking, the conditions of detention were disastrous: 'You beat us all with pipes and sticks'.
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organising the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria had been sent back home this year through the program, said the IOM speaker in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of Nigerians now rescued is not exceptional in view of Libya ’ s poor prison conditions.
He hasn't heard of a mobile phone call yet.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libya ’ s refugee camps as degrading.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her classes for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At around 16: 50 the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the hall of the 1st floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.
Date description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark t-shirt.
Please contact the police inspection at Obernberg am Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
For days, Germans were trapped in their own car
A 75 year old man had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in central Franconia after having stuck the car off the beaten track and a tree blocked the car door.
On Saturday afternoon rescue workers accidentally discovered the car near a pasture and freed those who had been missing since Tuesday evening, the police informed on Sunday.
According to the data, the 75 year old person from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he would now look forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported by his family as missing after he had not returned from a trip on Tuesday with his 4x4 across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive searches, the man ’ s whereabouts remained unclear for days.
The Rule of Law in Turkey
Cologne Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has stated that he is calling for the rule of law in Turkey.
The two countries' relations are currently 'overshadowed', said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This particularly concerns the waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore 'made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this'.
According to his own data, Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan subsequently reaffirmed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence ’ s readiness to fly at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn – but the castle owners rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Following the conversation, Erdogan continued to attend the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
However, he said: 'The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country'.
We are also their contacts - not the Turkish President.
Missing Confidence in the US: North Korea Calling for Disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the success of negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to be accommodating.
North Korea ’ s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the US government in the UN general debate of blocking negotiations on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with continued sanctions.
"The recent stalemate is due to the fact that the US is relying on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable in these circumstances for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that sanctions could 'bring North Korea to its knees' is' a pipe dream of people who do not know us'.
But, to build confidence, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
On the US side, however, there have been no "corresponding reactions", the minister criticized.
For North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council decided three times last year alone to impose sanctions on the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, have been pressing the United Nations for strict compliance with sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working toward convergence.
In June, Trump first met North Korea ’ s leader, Kim Jong-un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on ending North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT Serves: New kitchen with community donations
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting was something of which the many visitors of the House of the Open Door got nothing from HoT: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet was waiting for the guests after the Harvest Service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was funded by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank them for their food.
The launch of the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power failure had disabled the huge two-part refrigerator, the food had dried up and had to be disposed of.
"Now we have had to start again from scratch: we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it on their own," says Westbuer.
And so they all took part.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"It's not possible to cook better," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were served with quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said priest Frank Beckmann, while wizards have surprised Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW state board.
Out of frustration with criticism from our own ranks, Jörg Sartor, the chief of the Essen Tafel, left his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known throughout Germany because the Essen Tafel had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as a deputy head of the NRW blackboards, said Sartor to the "World on Sunday".
I have fallen in the back of too many of them.
The head of the National Association of North Rhine-Westphalia, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-time deputy at dpa.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - people who did not know why the Essen blackboard is doing so have spoken.
But Sartor is still active for the Essen Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday" Sartor once again criticized criticism of colleagues from other blackboards.
We must not adopt the approach 'without us the people of the city starve'.
It is up to the state to ensure that people do not starve.
He did not attend a congress of the blackboards in Berlin on Friday.
"I am told too much sweet dirt," he said.
There are all the social fuzzis that criticised me so much at the time.

Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change the name of their country in North Macedonia.
A yes vote could resolve the nearly three decades of simmering conflict with Greece ’ s neighbor.
Athens insisted on a change of name because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any rapprochement of Macedonia with the West.
Voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum had a positive outcome.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahr marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahr married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave their way to Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership had not been considered for her, Kahr had previously told the "picture" newspaper.
"If we marry, then it is right," he has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahr is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokespersons of the Seeeimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the federal debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahr had caused a rage on June 30, 2017.
Thus, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the topic.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples, like heterosexuals, can marry.
Prior to that, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with regard to adoption law.
Gardening Day: Cut 400 meters Heck
There was a lot of work before the members of the civic association Kinderhaus and the society for leprosy.

And a lot of things have accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a cut.
As early as the spring, the hedges were already shocking.

"Everyone should remain as strong as possible," said Walter Schröer.

Fail at Hertha: Revised by Reality: Bavaria vs. Ajax
The title is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern to "not let go".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim result for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small performance delle under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase to the greater autumn depths for Munich.
"A week ago we still had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we have a bit of the reality, "Thomas Müller noted after the 0-2 win at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are gasping for Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal has been scored abroad, as at the same time of the early season two mandatory matches in series without victory, the lead in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of Carlo Ancelotti ’ s failure at the end of September 2017, the record-keeper must be warned.
The FC Augsburg on 1: 1 with its intense man-to-man tactics and the Berliner with their playful needle stiches over the outside have delivered two blue pauses within three days, just as the last overmighty Bayern are to be cracked.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we will not tolerate this and we will do everything we can to ensure that we succeed again," said Kovac.
But he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city, and only pushed his first defeat as Munich coach to the once again poor handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still be positive before the national match break the first interim result of his term of office - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse.
So, before the second premier class appearance of this season after the 2: 0 at Benfica Lisbon, Kovac did not take exceptional steps either.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round of the preliminary match against Ajax, which had also successfully defeated Athens with 3: 0 at the start of the season,.
"Now we have caught up in two games, but we are also going to do our goals," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost Pokalfinal against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly.
The right defender played a Mahner role.
"I don't think this is all bad, we have to work out it again, because we don't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes behind the scenes," stressed the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bavaria was already behind Dortmund with five meters, which has now taken the lead by one point.
And so Kimmich valued with a wink at least positive that the public debate about Bavaria ’ s supposedly invincible has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's a good thing," said the national player.
It is good for the league.
DFB-Boss in firing line: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel.
The Turkish President, Mr Erdogan, has made serious allegations of the marginalisation of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the authority to interpret Mesut Özil on a permanent basis.
After the Turkish President severely criticised the handling of the former World Champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the head of the German Association defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, Özil personally attacked Grindel in the Mainzer ZDF, "Sportstudio", announced consequences from the Causa.
"Since we also have many players with a migrant background in the U-teams, we must draw very precise conclusions that such a thing will not happen again in the future," said the 57-year-old, who wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another coordinator of integration.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had in sharp words denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they allowed themselves to be photographed with me in England, "Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Frankly, as her President, I could not condemn the exclusion of our two young men, who have joined the German national team.
He was a member of the National League of Nations, and a member of the National League of Nations.
At the same time, he announced that he would face players in the future.
That someone says: if I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
I have always said that we should have defended Mesut more.
However, he does not see any basis for the return of Özils to the national team.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration representative is to be appointed.
"If one without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of it ", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration has to work," said Grindelwald.
Despite his criticism of himself after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he plans to run for the post of DFB president again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as possible," said Grindel.
Three accidents per year in three hours
Coburg / Rödental - According to police reports, the 75 year old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
First, the 75 year old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the area of Lauter.
He told the pensioner that he had gone against their car.
The room was very small and the bed was very uncomfortable.
A short time later, a telephone message was sent to the police about a driver who had left the road and drove against a post.
To address this, the man did not want a police force on the ground and then drove away from it.
After that the Rödentaler went home.
However, in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, the pensioner has gone and picked up a building vehicle when turning.
After all, the police could find and stop him.
His car was severely damaged by accidents.

The damage is approximately 1300 Euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 people still in service.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a German military site in the Emsland, 980 troops are still involved in the extinguishing work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
According to one speaker, the situation is still stable, so 70 volunteers were last withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of staff is planned, they say.
During the night to Sunday, a above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was announced just over a week earlier on 21 September, because it was feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and radio.
On Thursday it was said that the fire would no longer threaten to attack adjacent communities.
At some time more than 1500 local forces tried to control the big fire.
The Luftwaffe will continue to support work on the Bundeswehr test area near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the German Armed Forces, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorfire was temporarily drawn up to one hundred kilometres far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr intends to set up a contact point to receive claims for damages.
The first claims for damages have already been announced by hoteliers and holiday owners.

"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples, like heterosexuals, can marry.
Prior to that, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with regard to adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia on new names
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state began.
Some 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should in future be called North Macedonia.
This is due to its northern province of neighbouring Greece.
For nearly three decades, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO as a means.
If the citizens vote 'yes', they will also give the starting signal for their country's Western integration.

Switzerland Starts Electronic Register of Organ Donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs can only be taken from the body with express consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on members in stress situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken from organs only with express consent, as in Germany, emphasises Swisstransplant.
According to Franz Always, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation, 15 percent of Swiss citizens are expected to have a donor card.
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60% of the conversations the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You will then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," he says.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are plans to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be regarded as organ donors, unless he or she disagrees with family members.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old World Champion in Headcount
The 14 year old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in his head calculation.
He won the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
On Sunday, the Martina Flamme-Jasper was announced by the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue for the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The latest World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 70-year-old French retiree, as the main judge Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
For example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already present in Bielefeld two years ago when he was 14 years old.
Organiser Laue can do little with terms like superbrain, genius or prodigy.
"Headcount can be trained," he said.
Many participants practised several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium computer competitions.
For example, square root drawing from six-digit numbers is one of the disciplines.
When calculating the versatility, candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to find a solution quickly.
The main judge said that the Germans also had a good chance here.
Otherwise, Asians are often in favor, because they learn head calculus more intensively and with other, effective methods even in early childhood.
Strong appeal: video with naked Serena Williams: it is about breast cancer screening.
Tennis Ass Serena Williams shows her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to highlight breast cancer and make a strong case for early detection.
It is about life and death, but it is also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only their hands cover their most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amhlett died of this.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which deals with breast cancer screening that can save lives.
Serena Williams himself died almost a year ago.
There were complications when her daughter, Alexis Olympia, was born.
An emergency operation was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clumps in Serena's lung were discovered.
Just in time...
Government ’ s Banning More Extremist Symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will issue an appropriate bill on the so-called 'symbol law' in review.
This is intended to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar Cold Air ’ s Rise of Snow in the West
Mrs Holle will be shaking her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snow fall line drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it is said that it can cut down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern mountain range, new snow can be expected above 2,000 metres with 20 to 40 centimetres.
On higher pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore wintry.
Farmers Can Start the Annual Knicking on Monday
On Monday, Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual needlework.
The "green forests", unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the country with a low forest level for about 200 years.
The tree and thicket hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are "forest substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last retreat areas.
As the director of the German Nature Protection Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwig, said, Knicks connect scattered habitats through which the exchange of organisms can still work.
Knicks Are Living Fences
The Knicks were built on the basis of a command of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who reigned over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fences; they also supplied firewood and beams for their timber houses.
His name "Knick" comes from that time: by "bending" the branches the dense, interweaving boundaries could develop.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, around 45 000 kilometres of hedges provide a picture of a rich and varied landscape.
According to NABU, around 7000 species have now used them as a substitute for life.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre of Knick and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly maintained in winter.
In other words, he withers into a small series of trees which, besides biodiversity, wind, wind protection, says. wind, wind,,,,,,,
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kneading is only permitted outside the breeding period from October to March.
After the tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia talks about SITuation on the ground.
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local radical Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you on the spot during the tsunami?
No, at that time I was in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport on Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have descended on surrounding hills, where they are still stuck for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their homes and there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and petrol stations are completely closed, some people steal food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the detainees are free and it is difficult to find them.
Many bodies are still lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does the communication and information on the island work?
At the moment we have a mobile reception, but before that did not work and we only received information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who do not know if they are living and where they are, because during the earthquakes people were not at home but, for example, on work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "okay, not a tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
However, every day there are earthquakes, but that was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, and the earthquake has hit a great many people.
FC Bayern München: VfL Bochum have been awarded the Champions League title of the UEFA Champions League.
VfB Stuttgart will miss Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo with serious muscle injuries for a long.
On Saturday, the German football league announced that Aogo had taken a muscular fibrosis in the rear left thigh against Werder Bremen.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle pack in the thighs.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss out after the next national match break.
VfB Stuttgart did not issue a forecast for the sell-out period.
As a rule, a muscle bundle rupture heals within six to eight weeks, and a muscle fibrous rupture usually healed a little faster.
The triumph of hyper-realism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The film festival of San Sebastián concludes the annual excitement of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the sounds on the cinema, one can sum up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the fire brigade in Olching tried to catch a wounded duck.
However, the action went on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
On Sunday morning, a white injured duck was spotted by walking along Lake Olchinger.
It remained in the area of the water monitoring station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
The first attempts to capture the duck, however, went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the forces of the armed forces.
In the end she fled to the lake.
With a rescue boat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to the land, where it was then put into a transport box by a fireman with a bold handle after almost an hour.
The duck injured at the chest was then taken to the LMU animal clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But, according to initial estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard peilt World Championship medal
The fourth place at Olympia was Biathlete Julian Eberhard in the stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter the Saalfelden wants to catch up with the lost precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the medal to grasp.
Seven tenths of seconds were missing on bronze at the end.
"I have deliberately given myself time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym Fitness Studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to return with the constitution to a major event, to win something.
At some point we have to strike.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "The track I have already closed to the heart", he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the last year.
Immediately after Olympia he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season he took second place in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI inquiry in the Turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
The Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a razor-thin majority for Brett Kavanaugh, the US Senate ’ s Supreme Court ’ s controversial bill of coercion, by means of investigation.,,, and.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline of Friday to investigate alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama surrounding the appeal of Kavanaugh, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer stepped out of angry rants against opposition Democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative Supreme US judge.
The Republican majority seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who called Thursday ’ s severe reprimands “Beschiss, ” initially abstained from further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of“ happiness in disaster. ”
In this way, last doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, in an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy. ”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh ’ s case
The White House has also severely limited the powers of investigators.
One government representative said to the Wall Street Journal: 'They are not going to go fishing'.
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.

FC Schalke 04: The fear has been felt.
The coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory in the season.
But Mainz also played a role against the time factor.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I have seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room, "said the Sports Board of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
After all, the royal blue had still succeeded in securing a close 1: 0 against the Rhine bosses over time and thus the first season victory.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given security to the team of chief coach Domenico Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and pressing".
Don ’ t Make a Headball Monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand."
The guys were afraid to give this out of their hands and therefore kept on withdrawing.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant share of it with his headball hit: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the man creation".
But in the end it is only victory that counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including, of course, Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make a fireworks display out of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
Victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and boldly, so we have to take over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Royal Blue missed to worry for clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example, by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who met twice the Latte 59. / 72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a victory for quotes," Tedesco said: "You have already felt the fear a bit".
I am therefore pleased that we have won.
This meant that he was not the only shaker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzach Valley 2 km visible
The smoke was not visible.
From about two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday at around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion on an equal footing
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffen" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance to organise the evening.
El-Mafaalani goes into reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gesture, tangible figures and a certain joke, he brings one of the most conflictual subjects closer to the audience: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are conflicts increasingly arising?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society is sitting at one table, and first-generation migrants are at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat around the big table and now want to be part of the decision-making.
That leads to conflict.
It is therefore not a matter of whether one is politically right or left, but of 'Am I for or against an open society?', he stresses.
At the beginning, we are getting more and more busy.
And there is talk.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell us how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani, not on stage, is a symbol of the discussion: it is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, stresses that he talks about the average, not individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because 'only when we understand what the problem is, can we find solutions', says El-Mafaalani.
During the signing session he also listened to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, where prepared Kurdish specialities were discussed intensively.

Munich was already struggling for an 83: 77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Franconerby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84: 80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots.
The demand is obviously huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the plots in Landsham-South.
The Municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-Süd area on the open market.
This is communicated by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase has been completed for the 20 plots that the community offers at more favourable conditions or prices, similar to the former housing model.
More than 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
"The documents are currently being checked" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Mayor of Plienburg, the aim is to have drawn up the ranking of the 20 properties by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
Then it can be awarded.
In the south of Landsham, a total of 50 plots are being created for single and double houses, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with an estimated eight units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads are to be paved soon.
A single property and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the community Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the community ’ s two multi-family houses are to be built as an affordable living space.
With a total of 16 fully subsidized, income-oriented apartments.
Place 200 People
It is highly estimated that the area of the new Landsham-Süd area will create housing for about 200 people.
Not only that: now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of a new nursery is being made there.
It is intended to accommodate three nursery and three cribs groups, as well as a room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
As a result, Schalke's' Great Sport 'is also successful at the Bank.
For the third time in succession not in the starting eleven: Nevertheless, Naddo thanks Schalke-Rainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not been sitting in the Schalker Startelf for the third time in a row, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the Brazilian, who is almost two meters tall, had really felt the frustration of the soul.
But when Schalker players gathered in the middle after the 1: 0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 as usual and chief coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who is all easy to call Naldo, turned in and said: "We have to thank, coaches!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later commented on the reaction of his vice-captains, who, despite his renewed reservist existence, had no grudges.
Problích knows Naldo, who was the best Schalker in the last season, that he did not actually get on a losing track with his coach - he gets a break for good reasons.
One reason is' burden control '.
It was not easy to tell him.
"It was not easy to tell him that, I say this to you in all honesty," Tedesco said from the moment he told Naldo that he was not on the grid.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club ", Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone is able to run through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat ", Tedesco explained the rotation that also caught Naddo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by acting as an exemplary team player on the bank as well.
The mood in Austria ’ s industry continued to decline faster than in the eurozone in August.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was at 46.7 points at a 37-month low.
Despite this, Austria has the third best sentiment behind Ireland and the Netherlands, according to the Markit Institute on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, which means that for the 13th consecutive month the index is below the 50 meter mark indicating growth.
The only industry in Ireland hit this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
Last was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France, and Spain, the mood barometer fell more slowly than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March, at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened descent may well mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one brake on growth, at least in the third quarter.
There is no prospect of a rapid return to the growth zone: export orders in the eurozone have fallen as fast as they have since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
In China, too, industrial production fell more sharply in August than was initially thought.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Amongst other things, developments in sales, employment, storage and prices are being highlighted.
