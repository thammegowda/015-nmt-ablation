Munich 1856: Four Maps to Change your View of the City
This is a misleading institution where young people are to meet today.
A crypt chapel where the tunnel is dug.
Small gardeners manage the former farm.
Munich ’ s oldest official map promotes exciting stories.
It is annoying when maps are not up to date.
Everyone who has had to get up and running is aware of this, because the auto-Navi was showing a green meadow instead of a by-pass.
The historic maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer by the Bavarian Geoportal of the State Government, are far from up-to-date - but that is precisely why they are very revealing.
Especially when compared to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-atlas is a patchwork quilt that you do not recognize as such.
In the large overview map more detailed maps, known as initial position sheets, were incorporated for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian survey administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and were the result of the first survey of Bavaria.
Its patron: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and ordered a topographical admission of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops ultimately withdrew with the Lunéville peace of February 9, 1801, it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a universal Bayer map.
Elector Max IV. Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian survey administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library, like all the others.
The comparison between the former and the present is most impressive in the case of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated into Munich as a district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears when zooming in: handwritten-numbered plots from the so-called "original picture" from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers, but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" facility.
A large green area is north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, which has been the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the river Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of the current district of Au-Haidhausen, you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irmen Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße one once imprisoned people with delusions.
The Munich Kreis-Irsenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded in 1858 / 59.
In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Louis II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chain of so-called astray.
In addition, he has prohibited the personnel from using force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked with the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients there was room at first, later it was enlarged to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the hairpin nunnery in 1905.
Since 2006 there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany.
On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with training facilities.
To the west lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the "Casa Don Bosco" children's house was erected, built according to the architectural style of the original Irenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War during the bombing.
The Marienplatz was named "Haupt Platz" in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs ripped many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small stores and a medieval crypt chapel were once located at the Marienhof, where the preparatory work was carried out these days, and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn train station.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with today's aerial picture - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled up.
Citizens ’ Rights Group Published Travel Warning to Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People has issued a warning to those who travel to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when travelling through the state, as a series of questionable, racist incidents have recently occurred and are recorded throughout the state," the group's opinion states.
NAACP said a recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination actions, as well as the state ’ s law enforcement agencies, which disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten up or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard. '
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racial offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black Tennessee man.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, having lost fuel during the state trip and being detained by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General ’ s Office showing that black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
'People must be prepared to bring bail or to let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state '.
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest data from the FBI ’ s hate crimes program, which ranked the state 16th in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violating immigration, which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidzan Project is Elementary
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU members of parliament, Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac, have gathered a picture on the spot.
Representatives of the local council of the Fischerbacher CDU met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the rights court of the Schwendemann family.
Markus Schwendemann initially gave an insight into his farm where he farm 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
According to Schwendemann, "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows.
Only regional dishes are served on the table of the holiday guests.
Since he is also chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidzunprojekt "elementary important".
I cannot operate profitably in such steep areas.
The green area provides a lot of work, much has to be done with the engine sensor.
"We have to deal with the conditions and the topography here," stressed Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over his parents' business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not run a biological operation.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunproject and is happy about the Leader promotion".
Farmers should be supported at a cost of between EUR 3 000 and 4 000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the area could be extended for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business," said the mayor.
Farmers are often criticised for promoting them.
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of land were fenced in by eleven participants.
This means that the open area is 40 hectares, which cannot be cleared up until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of €71 500, half was funded by Leader, while a quarter was carried by the community Fischerbach.
This left farmers with EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible".
Peter Weiß also said: "Here best food is produced".
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) in Baden-Württemberg enables state support for willow fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the existence of a funding framework designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced in must not be sustainable (slope over 35%) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbach Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.
The open area is 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now Trump ’ s White House Captains the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans like everyone else – hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to freedom in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta over the president ’ s proposals to slash legal immigration.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have lynched him if he had done so.
But it attacked its meaning, and especially the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
When Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. '
Miller is factually correct, but, as he put it, it is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: 'Your pains, your poor, / your beleaguered masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts'.
There was never a time when the "wretched waste" was better visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US.
This conflict, because of the importance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance.
Lazarus - and her friends who sought to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act.
The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.
The combination of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the people on the right wing wanted to change it a long time ago.
The grand scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for Trump ’ s coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neocon initiative that brings America ’ s flame to the world around it: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not clear the way to the United States. '
It is rather unusual for Limbaugh to come across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, wretched but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is literally a question of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and will that they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.
Their torch should not illuminate the path, but inflame hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team.
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team.
The UK ’ s performance director, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad will “make a massive contribution to the team. ”
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that 'something special is developing in Scotland' and that UK athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out," said Black.
"I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. '
Several of the Scottish athletes are candidates for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m stretch, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought to life, of course, was great. '
The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in her fifth World Cup at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland ’ s best total World Cup athletes so far has been seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, a medium-distance runner, is on the road and last year set five British and two European records.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, running 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Cup, when the only other Scot in Team Lee McConnell was.
The team captain says that she is "immensely proud" of the fact that many of her fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but also, in some cases, part of the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me makes it a very special thing for me," she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podium.
As for my speech as captain?
Yes, I think it went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a World Cup at home.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic.
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there. '
Block critics on Facebook: Don ’ t be in public office if you can ’ t tolerate voter heating.
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He railed with criticism, certainly.
But he has not silenced his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said: 'Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are being slaughtered like sheep'.
This brings me to Maryland and to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogan ’ s staff have blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
That is why the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a backlash with "Well, and?".
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it is important.
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation ’ s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also adept at using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters and play his hairless head on his side after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who join the governor's side - which is a public forum that is called official and paid for with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan ’ s spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor ’ s actions, arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who whip up the whip online.
The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profound.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD, was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news show "The Post.
'I do not appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then some people disregard it more as a so-called collective effort and do not recognise it as a large group of citizens concerned '.
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam attacks," others would probably call "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message simply by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that people were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that is precisely what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue was last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to US Vice President James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers appealed to his leadership.
Even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that quashed Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade, and shipping with Britain overtook his post, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project ’ s online papers.
But he has not silenced them.
Freedom of speech, difference of opinion and discourse are at the heart of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Raffty ’ s Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Raffproperty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Ireland, which led to the final round in the Archerfield next year, before losing Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and serves as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club ’ s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how it achieved its fame with this event," said Raffty.
"The players will see this course from its best side, it's in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he determined this place.
He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. '
The Englishman Eales looks forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said the Southport resident player.
"I could not defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
To come back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate. '
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home soil.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I am glad that this has happened. '
With the trio on the field are former Masters Winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNilty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free, parking costs £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Reduced lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
In the last two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer because of passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) are studying the results.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," study director Heiko Becher said.
In comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking in Germany every year.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Domestic connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in the Villinger Straße are in full swing and are "somewhat in time", according to the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of connection to the house, the situation is more complicated than expected, as there is a lot of hiding in the underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp construction team.
"The ignorance of drivers before red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But fortunately our friend Fritz Matt supplied us with cool mineral water, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia ’ s Golden Land
When Bardina Degei cooks the dinner, she does not use a stove.
It only rarely uses a single pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai rule in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed up with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she performs her daily work, for example, washing clothes with muddy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband ’ s four wives, she was not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villains are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody dares walk around after 5 p.m." she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand survey before the occupying forces.
An existing movement that stirred up independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is barren.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs transformed by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, pointing to her lively hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
'We used to have only leaves on our bodies'.
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a high-land province in New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport reduced gold and copper to $3.1 billion.
Papua also has an estimated $78 billion worth of timber resources.
But this wealth is a source of misery for Papua, which ensures that Indonesia ’ s powerful military retains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid almost $20 million to local military personnel and units, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are mercilessly treated.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua people have been killed, and thousands have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua ’ s tribal uplands in the 1970 ’ s became genocide, according to the Asia Commission on Human Rights.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
'We Will Lose All 'is stated in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which contains reports of last year's atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic trends are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese maintenance canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up with it.
"Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market at a lower price than local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to work in the provincial capital Jayapura.
"It has cost Papua's native - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, pledged during his 2014 campaign to address the inequalities and violations of rights in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs in front of a bonfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The terrified children told them to turn on their spotlights.
One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Temai.
The soldiers who had drunk chased and beat the group with their gunmen, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire, and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered in a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document from TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for calm and asked the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, who was a witness of the shooting.
"I ran to him and explored his body to make sure that he was," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name, to the TIME in a dark mood.
'I saw that he was dead... I kissed him '.
The chief police inspector, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the Papua police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
'It is about life and death '.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others injured.
The news about the killings only came to Jakarta the following day 'filtered'.
Three weeks, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to settle historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000 ’ s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through, "he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke with TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, 'everything is regulated by law', he said.
Wiranto, accused of "crimes against humanity" by the UN, claiming more than 1,000 lives in East Timor's bloody 1999 referendum on independence, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Paniai victims ’ families met such claims with fierce incredulity....,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
'I am tired. '
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
'I am afraid ', he says.
'I am afraid to be arrested by the military, I am afraid to be shot. '
His brother, Yacobus, repeated the view that the people of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai ’ s neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital, one person died, and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Married villagers protested in front of the company ’ s location office.
The police said that villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were in such panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly admitted here, says the TIME.
'I have hidden myself in my house for two days'.
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be called to account and for the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the discontent of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the leafy highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained under the pretext of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some never resurface.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here cultivate everything they eat: especially nota and fruits and vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women, who can each work four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between indigenous Papua and new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nabire airport.
The region ’ s few jobs typically go to better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to run its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of Paniai's Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting remain strained by international media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, even though they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch ’ s deputy director in Asia, Jokowi ’ s campaign ’ s promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shootings.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group's allegations and said to journalists in Jakarta: 'Indonesia still has a democratic system and there is a free media, making it difficult to hide the evidence of human rights cases'.
The people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua people say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobain says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he must repay.
"They do not need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai victims carried out a final symbolic act of comfort: the body of a victim was buried on a territory precisely opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
'What else can we do? '
The second time that Fire captures Dubai ’ s ‘ Torch ’ skyscraper.
On Friday, a fire found its way into one of the world ’ s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337 meter high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that, in just two years, sweeps through the tower, which, by chance, is called the Tower of Torch (torch).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and the cries of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "said a resident who named George Reuters.
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities have said that fire fighting units destroyed the fire and cooled the building around 4.00 p.m. local time (midnight GMT).
The government said it is working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used outside high-rise buildings around the world.
Research by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the lining, the exterior lining for decoration or insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that they believe that the system of panels to isolate and disguise the London Tower of Grenfell in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best of Five
The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for a Davis Cup individual to play on only two winning sets was barely supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-seat classic, which is often very long, but also very much appreciated for this reason, therefore remains the traditional one.
63.54% of the member states voted in favour of the reform, so ITF President David Hagproperty ’ s target was narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic contests, "said Hagproperty.
They will continue to work to improve their applications.
It was not until the vote, after many objections, that the proposal had already been made that the final should be held in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively small details: For example, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, training places etc. requirements will be made easier and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers board banned items, finds out a poll.
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20% deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6% who entered the aircraft, while inadvertently carrying banned knives or other items.
Less than 1% claimed that they had belatedly discovered that they had gone astray with guns, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers tend to disregard the rules.
Among the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7% of millennials were members of Generation X, compared to less than 15%.
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security checks, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also confirmed that they had landed deliberately banned drugs.
The company said it interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many inadvertently got smuggling through airport security and how many deliberately did it.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggled goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were the ones who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about what fluids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that most of the TSA ’ s confiscated items are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought that TSA could view books as smuggled goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders.
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
In doing so, he has failed to confirm that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever triumphalist figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time a different, less glamorous figure when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations of the new mass-market model 3.
Musk has often advertised over the past few months with more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Musk is now admitting that of a total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK $1000) "Reservation Deposit".
At the moment 455,000 such non-binding reservations were made, Musk admitted at a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the boss of Tesla does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument is that the challenge to ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but in production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 - all models taken together - will be 500,000, and by 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla is able to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
If there are major delays, however, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
In that case, the company will not be able to prevent unhappy customers from running away in droves.
CEPOL ’ s Pruitt Party withdraws because of the Obama Era ’ s delay in reducing emissions.
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency ’ s chief, rescinded his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of airborne pollutants that cause smog.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the case brought against his previous position in a Federal Employment Court.
It is a deadline that was set on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "meddling in local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma Public Prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly sought to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry resist.
Wednesday ’ s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Employment Court in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority by attempting to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his about-turn on ozone standards quite simply reinforces the EPO's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards in time.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others and, in an agreement, set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in its previous job.
"We do not believe in judicial regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority that we have. '
Nevertheless, CEPOL's opinion said that at some point Pruitt would 'use its' late seat power and all other legally available powers' to ensure that the rules' are based on sound policies and the best information available '.
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader revision of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of CEPOL - according to our complaints - is an important benefit to health and safety from these 6.7 million New York citizens and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneider said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems for vulnerable groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health officials and environmentalists applauded Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe in," Lori Ann Burd said from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen Celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, an invitation is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m. to a serenade.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth benefit shop can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village has been made a priority by the friends and patrons of Tumlingen.
Walter Martini stresses: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
According to the letter of the document, apart from the former parish church, there was also a stately court, to which the church or the patronage law belonged, and not the other way round.
People lived there.
As can be seen from the description of the town of Oberamtes Freudenstadt in 1858, next to the village of Unterdorf and the village of Oberdorf, which can still be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, stately settlement centre of the village.
Old maps dating back to around 1600 reinforce these historical realities.
The Patronat Law originated from the early medieval law of the church.
A gentleman who built, equipped and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.
This was connected with the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The largest of the two was destroyed at Christmas 1673.
The new bell sounded in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the bell cables stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops were stationed near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In the New Year's Eve of 1834 a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower movement, which still exists today, was preserved as a witness to the 750 year old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen Rentnern" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn cultivate the Hilarius plant.
On Sunday, July 16th, the Friends and Patrons of Tumlingens invite to the 6th Serenade at the old cemetery of the St. Hilarius Chapel.
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Head of the local authority Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 p.m.
At the end of the Serenade there is a turn-around in front of the graveyard.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers are hoping for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for both Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
Friends and patrons of Tumlingens are particularly committed to home care, as Serenaded organizer Walter Martini has confirmed.
Verein will check approval of wind turbines
"Boisheim weaves herself" does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim weaves itself" invited Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The club argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, no wind power plants could have been approved at all in Boisheimer Nette, since at that time, a wind power concentration zone existed in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent the "closure" of the landscape.
A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided, by amending the land-use plan, to establish a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - which had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf due to a form defect.
"Due to the absence of a pre-condition for planning, the approval issued is still unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim weaves herself".
Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: 'In this way, the granting of permission for the construction of wind power plants is excluded from planning law'.
The circle confirms receipt of the request.
"The relevant letters have been received by Viersen County since last week," a speaker said.
The circle is taking them to look into the matter again.
However, they are unlikely to stop the process.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the arguments of the association "Boisheim wept" on Thursday.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200-metre wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company in which the town of Viersen indirectly participates had already entered into lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households, which corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four homes.
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersen Stadtrat gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the county of Heinsberg.
Auto and Tractor Cracks Together: Women dies in terrible accident
A terrible road accident took place on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhine-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police data, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich, with her car, was accompanied by her mother, 53 years old, as an accompanying person, by the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and Commerce Planning 'Home Shoppers' weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will discover new shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The business association and the city council want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice the residents to go shopping in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shop" weekend is intended to sensitize customers to what offers their own city offers apart from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre will invite you to "midnight shopping".
The campaign is aimed not only at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
City administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce.
In this way, both the business association and the city will go into another stage of the project "Attractive downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Brunnenfest with a salesperson Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees on that day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be newly or re-opened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help to revive the city centre - up to landlords, businesses throughout the city and associations.
It is necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which has partly spread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, Head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will be taking part in the nationwide third "Heimat-Shoppen" day, for the first time.
Apart from Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day was supposed to 'promote value for local trade and enhance its importance for the common good of our cities', Streit wrote.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behavior can influence his or her direct environment.
Two deaths and several injuries following an explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people have been injured.
Two people were killed and nine others injured in a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, some of them serious.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) another injured person was in critical condition.
One person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A missing one was also recovered dead later.
The dead were school employees.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday, few people stayed in the building of the Minnehha Academy.
Trump pressured Mexico to pay the border wall after leaked transcripts of telephone calls.
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump, in a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, called for an end to public statements that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President reprimanded him for publicly denouncing the wall and reportedly said to him: 'You cannot tell the press.'
Trump began his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the US southern border, and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call to Australia ’ s Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that taking over refugees who emigrated to Australia from the US would be "ridiculous," mies, "and" stupid, "and that insisting on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a" Depp "after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore Ford Massacre: Activists reintroduce racist lynas a call for justice.
A 1942 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and jumped to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men emerged with guns to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield carefully.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man shouted.
'Get him out of the car! '
The screams broke the silence when a young black man was crushed by the front-passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, is only an afterthought.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience experienced very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm, George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It is truly inconceivable that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organise the settlement.
'It is a stain on a story, but it is a burden on our souls'.
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, imitation serves as a dramatic appeal to action, and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
'We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice '.
A forensic doctor lays a sheet of bed on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Order Lynch on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI records received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for lynching was always known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer primary campaign.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a battle - allegedly for a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that the baby she was wearing did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local criminal prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, which removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks formulated it even more concisely.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
'You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, that will happen to you here'.
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual replica of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their narrative is vivid, stirring, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It is difficult to see and even harder to look the other way, but Greene said that is the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
'But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or if you do not want to hear what I have gone through '.
The rehearsals for this year's production started in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - rushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not so," said Marbaugh.
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to go back to these times'.
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rasona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who shouts at Hester and urges him, furious that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
'I said n --- he, disappeared from my property! '
Rascona replies the fire.
There is a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out with laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
'What? 'asked Rascona.
It is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still kidding.
'I simply do not think that white people said 'n --- he' at the time. '
"But," one of the other black actors quipped.
'You only have to hit the hard 'R.'.
And this is where the energy in space shifts, a sense of comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rasona says the N word, he says it loud and clear.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are cries, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed with a sorrow stands above the actors' bodies and carries out Billie Holidays's grieving eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred metres behind it, a group of around four dozen spectators sift out of their eyes sweat and tears.
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white.
A couple has come from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are just down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia ’ s oppressive moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks takes them to the tomb of the Malcoms and Dorsey on a pilgrimage.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the lynx murders took place, the air is feeling ghostly.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse.
Children sit on their heads, record the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They are not really dead," a young boy mutates as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynchpiece and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then collapses in their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did so for one reason. '
Later, the audience meets the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta, excited to chat with a black couple they have just got to know, is chatting.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that have left the performance feeling.
"It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... come from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
'What really does with me makes me believe that the lynchpin is still going on 'she added,' today it is only called a police sleight '.
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks farm keeps at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he had already begun to plan the performance next year.
"Imitation is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"If we do not learn anything from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it. '
"Twilight of the Gods" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth.
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work, director Frank Castorf also focuses on a colourful staging in a gigantic six-story setting.
The rotating stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) features a shabby street corner with a Berlin wall and a Döner tree, a "Plaste and Elast" logo from GDR times and the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes classic car park in which the Rhine daughters pose as rockergirls or alternatively an Isetta.
Tied oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" production.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise as well as in the "Rheingold"., and.

Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully feverish Hagen surrounding the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he slammed Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
The festival takes place every hour from Foster, Milling, Vinke and Conductor Janowski, who is humble and has his hands tied to the note diamond.
There is a great deal of applause for the Festival Orchestra, which is performing on stage for the first time - again in casual casual fashion in the face of the heat.
The show was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his directing team.
If he had to go on a running pipe concert in 2013, there was great jubilation five years later, with the sporadic "Buh" round going under.
Head of the Festival Katharina Wagner was very pleased about this.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the" ring "in a way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it was also able to understand his view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Volunteers
They work in several places during their voluntary year.
Where else?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have been working at school in the open whole day.
What are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, young people, refugees, young adults.
They are now 26 years, a late volunteer.
Why?
Quantity: I have done a Abitur.
And then, let us say, a degree in civil engineering successfully ended.
I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered what you are doing.
Take a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how things really are on the ground, perhaps at the centre.
And was it?
Lots: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social field in the winter semester.
I am going to study dual, I am probably doing a social worker training at the youth office in Herne and I am studying in Hamm at the university of applied sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of work during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where to do your FSJ.
It can be done from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied in my case.
I was also part of the OGS, that is to say, in the afternoon care.
For me, this was exactly the right thing to do, and it...
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works..
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Well, this is not about calculating stats.
We always have other people on our heads who each have a different story behind them.
Whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of contact?
Quantity: I am not the type for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of friendliness...........
There are sometimes negative moments, but so is life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive business.
The UK ’ s Pearson education group said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72%, as another restructuring program was launched to overcome the pressure facing the company.
The job cuts that General Director John Fallon largely announced for late 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost-cutting program a cost reduction plan of another £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged, having increased from 1% to £2.05 billion in the first six months.
Kabul's convoi attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing.
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, announced a statement by NATO.
Unexpected local reports suggest that three civilians died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement states that the explosion on Thursday evening had taken place when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was' attacked 'by an improvised explosive device carried by people.
The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest military attack since the US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is weighing up increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
CEPOL reverses the decision to delay the smog rule after complaints
The US Environmental Protection Agency has reversed a decision to delay Obama ’ s administration regulation, which requires governments to reduce emissions that cause smog a day after 15 countries sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push forward the so-called 'ozone regulations 2015' and said it was showing the Agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced EPA ’ s intention to delay by a year until October 2018 the ozone regime – which will measure pollutant emissions in one part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to roll back a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump claims will boost economic growth.
The efforts have, however, triggered a setback for democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that breathing in air containing ozone can "reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Community Council
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common area in the future residence of the elderly.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the missing plot is signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take some time for the area previously owned by the parish to be in the public domain, there is no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be undertaken by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council would like to see such a common area not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the senior-oriented residential area, but open to the community.
As an example, the word "knitting café" was used.
The decision that was already made last autumn by allocating funds to the current budget will be sweetened by means of funding.
The building is located in the redevelopment area.
According to Tjaden, the creation of a Community area would be eligible for funding at 60% of 30%.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a spanner between their legs in this respect, provides for the statement that both the saddle - which is similar to the surrounding constructions - and the roof of the pull - which reduces the height of the grapes and makes the construction more economic - would be possible.
Not only does Wilfried Sohmer say that this addition is unnecessary.
If it helps: unanimity it passes the board.
The Community area is not so simple.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings that we do not really make progress with, and in the common area, we are now rejecting the idea, she says, 'I am struggling with it'.
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against local participation.
It sees a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because the purchase of the area does not give a subsidy, but rather gives a real value that can be marketed if in doubt, is the counter-argument.
Staher's request to split the proposal for a decision accordingly finds three supporters.
This leaves us with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller sums up as follows: 'If we take the decision in this way, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure'.
Car collision: Cyclists Traded on the Road
On Wednesday, when crossing the road, an 82 year old cyclist was captured by a car in Garath and seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year old Langenfelder had been cycling on the bike path of the Schwarzer Weg road from Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the Am Buchholzer Busch road.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder took to the road, he didn't seem to care about the other traffic.
He came together with a car that was run by a 66-year-old Hilden.
The man was thrown onto the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern München has to give up David Alaba and Thiago in the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund.
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to suck the match against Dortmund.
With personnel concerns, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven pros miss the title defender in the Supercup against the trophy winner.
Die Personalsorge beim deutschen Fußball-Rekortmeister Bayern München werden vor dem Supercup am Samstag (20.30 Uhr / ZDF und Eurosport) bei Pokalwinner Borussia Dortmund immer größer.
In the duel with the BVB coach coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to renounce David Alaba.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
Also missing are Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the last six games, Ancelotti blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Marcelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
This was not good last time. '
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently, "said Marcelotti, who expects a" difficult, intensive game ".
The duel between the two German football mods captivates the fans.
The match was sold out with 81.360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hike from Star to Star in the Har
In the Harz the first "star path" is to be established nationwide.
This is what the association Sternwarte Sankt Andresberg is planning.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" responds to the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up blackboards along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-accessible installations in five to six places" in Oberharz.
Infrage would come from St. Andresberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels should be added via the Internet.
This is why a good mobile network reception is important when selecting a location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path is to be extended by train.
"On the star trail the viewer will learn a lot worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
Moreover, they learned why stars have different colors, or why one star was brighter than another, though it was much further away.
It is also explained which constellation a selected star is in and when it is best seen.
The association has operated the highest located observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andrew.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen with the naked eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Sternenwerg - the Planetenweg.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetenweg with its stells leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extra-terrestrial" location in Diemarden (Municipality Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stells with the individual planets - including Pluto at the end of the dwarf planet - are set exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimetres.
The total distance of the planet path is about four kilometres.
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasil Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unpounding World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super Liberty Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five bottom list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said: "How do you, champion?
I wish you good luck. '
Lomachenko defended his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko Manager Egis Klimt noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect magnitude".
"I am a former spring weight," Garcia recalled.
"I went for bronzes [to 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I am small for 140.
I would like to come down to light weight.
And he must move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That is what fans demand.
Let us give them that. '
Lomachenko agreed.
'Boxing needs this fight '.
Climate asked if it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree next summer with Garcia a date (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight match in the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it," said Garcia, and later expressed an open mind to fight in the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... '
Garcia said that he rated Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped in the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the three-fight champion from Riverside look "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-off".
Garcia said the focus is to show punch strength, then boxing.
Both said that they could feel the momentum built for their own struggle.
"This is the battle that must be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on this, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I have been waiting for the top fighters, and that is Mikey.
It will be a great battle. '
Four Wounded after Tyre Place
In the event of an accident on the A7, some four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. shortly before the opening point on the market width, presumably after a tyre.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it flooded and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were injured in the accident.
During the initial rescue service for the injured, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, followed by traffic on the left lane passing the accident site.
Fortuna Hoffmann: 'Triumphs works better'
After 2: 2 on the start of the season against Braunschweig, Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defence formation will score points in Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game, and the result would not have been the opposite for 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two opposite goals too much, and we need to be even more careful in Aue," says the defence player from Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains, the trike chain should also be further optimized.
And a gate after a push does not want to catch up.
'For the future, it will be the case that no one is standing next to Michael (Rensing). '
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also be able to cope better with the experience of preparing the triangles than with the quads.
"I still do not know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players who can build well in the triangles of the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann," said Hoffmann.
'Prerequisite, but that we harmonise even better and that we do not afford so many playing errors in the set-up '.
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw does not know.
The achievement may well be okay, "said Hoffmann.
'But if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season. '
His coach did not want to know about this.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the Sachsen match in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a bad weather.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, who believe that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a favourite of the ascent in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are at the moment," says the interior defender of Fortuna.
It is true that the guests from the Rhineland are the lighter favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we throw them away just because we have the right to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance sheet is quite positive in only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat in advance," explains Fortuna's Chief Coach.
'To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant '.
And so Funkel doesn ’ t want to see his players on Sunday.
New Results of Sweden ’ s Asylum Age Review Test
Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of those tested are over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the testing last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are supposed to make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Code) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, migration net has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were considered 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is' possibly under 18 years old '.
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months.
"We see no great difference in statistics of recent months, the numbers are quite constant," he said to the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases' suggesting that the person being investigated was 18 years or older '.
When the Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are taken, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in a number of areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether they passed through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say it for sure, we should not act as if we could, "he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case this is about 10%. '
Fully in Plan
Work on the three bridges of the country road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very well in time, it is running super", says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the government's headquarters in Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation.
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted arched bridge covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4,80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years.
In order to ensure durability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve metres long, respectively 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance to the village of Lauterbach has now received a so-called bridge cap of 1.30 metres in width and 7 tonnes in the north on Wednesday morning.
This is a side attachment, which is also used as an operating way.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 m wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path is to be followed.
The special thing is that they are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with patented bridge caps.
The laying of lines through the Lauterbach building required a special touch of sensitivity.
There is also a fibre optic cable that many companies are connected to.
The people living in the vicinity were informed of the project by hand in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs first had to be fished.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collective wine in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated in a single lane by an traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German Potato Salat
It is not so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Volcanic Eifel district (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance, which displays a peaceful flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolstein Stadthalle Rondell invites to the "big campaign start" poster.
And well-known names – like Alice Weidel, who, together with Alexander Gauland, is the leading duo for the federal election on September 24, and Vice-Chair Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on the spot hours before the event begins do not want to listen to the AfD people, but want to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally planned as "All at a Table" on the Brunnenplatz, the town picnic will take place in the car park below the Rondell - right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
This is a colourful picture.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the One World Forum and one of the relevant organizers, is really happy about: "Great how many people have come together here".
There is music and a lot of food, including a "Urdeutscher Potatosalat, which the AfD could eat without any problems", says the woman who brought him along.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, and they have a presence at the station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Volcanic Eifel reported that he had made an effort to organise such an event and had been awarded the prize.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but got a cancellation there, because due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
With a view to the event on Rondellvorplatz he says: "This is the right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful".
This is also the case: around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on Rondellvorplatz, and a number of speakers, including the Rhine-Palatinate chairman Uwe Junge, are taking part in the city hall.
There are about 200 people in the Chamber waiting for the leading candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the Vice-Chair, Beatrix von Storch, to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but there is also a good time to clean up shortly after 9 pm.
The police can move away - no special events.
Trompete Strikes Tromp
Listen to the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest" or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and prize-winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is the Solotrompeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the solo soloist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach sings in a new dress, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" is combined with Bulgarian folklore, and in the play "Exchange Suite" by Jazz echo-carrier Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free playing mix to form a fascinating total artwork.
This core piece of the programme was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try it out, "said Kristen Stewart quite openly about her bisexuality.
'Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think: 'Oh that was cool, what comes next?'
The most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately fell apart bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I had played it? '
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So I have never been confused or obstructed.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously. '
She suffered particularly from this, according to "Bang Showbiz", but during school time, when she preferred to dress like a Bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very much.
When I eleven, the children told me I would look like a buck.
I felt really attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think: 'Girls, be proud of you!'
Especially to the public they don't like to explain their love life: "People expect you to be relative in some way and that annoys me.
And some may call me thankless, but I do not like having to justify myself to the public at large. '
West Virginia Governor announces that he is changing the party.
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced at a rally with President Trump on Thursday evening that he would change the party.
Like it or not, the democrats have moved away from me, "said Governor Justice.
'Today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I will tell you that I cannot help you any more if I am a democratic governor. '
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
'As a trainer, I would say that it is time to play another game '.
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes noted that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday evening saying: 'The change of Governor Justice's party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again'.
"With only 15 governors and control of the least legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is headed from top to bottom and unable to find a positive unifying message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, the world leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to get back into sport.
Russia ’ s athletics leader, Dmitry Shylakhtin, said during the IAAF Congress, on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country ’ s ban on sport was correct and that he was determined to combat doping.
He said he was sorry for 'all the athletes who were caught in gold and silver medals in competitions'.
Despite his comments, the IAEA Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
'The Council as a whole and the Congress as a whole were pleased that the Russian Federation itself has realised that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is recast '.
Coe said he was also 'pleased' about Russia accepting the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but the Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the time to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been to separate clean athletes from the rotten system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which will begin on Friday in London, in accordance with the strict IAAF criteria.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia still has some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate, and banned trainers are still free, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Sad Soldiers in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar in North Hessen, some 1000 people of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali thought.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city with high security precautions.
On the still unexplained crash, Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two pilots who had died as "experts of their profession".
"We salute the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Staghauptmann from North Hesse had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday they were brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter with a dead guard of the Bundeswehr.
At noon, only the members of the church left.
After that, the funeral began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the German armed forces and politicians.
Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the German Army Volker Wieker were among them.
Sad branches laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
The Secretary of Defense of the Leyen described the soldiers who had died as "highly decorated" and experienced in use.
The Staghauptmann was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots in his regiment.
Volker Bauersach, the commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also said: 'If this occupation could not prevent the crash, then no one could have done so'.
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Leyen Minister: the deployment was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance 'for a country from which we are only separated by two states,' she said.
After the funeral the coffins were brought from the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information on this..,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried beside his wife after his death.
The House of Kings announced this on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband ’ s decision, the statement continued.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of not being happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ’ s ascended to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to be king.
In 2016, he retired and earned the title of Prince ’ s Palace.
Because Henrik was not given the title and the role that he wanted, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokesman of the Danish Royal House, explained.
Where the last place of rest for the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
He does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe met in London in 1965.
On the Thames he worked in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, Prince Henrik had a difficult reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia-tabak, who had a reputation in Germany as a socially critical intellectual, I could not hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
These were two mistakes! '
Prime Minister Weil Wants Rapid re-election
The CDU and the FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
After losing the red-green majority of the government, Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in Lower Saxony is in favour of a rapid re-election of the Bundestag, but he does not want to resign.
Because, on Friday, it was in favour of Parliament being dissolved.
Previously, a surprise member of the Green Party ’ s party in Lower Saxony had thrown Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s government into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the presidential election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition.
Former Green MEP Elke Twests justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency of Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hanover.
Chairman of the CDU, Björn Thümler, wishes to recommend to his group that they be included.
The combined CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in Lower Saxony ’ s Landtag, SPD, and Green 68.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the Landtag decide to dissolve itself as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility of the parliament removing trust from the prime minister and choosing a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These opportunities must be properly assessed in law, "said Thümler.
'All questions will be discussed calmly if they are legally reasonable. '
Thümler called Twental's step "yet something strange".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good '.
She referred to herself as a Black Green supporter.
The Greens called on the resignant Members to return their Landtag mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will immediately return her country parliament mandate, which she received via the green country list," said the regional presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance, Anja Piel, said: 'We very much regret the decision taken by Elke Twens'.
She has deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group.
'Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content, we cannot follow this step '.
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twests to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of the Red Green," the German Social Democrats chief wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s decision to have Landtag quickly reelected.
In Lower Saxony, the “Rot-Grün ” exit costs the majority.
The politician "in her wounded vanity and frustration, her personal interests before the good of the country," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony is joining in this dirty game of intrigues and is trying to make political capital out of it".
Lower Saxony's CDU leader, Björn Thümler, wants to recommend to his deputies that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU.
Thomas Oppermann, the SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag, accused Twesten of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 presidential election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was strongest before the SPD, but the SPD and Greens had a razor-thin majority of one vote in parliament.
Agriculture Minister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and answering in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebenswarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the egg batches involved.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, there is practically no risk to health.
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis response - all the eggs are out of supply - because the central role of the investigator is not really being played by the Federal Agriculture Minister?
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my House immediately took a stand and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known that Germany was affected.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe to transport.
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg in eggs is exceeded, these are not transportable.
However, unpaved eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it is not the companies that are to blame.
Are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat?
The current state of knowledge does not directly blame production companies.
Instead, they face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in case of an emergency.
Is it simply a lack of staff or consistent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% ruled out.
It is precisely for this reason that it is crucial that such events be investigated consistently and that they be handed over to the public prosecutors in cases where offences can be committed.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide full information.
Is regular alarm in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The counterfeit product has put manufacturers, dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be made clear that the illegal use of fipronil as an insecticide is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with great pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to provide prompt and full information on the situation.
How Football ’ s Financial Rules affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing European football clubs from spending freely will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris, Saint Germain.
Some consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, created by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without much loss.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ($262 million) to buy out the Brazilian from its treaty, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make money easier for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but they have to deal with legitimate sources of revenue to enable them to take the break-even point in their Soccer related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their quest for success would effectively cheat and risk ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a tougher business.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can incur losses of €30 million.
And, while Platini fell from grace in 2015 from the presidency, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to discouraging excessive spending.
"To be sure, FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid for the Neymar buy-out clause in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer amount of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years can be recorded in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of €60 million ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outstrip their financial regulators by inflating their revenue from companies associated with club owners.
While a Qatar firm could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not regard this as a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made by the organizing committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar denied in 2022 that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors, and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG on Neymar's transfer, told the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the PSG.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16, with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising, and tricot sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports club, shares La League ’ s reservations about a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"Once a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play, because you can choose different paths or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country. '
Swiss in Search of a New Cognitive Tiger
In the past years, Chocolat Frey has made Bord-chocolate for Swiss.
Now sweet cooperation is coming to a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
Some 17 million small, red-white packed shock absorbers of 14 grams per year distribute the cabin crew to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide information on the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to be 1.5 to 2 million Swiss Francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual sales of about one billion Swiss francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer.
The Swiss do not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey is seeking to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Since 2006, Swiss has been distributing chocolate panels on board its flights.
Prior to signing a contract with Migros ’ daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, delivered the chocolate tablets.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoilt with delicacies from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class wet passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey also distributes on the short distance, both in Business and Economy Class.
Athletics - Diskus-Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches the World Cup Final
The three-time World Champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother, Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, had failed in the national World Cup final and could only watch the discus contest from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt, Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters wide, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia in Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 1990s Grunge era (when the mastermind David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artefact, it is both a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talkative can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By focusing on the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they still managed to get back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more along the watering can principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 1990s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That the Cradle").
At one point, a character crawls through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The likeable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now the novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underbelly from Singles, whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
These are the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I assume to be his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", the last scene of which will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, indicates to be a TV series found: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters - a hard-eyed Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon Levitt.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But Comrade Detective is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited for a smaller length, could better deliver its agitprop condition, since Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything into a feast.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we are doing it even with our own recent history and with theirs.
Striking the Drug Mafia
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest District, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday.
Fifteen defendants between 25 and 77 years of age were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued.
Officials also provided large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects in Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were on duty.
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor ’ s office has been investigating Constance against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo, and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
That is why, on Wednesday morning, four officials from Palermo were also involved.
The investigation was aimed mainly at Italian nationals closely related to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to be due to the gang.
Complaints of major gaps in the foreign register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the German register for foreigners has significant shortcomings.
This leads partly to serious errors in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's representative for refugee management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "partly serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and expulsions, warned in an analysis that is available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the data, 10 million people with foreign nationality are included in the register, including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been maintained sufficiently, the data quality in parts has not been good.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "by people who have long since ceased to be alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register".
"Flawed data input can significantly slow return processes," the report goes on to say.
Moreover, statistics on people who have to leave include EU citizens who do not have to leave.
However, such incorrect allocations' resulted in a distorted debate on how to deal with people who are obliged to leave the country ', according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government seems to have begun sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy when they arrived from there.
According to an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" reports.
The paper thus states that the BAMF will carry out such procedures' with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - back to Italy since 1 June 2017 '.
Since the end of 2014, it has been virtually impossible to do so, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state that they first reach.
When a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
As a justification, the office now writes: 'In the meantime, the absorption capacity for families with underage children has increased substantially in Italy'.
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The left-wing spokesperson in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: 'Families with children are threatened with illegal reception conditions and a threat to the welfare of children because of the shortcomings of the Italian asylum system'.
Achieved Second Best
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach has already been provided by the blood donor service for other people.
At least of the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all Jürgen Greule, who with his 100 donations now shared 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, the community recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood at the council meeting.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for it, and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, not to mention unselfish," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned food is broken down into its components.
So three people could benefit from blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported about the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the head of the DRK Regional Support Board.
Obviously, the change to the theatre house led to higher attendance a few years ago.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and received 50 donations each.
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger account for half as many, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter account for ten times each 500 millilitres of their vital contributions.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of intensifying pressure.
Policymakers in the Bank ’ s Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members this month seeking an increase as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth projections to 1.7% for 2017 and 1.6% for 2018, warning that fiscal pressure would continue, with inflation expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the next few years to rein in the inflation fueled by Brexit, and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to allocate cheaper funding to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this scheme - £115 billion.
minutes after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, GDP remains weak in the short run, as pressure on households' real incomes continues to weigh consumption."
At interest rates, she repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and "a little larger" level than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
The Bank ’ s downward revision of growth forecasts for this year and next year is relative to the 1.9% and 1.7% projected in May.
It has kept its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31, falling by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision will not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an increase in interest rates, and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to reach 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the Bank by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal salary increases, because the tightening will first get worse before it improves.
It added that monetary policy will not "prevent" the decline in income over the next few years, but it added that wages will "recover significantly" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will offset some of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25% last August, following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully achieve prices and the economy.
Before the Bank ’ s last ruling on interest rates, there had been a call for an increase in interest rates, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell last month, from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and that it would attract again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its 2% target was' entirely 'to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "With the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders are clamoring for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who end the existing deals and take out the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more popular. '
NHS (The National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people.
Patients will have access to "transformational" HIV prevention treatment from September, following a battle before the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-sex pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) that can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86% is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as "an important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced across England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register to participate in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, recorded, and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and surpass the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges. '
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. '
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and for no one at risk of HIV to be left behind.
Now that PrEP testing has been obtained, we are on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. '
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: 'The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformational this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention, and how it can stop transmission of this life-threatening infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us move a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society '.
Living Big Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that I was living with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. '
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi ’ s architecture and design studio, Duck & Shed, from Notting Hill, to use the 12,5-foot ceilings to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they had to be stacked on top of each other without us having to bite.
It was not just a question of building a simple platform, but of creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the top or bottom function. '
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms on top of one another in full - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classical copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
Using mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space, and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.
The mirror in the kitchen feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering has gone into this", explains Erfan of the MDF door, reinforced with steel.
'It is balanced, so that it glides very easily when you push the door up '.
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
'In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the land '.
Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. '
It shows that by good design and increased number of square meters, an apartment can be transformed from something standard into something quite.
Indeed, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers Battle for a $500 million real-estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in a dispute over one of Victorias ’ s largest real-estate empires worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul has sought to leave the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 homes worth more than $1 billion, accumulated since the family bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis ’ portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
After an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third.
One court case states that this means that Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul has $176 million worth of assets.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul..
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed conciliations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business – something that Colin, Paul claims, ruled out.
Colin argues that this is not true; instead, he accuses Paul of mismanaging some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the main priority," he wrote.
Costs rise in this case, with hundreds of pages of advocacy, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer, and leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he "was high school in my last years, when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lusis group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Lukas and Mark were, Paul says, "embittered about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin was very reluctant, even though he was a former AFL board member and, after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, was the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say 'I really cannot say much' because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and take our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother ’ s demands.
"Our father did not want Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution".
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
'Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future ', Colin wrote.
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do so.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in the hope of keeping the boss on a more consistent course.
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met senior executives on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that gets into the president ’ s hands.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he had good information. "
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was annoyed by unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions to be persuaded," said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control is, according to six former campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption is always valued."
Fine.
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know others - that without their interventions, Trump ’ s tweets would have provided even more fuel.
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If his staff have managed to keep trouble away from him several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has been consistent in preventing Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties repeatedly try to advance their own agenda by presenting material to Trump that might advance their views of the world.
Politically - very concerned with this story - reported in May about the consultants' preference to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuttings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is determined to find out where they come from.
This was precisely what happened at the end of February, when someone mischievous the president with a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief chief chief, Katie Walsh, of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or offered no concrete evidence, or that he made false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a priest ’ s more effective manager, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still seek influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol.
Since the address is unknown, the public will be asked for and hoped for help.
Police throughout Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are not by their nature known, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday about the action following the EU Most Wanted Advent calendar from winter.
Experience would have shown that many refugees from holiday destinations are hiding, it was said, from Europol.
21 postcards have been created for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been available, more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online applications have so far been arrested, at least eleven of them on the basis of indications following the publication on the website.
Passengers negotiate a rift and return to the 'millionaires' series.
Some of the wealthiest property owners in the West Midlands are once again at war with some determined travelers who negotiated a reclamation drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their manor houses.,,, and.,,,,,,,,,,,
Travellers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy Solihull street called the "Millionars series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters with them only after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch dug by the Council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents urged the Council of Solihull, who said that it was' useless to deal with the problem '.
An anonymous resident said: "They went there on Monday night after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones onto the passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably more today. '
She added: "The council of Birmingham knows how to deal with this by giving long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on the Street Brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it. '
A local who did not want to be mentioned said: 'It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area. '
A spokeswoman from the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the land beyond Streetbrook Road and we are working with the police of Solihull, and we are taking the necessary legal steps to move it forward as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the Court will have to examine when we submit our case. '
Waldhotel Luise from Birkenhof
The Waldhotel Luise is transformed from the former Hotel Birkenhof.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is due to be reopened on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH as of 13 April 2014, some 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time and income from the spa tax.
In the fall of 2014, the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation to the Board of Directors, with dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county, which generated controversial debate.
The city prevented asylum seekers from staying by drawing up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the local council.
But above all, the Freudenstädter Lord Mayor Julian Oswald defended the hotel location and talked back then about serious people interested in the hotel.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels Group, headed by Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, bought the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it into a three-star plus hotel under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
Building rubble containers have been standing in front of the entrance at the former Hotel Birkenhof for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were torn out, blankets were partially dismantled and old baths removed from the rooms.
The entire building is a single construction site.
Much remains to be done by March.
"It is actually a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
'We want to make a jewel on it '.
Facilities include a swimming pool, spa area and a meeting room.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, wants to set itself up broadly, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups and business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Oswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas are identical to those of the hotel.
'We are on the same line '.
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise.
Less than a million euros, he expects.
The external installations are also being brought to a head, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace is created in an inner courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt ist ein gute Markt".
Russia Affair: US Special Counsel Uses Grand Jury
In the Russia affair with US President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reported to have appointed a Grand Jury.
The panel has begun its work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper viewed the move as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that the panel has already begun subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
For some time now, US intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men campaigning as Republican advisers.
Mueller reportedly also looked more and more at Trump ’ s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Counsel, Trump, had put the spotlight on himself and investigated whether the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine available evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to indict.
Grand juries are therefore also called indictments.
In most cases, they are switched on when there are major and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The board can also be called on by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to be interrogated under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer have already been issued.
The report says that people who took part in the meeting were asked to make a statement.
They should also provide documents.
Alongside Trump, Jr., Trump ’ s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his then campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, were also on the conversation.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the investiture shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be involved at the end of the proceedings in order to decide on..,,,,,, and..
Still, the establishment of the panel marks the start of a new phase of investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russia ’ s story is a total invention, ” Trump said.
The issue gives democrats a chance to 'feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about'.
His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he knew nothing about the appointment of a Grand Jury.
However, this work is usually done in secret, he emphasized.
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Investigator in a 'fair' way.
Former FBI Director James Comey said three times that the president was not being investigated.
There is no reason to believe that this has changed, the statement continued.
But Mueller had been deployed only after Trump fired Comey.
Trump had been accused of obstructing justice because of this charge.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the Special Counsel and his staff.
That sparked speculation about Trump ’ s intention to dismiss Mueller....,.........
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Counsel, such as the Watergate affair involving later resigning President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the president ’ s request.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
On Thursday, two groups of Republican and Democratic senators proposed legislation that would make it impossible to dismiss the Special Investigator.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg Drive in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of just seven times the size of Berlin has disappeared from the shelf.
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research announced this on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing more than one trillion tonnes and measuring 5800 square kilometres, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years to be melted.
It is one of the largest ice giants recorded by researchers over the past three decades, with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres.
He does not pose a threat to people.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, for about 30 years, there has been a series of unusual icecaps collapsing in the region, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSICC) in a fact-based background.
Many researchers believe that this could be linked to global warming.
The now aborted colossus was part of the Larsen-C Shelf.
Shelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C Shelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf, the balance of growth and demolition was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete horseshoe has broken down there, writes AWI-Orscher Daniela Jansen.
There are some arguments in favour of the Larsen C-Shelf being in danger, as the front edge has never been as far removed as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and may collapse if a piece is broken at a key point.
Melting ice and ice does not raise sea levels, because they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it does after melting.
However, the loss of the ice sheet means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This may raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the UK ’ s Antarctic Research Project (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C shelf is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica, covering nearly 50 000 square kilometres.
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is natural and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the longest retreat since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C-Shelf will grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: 'Our models say it will be less stable'.
But it will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a great many ice sheets of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades.
This long stretch of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the fastest rising temperature areas.
The CDU ’ s Personal Tariff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding leaving the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the county council passed 41 new posts in administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have completed their first working day.
The training places in the circle are obviously very much in demand.
Some 620 applications were made for the seats to be awarded this year.
However, there is still a lack of staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present there are still 50 vacant positions in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces.
The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, now wants to take the initiative in the district parliament to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the parties' wishes, the administration shall "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term professional needs, but also to counteract the shortage of candidates in the future, it is said.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, identify concrete measures for cross entry and include a training offensive, call for the CDU, the FDP and the UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
The circle is concerned with personnel problems that were previously unknown.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real 'competition between public employers'.
In addition, a large number of employees leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to act so that more jobs do not remain vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a nasty surprise at the district meeting when he publicly questioned the cap on personnel costs and confounded the rest of the parties...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People want to see every possibility of leaving the local employers' association reviewed.
"If we do not reach a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - should aim for a tariff of domestic use," states peoples.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the fare rules for the public service actually provide.
Wages are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level, based on professional years.
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on prostitution protection.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, the Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy Steps Up to NGO Migrant Boots
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue doing so unless they comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet', because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian public prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
'We can only assess all the accusations that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation '.
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Save', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take on rubber boat migrants, who will be delivered directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting supposedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which is monitoring rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the code of conduct, vessels such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not entail "significant changes or obstacles" to their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libya ’ s coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rise and Trials
Nine Weiler bikers, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the north Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Castle and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deiesheim.
There were observation points, some of them on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the vantage point reached a vantage point, connected by "floating" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days a lot of height meters were required.
Caverns, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and inns provided welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhale brine that is healing in the open-air inhalatorium.
New city has also been launched.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had come to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side, both sporting and cultural.
Konsole statt Rasen - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sport
Are sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of getting swelled in the wind and weather to fight over the stadium lawns?,,, and., and.
The fact is that e-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with large crowds.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga players, who are increasingly involved in this area.
In 2015, VfL Wolfsburg made the start, later FC Schalke 04 followed and, most recently, VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "many clubs are still climbing this train".
Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup is organizing the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where players from different clubs compete.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds in particular, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent E-athletes under contract, one could be present on these markets more often online than sending the Bundesliga to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is this about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or even the FIFA football simulation are played at the competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sport, leagues have become established in which the pros compete against each other.
And in the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it really a sport?
For many, the idea certainly needs to get used to.
Ingo Froevil, too, has been working on this issue for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport, because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which are also found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid response.
Professional gamers should train not only at the console, but also their bodies and take care of nutrition.
'The fit player is a good player '.
Froevil also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to implement in online games, and the structures of classical sport were lacking in the scene.
On a positive note, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are on the international road, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sport.
In 2016, Germany had implemented €50 million, mainly through advertising, sponsorship, and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
That is little against the nearly €2.4 billion of the federal football league.
However, e-sports is "not far away from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey", writes the Deloitte consultants.
Many countries are already on the international track.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in the eSports betting company Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froevil.
In the Netherlands and in France, football clubs are now obliged, according to Dutt, to set up an e-sports department.
"Compared to Europe, Germany is lagging behind," explains Röttgermann, Managing Director of VfB.
It is no longer enough to indulge in nostalgia, and to hide behind the old days.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but also to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
'You cannot hold fast to the fact that only in football will everything remain as it always was'.
Poison Eggs - The Egg Alternatives to Cooking and Baking
The toxic egg scandal now affects almost all of the federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and took all the eggs from the sale across Germany.
Only eggs that have not been shown to contain a fipronil should be taken on the shelves.
Michelle Carter is convicted of the texts pushing Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for having encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide through text and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months condemning them behind bars and five years suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the reckless killing of Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: 'My family is unconsolation.
My son was my best friend. '
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that she and Mr Roy suffered mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and eyes facing down when she was condemned.
"Conrad Roy killed her actions," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility, "she said.
'It has shown no remorse '.
But Carter's lawyer said it was' a terrible circumstance that she deeply regrets'.
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that their "age or maturity, or even mental illness, have a significant influence on their actions".
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that "there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything, and I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pains that we will with us, ".
Roy's sister, Cambyn Roy, said that she was "pursued" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"Not having this only person I have been with every day since I was born is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump from a building, create yourself, I do not know there are many ways," she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: 'You have to do it, Conrad' and 'All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy'.
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she benefit from the case through any press.
The case shared legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murdering her British fellow Italian citizen before being acquitted two years ago.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: 'Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison'.
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the FC Bayern ’ s new Mini-Lahm
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain of the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern has a big season for the winner of the Confed-Cup - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something else was different on his seat in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even if the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since there was no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer to be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, he kept his grip on his arm.
"The coach did not announce it," the Confedered-Cup winner said afterwards, after his first assignment as a Bavarian captain.
Very well, the harmony could have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also interpret Kimmich that way.
It was not the eight-year old Arturo Vidal who was chosen as the lead in the C-Elf, made up of youth players, debutants and professionals who have just come out of their holidays, but instead he.
Sugar is, of course, best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot, who you want to keep happy.
Those who have been chosen to take on the heritage of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old roamed the field as a mini lame.
Right behind, this is now his position, the white cord on the arm did the rest.
And Kimmich acted like the one who is best placed to take control of the helm.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unjoined force.
He had a look at the whole, while many others were concerned with himself.
Vidal missed out on his lack of fitness; Renato Sanches got stuck with the performance of the Asian journey (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle didn't seem negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey.
That worked very well after all.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereign.
The most notable of these were the Napoleonic Wars, which often proved difficult, and Süle also tried to build a few successful games.
His colleague, Mr Rudy, admitted that the result was' not as we hoped it would be '.'.,,,,,,,,,,,,
But he also performed well during the debut.
Relocation, Tempowechsel: "For this style I was also brought up".
After the match, you saw how unusual this Bavarian world is for the newcomers.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven.
Kimmich, after a few stingy statements, left his new fellow players behind.
There he heard from Süle an interesting sentence: "What is going on here I have already noticed.
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game ".
After all, he no longer needs to teach the new.
Alaba Motives ÖFB Ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ladies.
Austria ’ s most famous football player came up on Twitter shortly before the match and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian Legionnaire is a kind of club mate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and febert with our Ladys.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champion League winner should be a special injection of motivation.
Our ladies may well need the famous Bavarian Duke.
Business Satisfied with the Rhineland Palatinate Minister: Economics lauds Wissing the Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.,,,,, and.
This is evident after more than a year when the new Economics Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at T V ’ s request – and at the same time decry the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the association Trierer Unternehmen (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure, with construction law set to stand by 2021.
The western border of Trier, which is in the prime need of the Federal Road Map, also plays a role in the country's plans.
The aim is to get the route up and running in December 2020, says Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competitive companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, is seeking a Rhineland Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master coach as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A bonus of EUR 1 000 for the completed master examination and EUR 2 500 for graduates to become self-employed within ten years of the master's training.
The list of house charges for the country, however, remains long.
According to Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier, the country is also lacking the necessary personnel in the planned road construction process.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to set up mobility in Wissing, only 29 positions have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Balddorf, a member of the CDU Group, points to the Court of Auditors ’ calculations that the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in national roads in 2017 and 2018 than was proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also sobering that broadband has so far been developed in the country.
In 2016, regional companies rated network supply only at 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They are complaining about internet connections and interruptions.
On the other hand, former Minister for Economic Affairs, Eveline Lemke, is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the Pro Wind wind farm.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where, after four months of disagreements, she had already cleared the field again.
Audi is set to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash.
One day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than restrictions on driving", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the operations as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with the rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installations to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which has been able to use what are known as ‘ shut-off ’ devices, which have been able to regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested but has fallen in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees of Volkswagen have been indicted, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi ’ s engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacchero Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the Audi authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
Audi ’ s inclusion in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profits.
This is the message of Saturday ’ s raft on the Isar.
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that Isar visitors can also join us, there will be a raft going through Munich tomorrow Saturday with a special message.
Anyone who pulls the river Isar again on Saturday will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbach Bridge.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large transparency.
It shows a mountain of waste.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is..." the understanding of Isar as a wild river worthy of protection should be sharpened.
Last summer the raft passed over the river Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo ’ s Knollline noses and Laughter Against Suffering
He was born in Rimini, Italy.
Even with 85, the Argentinean still draws and works on a film.
His message: 'Laughter, because there is too much suffering in the world'.
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his first years as an artist, he was among others a pioneer of greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said.
After working in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, roundish mordillo figures can be drawn with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he is still sitting at the sign table today, working almost ten hours a day.
With calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, cuddly animals and watches, his drolly figures continue to spread worldwide.
He has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousandth foot as an opponent.
His figures speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is due to be released on the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he prefers the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
lavender from Provence Threatens Climate Change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is falling due to drought conditions and disease-carrying insects, which is a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert in the agronomic research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change, which caused much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.
There is also a small cikade, a microbacteria that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are a great many of them. "
And the stakes are high.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, but also perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having a very long vegetable ear with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. '
The solutions that are being considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the ground, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
This year the town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhon celebrates its 1200th anniversary.
The peak is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
These days, cranes, guilds, traders, vagans or a land kneading slave are to be experienced in the city centre.
The assassination of a journalist underscores Mexico ’ s growing threat.
The Riodoce weekly staff usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials, and ceaseless drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: take their children to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, business people, journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s or cartels ’ payroll, a catalogue of criminals who are making Mexico ’ s mess dangerous.
There is no respite from violence, and while bodies are multiplying throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 following attacks and threats under federal protection; and, so far, at least seven deaths have been recorded in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her editor and the inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a Special Federal Prosecutor ’ s Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the Sinaloa violence, even though they are no consolation and the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to discuss security, says Ibarra.
"It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
'As long as we do not know why, we distrust everyone. '
On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of the state of Culiac..,,,,,,,,,,
He was only able to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Twelve River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to travel freely around Culialan.
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the Valdez issue.
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields, with rival factions fighting to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot in the street, or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-story mausoleums for drug kings, which are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of 'calm' when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke up with the fault that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman ’ s sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, but suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $50 in equity.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in tracking Mexican drug history wherever it went.
He freely admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompento-TV.
"You have to do the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I do not want to be asked: 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why did you not say what was going on?'
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the bird of fun that could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his undoing?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and remain alive.
"You don't like to deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa, as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where Riodoce ’ s security training workers met, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed, and days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were charged by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiac.
Half jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50% of police whom the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, which focused on the governor ’ s home town.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiac, a block away from the prosecutor ’ s office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew: that the restaurant was a favorite place for drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled all political levels almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile corruption cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have seen Valdez ’ s column as the most informed source of abduction.
"We would have known what happened in the past," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flamenco" because of its slim body texture.
'All channels of communication with our sources are now broken '.
Valdez ’ s office has been converted into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalists ’ murders, because employees have become something they would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries there to gain international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
She has since asked for her to be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organised crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his last book Narco Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also by orders from politicians and security forces who were in thrall with organized crime.
Last year, the media watchdog group "Articulo 19" allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want you to keep your mouth shut," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Their body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: 'I am here because of my reports'.
A computer keyboard and headphones located next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others are continuing, as the El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled 'What do you want from us?'
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who, together with four women, was murdered in a flat in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz in 2015.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that is why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office on the sidewalk and drank beer when all their phones suddenly started to hump.
A number of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of antitrust embassies in the region.
From the edge of the curb they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez cast a glance at the police who kept guards to see if they were in readiness.
If they were afraid, they did not show it.
The newspaper ’ s fallen founder, whose midfinger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, was followed by Riodoce ’ s staff.
'How can you think of closing it down, 'Bojorquez said,' when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets to report. '
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the initial findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaur".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said it had had some of a "restless past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" referred to him as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaur, which lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous period.,,, and.,, and.
Its incredibly well preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as' truly remarkable '.
According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivor is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub at the Suncor Millenium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met with something that seemed out of place of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the world's 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) cluster.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be unveiled.
"If you blink a little with your eyes, you might almost believe it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
'It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur '.
Researchers have found that although this herbivores are covered with armor and resemble a changing tank, they are likely to be threatened by carnivores eating meat.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as a counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed him to become better acquainted with his surroundings and to evade his enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.
The 110 million year old Nodosaur family creature made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours uncovering it.
The amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered contouring, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although contouring is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution encouraged the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals using contouring - think of roe deer, zebras, or girdle animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nonosaur was facing a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predators on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk age must have been," said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it had eaten as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he went into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today.
"This Nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just shoot a little with your eyes, you might almost think it's sleeping. "
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaur standing on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocantosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray, north of Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to hip.
The average creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch peaks protruding from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that the armored herbivore was flooded by Western Canada until an flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armour in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover holdout tank plates along the dinosaur's surface.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a gain in the lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified remains of the skin are still covered by the haphazard armour plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole '.
Storm: Mass Carambush on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass karambolage.
There are many injured, kilometres of congestion and gaffer.
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass karambolage on late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, about 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen terminals (district of Aichach-Friedberg) about 30 vehicles, probably including trucks, were connected during a thunderstorm.
At first, no information was available on the exact number of people who were injured.
They are minor to medium injuries, said a police officer.
A large collection of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backlog of about ten kilometres was formed.
As one AZ reporter reports, there were massive obstacles on the other track - caused by numerous gaffer.
The fire department took note of the vehicle drivers' licence plates, which now face severe penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45 there was another accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
This led to a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group is testing 'Comfort Check-in'
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced: you sit in the train and sleep with nothing to look at.
Or you are deepened in your work and just have a brilliant idea.
And then: bufff.
The conductor comes and wakes an unsoftly or pulls the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the periods of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing its ticket control system.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and thus devalue your ticket.
Currently a test operation runs on two tracks.
"When the offer comes, we extend it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a rail spokesman.
"Comfort Check-in" is the name given by the train to the devaluation of the ticket without a conductor.
In order to be able to use them, however, a number of requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
You also have to buy it via the train, which DB Navigator purchased, which is anyway the most convenient way to book your ticket. () (,,, etc.
Last but not least, you need a seat reservation...........
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you get into the train and call your ticket under "My Tickets".
The test customers will then receive a button for electronic validation.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to number Y at the ticket control desk, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
You can therefore continue to sleep, work, remain silent.
Check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit passengers.
"If you want to travel by our train crew without having to check in the DB Navigator, you can do it yourself.
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time by train, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB long-distance transportation.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missing trains, the checks on tickets are one of the biggest problems.
Because often you don't have all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets, but in any case one of travellers.
Either the credit card or ID card is missing or any other document that has to be presented.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or the large room and delays in checking your own ticket and ultimately takes the conductor time to deal with other issues.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this only applies to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Sutgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Other numbers on the same route have not yet been activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Born sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone in high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the streets," they said.
Confused because nobody else had posted the information on their feed, closed it Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweet on her timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was singing live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white cop in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted an image of Brown ’ s lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police band and people shouting, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who had a sign saying: 'Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!'
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bark dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman escaped his gun and shouted: "I'll kill you... animals all."
"This is not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
'This is not the kind of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call typical '.
At that moment I felt chills.
I was furious and wept. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father ’ s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson over the following three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas since the 11th century.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, from the point of view of the people who live in the community and who filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state «.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I could not take them with me, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be brought up in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to become free, to liberate ourselves.
Although I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black female child.
I have the feeling that I would do her a disservice by keeping her out of it. '
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a site opposite the police force that became a camp site when the activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
Ferrell and her daughter were there with a local business owner who had lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to protesters.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri St Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. '
Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: 'Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?'
That skepticism was fed by countless cases of people, often whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan said in a recent interview, 'We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their votes and we wanted to do it differently'.
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death clause inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals the team of "Whose Streets?" followed in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us," said Davis.
'That was the main thing for me as to how these people are represented, because that is how I will be portrayed. '
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
'But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people. '
In addition, Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the death of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and that is why we are constantly fighting on various fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. '
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
"She was the person who shook up this energy," she said.
"It is not by chance, although she was at the forefront, because in a life on these crossings, as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel your energy through the screen. '
Meanwhile, news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but racial links between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is suspended for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the social and political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A Chaos".
Yet she is clinging to a song and she has been committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. '
From Dream to megalomania: TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery
The Bit-Gallery moves people, although it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold is hardly a topic.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the Bit-Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schasten), comes from the other side: "Does not need any man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters rely on one gallery to attract more customers, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned on the site where the farmer market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will stop at the start of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmer market hall almost every week for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady always very happy.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
Other cities do.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt in particular is interesting. '
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
This should not be particularly low in the new project. '
Eva Kilic: "What shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Be it clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I find this superfluous.
There are enough of them in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not viable for a retailer.
It is a pity that there are almost no more special shops, and what remains of them is likely to disappear. '
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farmer's market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term, if the Bit-Gallery eventually actually comes.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to sell all shops out of Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "It just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market, rather than this gallery.
However, thanks to the incredible number of - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no place for a farming market hall.
If the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. '
A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning ’ s DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery room in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg of Wangen-Tupforten und Haarschnitten, sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after publicizing classified diplomatic messages via WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Rememblance (A similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transvestite and path-pointing dissident, whose conviction was commuted to by Barack Obama when he had only three days left office.
Through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning, which created 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data, Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, if intellectual, commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about female identification since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six breaches of the espionage law, computer fraud, and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photograph - a granular, black and white Selfie, in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumps and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste in order to create an image of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen-friends who exchanged several letters over two years.
They even created a comic strip called "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, predicting a future in which President Chelsea's verdict would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
Indeed, just days after the book was published, Obama ’ s demand for Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informers from the government ’ s camp and Transgender troops to find new, tweeted ways to inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to correct.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the 'automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture, with her oversized signature of it (the' i 'in her family name is marked with a heart).'
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth foot of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all, by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist ’ s advanced scientific lexicon).
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so there are 30 of them."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a private room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning, as she appears with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States such as King Kong.
"When they cut your speech, they won," it says.
'So never stop your mouth '.
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
'I still get goose bumps when I talk about it '.
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as was anticipated in the comic book - but if it does, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulations that coalesce like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning's statue), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
'I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind its liberation. '
Professor of Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee for killing
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee to be sought as a suspect after a man had been fatally injured in a luxury Chicago apartment.
On Monday, warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) on charges of murder for alleged involvement in the death of Trent H. James Cornel-Duranleau, as evidenced by the files of the Cook County Court.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community alert system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornel-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the incident, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubboste, vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been certified and has been barred from entering Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A University and Somerville College spokesman said in an e-mail statement that 'we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible'.
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office, Anthony Guglielmi, said he was urging the suspects to confront the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the property manager of the Grand-Plaza building who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: 'The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim, researching a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident'.
'We will complete the WADA road map in the near future '- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the roadmap criteria, RUUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA timetable has been updated in this regard, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA ’ s roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization ’ s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
As regards the matter, Mutko said: 'We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has acknowledged a mistake.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no public programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist. '
His words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In talks with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past to Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.
In November 2015, in the wake of the doping scandal, RUNADA was excluded from conducting doping checks in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization ’ s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA-Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi does not sell eggs for the time being.
This was shared by the business groups.
The communication stated that it was a mere precaution that no health impact could be expected.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi that have been proven to have been negatively tested on fistronic anti-lice.
Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency for his customers.
The Start-ups that will help your business not to become the next Uber.
Amy Erett wanted to measure the happiness of your employees in their e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Responses have often been vague, unhelpful, or – worse – fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Eratt, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.
It has called for help from outside.
A new race of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and approach the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is the fit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errutt said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glinn.
In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units most complaints have and which executives have low approval results - so that you can follow why.
Companies come to realize that you must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber to be involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For Start-Ups like Glinn, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in value in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailored "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has captured regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or is unethical, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, worker flight, and lawsuits, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, has spent more than a year trying to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company ’ s headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said that there was no good way to track staff complaints.
Now that Convercent is deploying, problems previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair internships – can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes'.
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took the "social media right" for companies to recognize that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Sprint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that is supported by venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in February financing from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising all capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing all its financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
There is a growing set of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company that listens to their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are running well, and businesses are doing well when employees are engaged and committed.
When third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and commitment, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture important.
But the data are useless if a company ’ s managers do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it may have an expectation that change is underway.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on data collection.
"Because if you do not follow employees will ask themselves," Have you really heard me?
Do you care about that?
And who do not care, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about glitch, so excited.
And, after gaining feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company continues to gain new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to better retention of workers in an industry that is known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins.
The game starts at 11 pm, when a lot of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team's new practice fields on the campus.
Some have removed their trikoto parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in summer courses will return to their final exams after three hours of exercise before returning to the Aquarius Football Center at 6: 30 the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday's turn to Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
This is why the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and did practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are expected to conduct 18 exercises during August, 20 before the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the change in NCAA rules, even if they add another point to players' busy routes.
"We place this enormous burden three or four days on them, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they continue to plague themselves, they are great people.
I think that as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. '
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp has finished, which will not be an easy task, given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the highest class that has already been promoted with footballs that provided a safety net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people there rent a room and then prepare to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it is quite good business.
But we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I am therefore not too worried.
We have a plan. '
Facebook wants to step up fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to third-party fact-checking agents, and then display their results under the original paper, the world ’ s largest online social network said Thursday, and is one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to fact-auditors who may display the results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has become a major political issue in Europe, too, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings, as they did before the September election.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
"Besides recognizing what stories are challenged by third-party fact-checking, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Making a comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has lived 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewll River Valley in Kent, and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mocphaarian Yorkshire madman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands'.
A Castle in England spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney.
It is not the first book from Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly found emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That is his thumbs!
And letters always smell smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were there.
Oh, I love archives! '
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I have a little overrated my welcome"), this all seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, exploring the archives and exploring the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape carers, gardeners and sometimes artists working on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "whiskey and started to write".
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust won full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to look after the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the roof ".
diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.
Guys, let everything go his way! '
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for a broader exploration of English history, including The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a rebellion that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Perhaps the two are linked? '
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Jesuit priest who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own burial by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The lords seemed to be quite a crook, repeatedly debt and spend money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men resolved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome boys, with a talent to recruit heirs. "
After the end of his mission to the castle, Rhodes is in search of other unique writing experiences.
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like: 'Oh, now I have to deal with the damned life again'.
Campaign: Filled over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf
With the unveiling of the 301 year old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand (Thursday ’ s Rundschau).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his Nelson Artz marketing team will keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or? ", ask the organisers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't think this (of course!
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that, as Bad Honnefer, we citizens are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city. '
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"We must formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique position".
After all, they compete with other communities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new umbrella brand and campaign a mid five-digit amount.
Military reform in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
This week.
At first glance a normal procedure.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.
The sitting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as was the case in the past, but in the Prime Minister's office.
Under the leadership of the Heads of State or Government, the five Vice-Premier and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions.
As a result, the number of civilians in the YAS was higher.
The government is taking the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces, and the navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, Erdoğan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army ’ s ranks, mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
There have been some 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had already called the coup attempt a "gift of God," giving him the opportunity to "clean up" the armed forces completely.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army??
At the end of February the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uneasiness at Military Headquarters".
In the General Staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the lifting of the ban on headscarves for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
The wholesale cleaning up of the army and the security forces is continuing.
In mid-July, Erdoğan issued a decree to fire another 7395 civil servants, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
Erdoğan seemed to have tamed the military.
The generals used to be the actual masters of the country.
They fought three times, invoking their role as guardians of the secular order of state.
Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan gradually pushed back the power of the military, not least on the basis of the European Union ’ s reform requirements.
Former officers say that Erdogan is pursuing a targeted Islamization of the armed forces.
In the 'Vocal Europe' magazine, a nameless officer who sought asylum abroad for fear of persecution after the coup attempt warned that in a few years' time the Turkish army would be 'full of extremists and Salafists'.
If so, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, after the purges, the Alliance has doubts about the commitment of the Turkish army.
NATO diplomats say that leadership structures and operational capabilities are 'weakened'.
The Green Card Rules in Washington
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the green card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It aims to reduce legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
'This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and it will do so by changing the way the US spends green cards on citizens from other countries. '
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and to show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, quoted by the American media.
The Ministry wants to renovate the Race Yards
Over the past few months the future of the Rennsteingshuttle had been disputed again and again - now it is to be done very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is planned to build on the ramshackle route on which the tourist train is going.
According to the Ministry of Transport, in order to secure the future of the Rennsteingshuttle in the long term, construction work on the track should start this year.
"With the decision to continue to order and rehabilitate the route Ilmenau Rennsteig, the country is committed to this link, which is particularly important for tourism," declared the Secretary of State for Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He put the cost of repairing the route at around EUR 2.5 million.
The country takes 75% of that amount.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future, will be finally voted on at the moment, Sühl declared.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operator already agree on the technical details.
"This negotiated the road map, the vehicles used and the quality standards," Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the race track shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a popular railway connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations.
In recent months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by enough people to re-order it regularly in the future.
The route is also very ramshackle in some parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry.
Just when you thought that 2017 could not be even more insane, there is a new report on technological developments in sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal at the moment.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot ’ s eye color, shape of the nipple, and type of finger nail.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are making a lot of them and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm, with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can "adjust" his robot according to his / her beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples, to the type or color of his / her nails.
But it becomes even more worrying because many robots have the "personalities" who would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicon skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there is the Roxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah, which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," flatters the site of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
Over the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation, or she can be "in mood"!
There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female traits, the references to rape when one takes a step to Frigid (say, reluctant) Farrah, worry one of the most.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what seeps from the periphery can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap between these highly developed sex robots appearing at a time when women ’ s rights worldwide are under threat, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually attacking women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' Der Report der Magd ') is not the graphic images, the swallowed bodies and the foiled eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap forward, but at the moment it does not feel like a leap forward.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with porn proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to put it bluntly, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
You cannot disconnect from your pet or simply walk away.
They have no mediation or background, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are happy slaves.
Or, to put it in 2017, servant girls
Trump ’ s Great Performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also split small families.
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival, the US has had newspapers advising on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s voting relatives.
We are all supposed to take action to let our filter bubbles burst.
Trump ’ s power to bring families together has been less noted.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been concerned with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and uniquely on the same side.
That is certainly a good thing about the table, but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the distorting effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we speak of “normalization, ” and Trump, we refer to the scary possibility that one day his antics will no longer be repelled.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes ” right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality relative to his standards.
Today, I am struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s hilarious version of the madman – the dog on the car roof, which had a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax returns were) – both of which, compared to Trump, seem to be a very mild crime.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate needs only to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of New York's car parks carousel, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are sticky and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders in fear - extremely dark, and the shrimping music strangely conveys this.
Disappointing so many clichés about a city: the views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines become too familiar to be agitated, and the reality of the city is not up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a major roundabout in northern London.
The Central Park Carousel, however, is still a strangely magical experience, as two two years of age, an 11-year old and two women in the 40-year period can go on and all have a great time.
If I had been able to assess the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked.
On the other hand, in a department store this week, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to put someone in a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood excruciatingly grinning, while I tired of the experience of reaching her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius Moved from Prison to Hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a second visit to hospital.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, he suffered after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal from the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine ’ s Day in 2013, shooting her several times through a door of the toilet booth in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecution Service said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four graders from Fützen and Eppenhofen were dismissed for holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the discharge students will go to high school in the future, four to secondary school.
On Tuesday evening, head of school Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the citizens' house in Biesental in Eppenhofen.
As a symbol of school leaving, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but is released into freedom.
The lively crowd performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hennerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it be incubated by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken bowl, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was shattered, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank ’ s set-up.
The hens danced with the young Gocks who wore cylinders to the bet.
The Eagle stands for integration, said head of school Angelika Sitte.
The kitten is different from the other kittens (chicks) but belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His rule is to be free.
She wished every four plaintiff to feel accepted in his new school.
A word of thanks followed to former school manager Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps into school passes, and the parents' representatives.
The Kükenzeit is now over, declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
They are very reluctant to dismiss their students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the Fourth Fathers.
At the end of the course, all students learned a song of summer time and holiday time.
The children enjoyed it.
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted on television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegally staying people, including the two Bulgarians, was arrested by the police in Sithonia.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose significant fines on anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for that purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the stakeholders need to know now.
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should diesel drivers participate in the campaign?
Overview of the most important questions and answers.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission performance of emission class cars Euro 5 and Euro 6 in part.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have software for cheating," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Office of Power Vehicles (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has informed everyone concerned to write.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its scope.
How long should the overall changeover be delayed?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and political pressure.
'We have seen voluntary action by car manufacturers on the environment. '
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises you to wait.
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, says Smetanin.
Is there a massive fall in the price of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
However, it is precisely in the regions where there is a threat of driving bans.
There has been no loss of value in rural areas for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
The Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards.
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday, this year, there will be the presence of the singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the ceremony with his wife Melania.
As a result, Lear announced that he would not participate in the gala.
He said to the New York Times: 'This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that is a burden on me'.
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to explain her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
Making the City Worth of Life
Roland Wacker, Haslach ’ s master builder, will retire next year.
The job has already been put out to tender, but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city architect for 31 years.
And he still enjoys his work as he communicates in the press interview.
He reports of varied but also challenging tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application meets the requirements.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest opportunity.
In this way, there should be enough time to prepare the report, taking into account the regular periods of notice.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Construction Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the Applicant must have appropriate qualifications.
The city wants to keep this function.
If they were no longer able to fill them, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate and a good mood between the public and the public.
In more than 30 years in office, several important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living", he is assured of the construction office and its employees.
In the future, however, a number of varied projects will also be on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, are under way.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium reconstruction is still under discussion.
The latter alone will be worth about 1.5 million euros, "if we get it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. '
There is a lot of room for manoeuvre for a city architect.
With Haslach ’ s own farm and horticulture, you can respond to a lot of things very flexibly.
"There is a lot to be done," Wacker said, and citizens and visitors often praise the design of green areas.
As the old town as an ensemble is protected by historical monuments, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city architect emphasizes.
In any case, the city ’ s architect bears a great deal of responsibility.
He is a builder, "at the end everything runs over my table".
He can count on many years of staff when it comes to supervision and coordination: Markus Neumaier (civil engineering) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been involved for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay long: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the place and stay there".
Continuity is important not only for a good working environment, but also for the further development of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should, according to the town of Haslach, have a degree in engineering or a bachelor's degree in architecture, and have a good knowledge of building regulations and planning law.
The town planning office is responsible for civil engineering, structural planning, basic employment matters, administration of urban properties, the municipal farm with a building yard and a municipal horticultural plant, as well as Lower Construction Law Authority, including protection of monuments.
Wheeled Bicycle: South railway closed.
According to the police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and look for them since the night hours.
A pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses near the scene.
"This goes far beyond a prank," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch on APA.
The perpetrator would have placed himself in great danger and also put rail transport at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement, the customers of the railway could also be the victims.
In general, the speaker said that a "significant" sum should be considered.
The damage was rectified on Friday afternoon and rail traffic on the southern rail route could be carried out without any obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not stop, but they were late.
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch, some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable state of affairs, which affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and bulges, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, loss of weight and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote tolerant intestines.
The chief researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments found that a kind of tolerant immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their bowels.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial species - lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiotim, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells.
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes a more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environment when the same system also affects humans.
The postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes arragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, had not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microorganisms of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice ’ dams were DNA sequenced, and six bacteria strains were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but were absent from mice.
mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a intestinal microbiotim and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria had an impact on the immune system, researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells became the tolerant cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol 3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when tryptophane values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes Baragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan derivatives from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophane in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed Nemanja Matic to a "genius".
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genius", Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea's signature started with a 2: 1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira went ahead at will.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues preparatory Asia tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later '.
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to fulfill three of its four priority commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club," he added.
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have gone to great lengths. '
Boeing 'paints' Dreamliner to Heaven
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state Michigan and took the form of a Dreamliner over the U.S., which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.
New setback for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem.
How the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain amount of concern before elections.
No troublemaking from the central party, only no headwind from the federal government - that was the main wish of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the members of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching with growing horror the events in the SPD-governed capitals.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the beginning with headwinds.
They were blows.
One by one.
The Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Rot-Grün simply cannot govern reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network (RND).
A Green MP ’ s surprising outturn has thrown Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) ’ s government into a serious crisis.
Five months before the presidential election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition.
Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on Elke Twesten, the resigning Green MP in Lower Saxony, to return.
The transition to the CDU is a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twests must immediately return its mandate, "said the Federal Executive Director and campaign manager of the Greens to the German editorial network (RND).
"All this must not be true," exclaims a SPD campaign as the new Hiobs message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands without a majority of his own after the Green MEP Elke Twests joined the CDU.
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional federations.
And no one knows what will come next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the federal elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That became so - and it all became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the fray, the Düsseldorf-bust upended the party.
In the following weeks, the comrades began to struggle again.
Then, when they had just acquired new courage, the G20 summit in Hamburg came.
And with him came the next blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because, in crisis communication, he subsequently made pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has struggled for political survival.
Now Stephan Weil.
The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticized for some time because of the VW exhaust scandal and his role in the Supervisory Board.
Some survey figures have been added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps for that very reason, Weil has been trying to set the tone in the past few weeks.
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden by comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They let him be granted because they promised to stabilize the party by Weil.
The opposite could happen.
Because, in fact, the Dutch Greens are not to blame for the party infighting.
And Schulz certainly not.
For the time being, therefore, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and especially at the departing parliamentarian, Mr Twens.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Mrs Twens puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of party left in the SPD Bundestag faction, the editorial network Deutschland (RND).
Mrs Twests was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but because of the Lower Saxony Greens' list of countries, so the Lower Saxony Member continues.
The logical consequence would be to return its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag faction, complains of an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The will of voters four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result," said Oppermann.
He asked for the background to be clarified.
I would like to know whether there has been more or whether the CDU in Lower Saxony has made further commitments.
Local centre III funding
If you want to renovate your old house, you will soon be able to get support from the country.
On Wednesday, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG informed about urban development.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what had happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been areas of rehabilitation in sensitive areas.
At that time, in the redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is important, after all, to promote internal development and not just to open up new construction areas.
On April 4, the Karlsruhe Government Bureau informed us that there would be a redevelopment area III.
The funding was EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country, the rest of the community would feel.
How is a redevelopment area being created?
According to Schindler, we will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
It also has a role to play, however, as to whether there is any interest in renovating the planned area.
If necessary, the area boundaries could then be shifted again.
On Wednesday evening, the STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City", under which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an objective basis, i.e. per property.
The rehabilitation area would then be defined as a statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the grant period has been extended to 30 April 2026.
By September of this year, however, we would first take stock of the situation, in which a questionnaire would be sent to those involved in the rehabilitation area to complete it.
In November or December, as far as possible, the decision on the statute will be taken so that next year we can start the process of rehabilitation.
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing urban problems and deciding when to repair them and to what extent.
A redevelopment notice will be entered in the land registry for each property.
Pietzschmann will come to his senses again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.
There will therefore be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and which can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Property Sheet", which deals, among other things, with the building condition and the redevelopment plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "home and apartment sheet", information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be provided.
The blue "operating sheet" is only to be filled if the premises are operated in the building.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
Moreover, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies works according to the "greyhound principle" - if you come first, you will be able to choose first.
You cannot "reserve" any funds for later.
At the end, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make the present "tasty" rehabilitation.
British inventors set themselves a microchip to move home and car by hand.
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand move.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an additional charge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House ’ s Advertising Costs to Taxpayers Thousands
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlighted American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military that was handed over to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exhibited next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire brigade car, and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his boss, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn at 3 p.m. on 17 July at 7 a.m. for the event, and that it remained until the grass was cleared from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. this evening.
The note adds that if departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restrictions on working hours.
The original flight crew was on the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time.
It was not clear from the records made available to the TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data records indicate that HMMX-1 asked if the event could break the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Sounds as if you were closed," replied the Deputy Commander.
The Made in America event was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to contain government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But to request their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential plane offered taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of complaints about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled by the show" Made In America "- showing products from all 50 countries made by American workers with American materials," said the White House Deputy Secretary of the Press, Lindsay Walters.
HMS 1 crews often carry out training flights around Washington and South Lawn to sell the US president to the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMMX-1 held 58 practice sessions in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said one official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for “non-presidential support missions. ”
The White House said that taxpayers did not take the burden on any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in displaying the helicopter on South Lawn.
HMMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly rates from the US Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD refund for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate.
'Setting taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates of the reimbursement rates is highly misleading, 'said Walters.
'These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds'.
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance, and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter ’ s use for the event.
"The idea is to present things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to stress this. '
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his South Lawn tour for the event, but he sat in the driver ’ s seat of a fire brigade car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
'I know Sikorsky very well ', the President said,' I have three of them '.
The tricky task of TC BW Neuss
The German Tennis Federation ’ s top tennis league is joining the ranks of the German Tennis League ’ s third stripper SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow at 11: 00 in Kiel with the third team in the German Bundesliga.
Despite five matches, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality.
Head of the team Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
I find the team very good at the back. '
In the long run, however, the team has been able to keep up with the pace of the team.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double ", says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerregaard (all Denmark).
"As always, this will be difficult for us.
You also need a good dose of happiness. '
The Neusser team for the trip to the far north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is currently active at the Challenge Tournament in Biella, Italy, will be playing for the first time this season.
The previously unconquered Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belorussia Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandhump, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories against the club at the Alster last Sunday, Máté Valkusz could once again join the team.
Not enough for 18-year-old Hungary, who was the number one junior world ranking in January 2016, someone from the coaching club around Marius Zay fills the squad.
How America Can Bad OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law tightening sanctions against Russia Wednesday evening.
"In its haste to pass the law," the Congress packed in some "unconstitutional provisions," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was as strong as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US move.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors from the Austrian OMV, which, together with other European companies, is co-funding the construction of the Russian Baltic railway line Nord Stream 2, have been similarly worried.
The threatening backdrop is enormous.
But it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the oil company ’ s official statement.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at what the Group could do to fend off and which could really hurt it.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel in the Netflix hit series will be brought to the fore.
Despite the second season of Narcos revealed to Pablo Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villain of the show.
With the third season, DEA has focused its attention on the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful sponsors, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will start on September 1.
Scroll backwards: The city employs 46 kitchen aids.
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With permanent contact for the children and a assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city nurseries.
On September 1, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the municipal Kindertagesanlagen (Kitas) again in its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Director of Youth Aid, this is good news: 'We were all very pleased'.
Cooking is still done outside the house: a caterer takes care of this task and supplies freshly cooked dishes chilled.
The city operates 46 nurseries in the Krefelder area, and in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past Kitajahr, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours per week have lunch in Kita", explains Pommeranz.
'The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m. '
From 1 September, 46 part-time workers will have a kitchen service: they will warm up the delivered food, add salad, raw food and fruit, individually portionate the meal, dispense the food, clear it, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"Employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the number of hours.
"The kitchen workers are now firmly part of the kita-team", says Pommeranz satisfied.
"Thus, they are much more involved and it is easier for the Kitaleting to implement pedagogical concepts".
Because that is also what it is all about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food".
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
For children too.
"They have a known force in Kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the kitchen rooms - also the task of the kitchen staff until now - will be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only improved the quality of the kitchen service, but also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical for the city in terms of cost comparisons between self administration and foreign procurement, according to the press office.
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours are less important for some 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN.
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, President-in-Office of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will stand in provincial elections, with three women standing for the role of Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters being women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections to the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincided with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will peacefully transfer power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will enhance Afghanistan ’ s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered from a total of 3.6 million registered voters.

Men Trying to rob 13-year-old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was at Kolpingstraße with friends, about 2.55 p.m., because they wanted to telephone with the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends.
In response, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl ’ s cell phone and neck, which failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is under way.
GMB worries about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to check with managers of Biskup manufacturer McVitie the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company had remained silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the plant, which manufactures, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits.
McVitie ’ s owner, Pladis, said he had invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be "first experienced" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to "express concern that funding for the modernization of production lines would not be pushed forward".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is heavily concentrated on the local community and the Greater Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the perspective of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs, and chronic output decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie. "
A spokeswoman from Pladis said: "The managing director at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly, as we appreciate the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with staff and GM representatives at Tollcross, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with the staff that we, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and insecure economic climate, are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site and, if our operations at the site change, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know. '
Did the PSG Barcelona warn against Neymar three years ago?
The League side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not slacken in their pursuit of Neymar after offering £189 million to trigger its release clause, but three years ago did they warn Barcelona of the world record crash?
The sensational approach fueled the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world record by more than double the previous one, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After finishing, Neymar becomes the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest paid professional athlete, offering wages of more than GBP.
Barcelona is furious at the way in which Neymar has forced his way out, though a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to look after him since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
But was the soccer world warned about this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to have one of the best players signed by PSG.
"I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelafi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players signed with them, they will have consequences. '
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international one from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roller Turned and Damaged
During the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw a scooter parked in Königfelder Strasse in front of the estate number 30, causing material damage of more than 200 euros on the cover of the vehicle.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, asks for information.
In an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police is looking for witnesses.
Because a car met him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to avoid and hit the track.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum took his VW to Leese on the B 215 from Stolzenau at around 19.55.
In the area around Stolzenau, a car came to him on his lane, so he had to turn right.
The Touran driver tampered with the track.
Physical damage was caused by cars.
The driver of the welcoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the 'polluter pays' vehicle to contact the 'Commissioniat' in Stolzenau by phone 05761 / 92060.
Interview: 'Domspatzen report discharges the papacy brother Georg Ratzinger'
The Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves the burden of the Papst brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what the author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen continues to give rise to discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church", declared after publication to the German Press Agency that he expects an apology from the former bishop of Regensburg and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the celebrated Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly benefit the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of what was happening at the time.
The Vatican newspaper, "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the use of 'double standards' in reporting on violence in the Cathedral jokes.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but what is striking is the "degree of media manipulation", according to the author Lucetta Scarafbia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scarafbia.
In an interview with the Bavarian Radio, Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said: "It is a pleasure to go to the church and that is a picnic".
She also pointed out that in her youth, 'blows were a normal pedagogical tool' to deal with naughty children, as I was one. '
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of cases of abuse, the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the commemorative book "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages) is completely wrong.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440 page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was appointed to investigate by the diocese of Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with a high degree of plausibility".
The final report on Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, states: "In summary, it can be noted that in many cases Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence.
Particularly with high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe.
However, in contrast to many other accused, it is striking that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even associate positive memories with him ".
In the interview, Hesemann explains why he considers the final report on the scandal of abuse to relieve Georg Ratzinger.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of the use of force on protected persons in the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen" gives a contradictory picture of the master master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight their "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist, who often became handy when a Domspatz musically did not deliver top performance.
How do you regard this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it.
Only eight pages are devoted to it and it is clearly cleared of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of effect.
At best, he can be accused of learning too late, or of not taking early hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, give excellent testimony, describing him as' warm ',' popular ',' honest ',' competent 'and' sympathetic ', a very kind teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was' always surrounded by grapes from children '.
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has already led to clashes.
He acknowledged, deeply regretted and apologised for the fact that he not only cracked with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also drew ears and ears for overly cheeky boys.
In order to save his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and among teachers.
Do you also know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is all about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and excessive violence at pre-school, these are, of course, trivial things.
One wonders if it is not his fame and role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media have fallen upon him.
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently with the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In connection with the report, a great deal has been reported in the media on the subject of abuse in the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused in the final report of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Absolutely no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted himself to the Cathedral Chapel Master.
Not even the parents were open.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about this," one person said on behalf of the others, "I was very embarrassed."
The real problem in educating about sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they were not even entrusted to parents and siblings, it would certainly not have been a choir leader who, in a way, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in his professional capacity.
How do you judge Ratzinger's role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: As one student put it: "Regarding sexual abuse... I don't see a case where he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it is also really absurd to think that it is precisely him who... boys have opened up more intrusive, clearer or even earlier than their parents, head of boarding schools, confidence teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. '
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion: 'The fact that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation'.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any complicity.
In this way, he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to trial.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
There was a lot of talk in the media about "excesses of violence" in the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen.
The former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report of "looking the other way".
Must he live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything in the report has been mixed up and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, again, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clear distinction between pre-school and high school, between sexual abuse and excessive violence and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral conductor of the Cathedral Spatzen.
All the terrible teaching of caning, the cases in which boys were really harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered appalling, occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Georg Ratzinger, the master of the cathedral, had nothing to do with them, because he only saw the boys when they were already on the cathedral's gymnasium.
On this, as most witnesses emphasize, the theme "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the much better treatment and, for many, even "paradise" conditions.
What was different on the Domspatzgymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with it despite violence".
At most, there is still a charge of looking the other way.
Despite all the efforts, however, the report has only been able to define two periods of time during which it was informed of conditions at pre-school.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and did not want to hear of the events at a school in which he was not active and responsible (according to the witness), and then only again in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the situation?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as long ago as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Cemetery, which the report even reproduces.
He pointed out to them that 'caning continues to be practised in preschool'.
Even in view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when caning was banned long ago in Bavaria too.
Before that, they were in a legal grey area, as all of us still know.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the people concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
Nor can we say that he has always looked the other way.
That is simply not true.
It was not until 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
After all, Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to those days.
How do you see this?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "trap of anachronism", that is, the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.
The lady is quite right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, nor to the atrocities committed against innocent children ’ s souls in pre-school, which goes far beyond what was then common.
That is all quite terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is to say, pulling earlobes and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he also adhered strictly to it.
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger present in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the topic of caning also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI., tells from his perspective, since the parities played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not at all hide the fact that he led a strict regime there.
But this must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, he would hardly have been able to form an institution of world renown from the so far more nationally known Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and sweets alone, you don ’ t make the most of recalcitrant boys and you ’ ll face every success in any field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As a human, did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and I have seen him again and again as wonderful, humourous, good-natured, deeply believing and good-natured people, of whom it is impossible to imagine that he could do anything for a fly.
I get to know on a regular basis how many former victims of the cathedral still have contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family, 23 years after his.
Those who still do not forgive him for being strict with them are clearly in a minority.
Today, most of the Domspats are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a loveable respecter, to whom they still look up today and who they almost worship.
And please, let us be clear once again: all that is being reproached is methods of education that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this period.
But it is highly unjust to turn a man into a media scapegoat simply because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind this is all too obvious.
The report that has just been published relieves it.
Now, decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man who has earned himself great merit and without whom, outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, no one would know the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen, finally be at peace.
