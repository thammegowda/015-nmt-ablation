Munich 1856 : Four cards that change your view of the city .	-2.6193
An astounding institution where young people are to meet today .	-5.9992
A pit chapel , where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel .	-5.4134
Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers .	-3.8086
The oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories .	-3.2613
It annoys if maps are not current .	-2.8185
Everybody knows that , because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-5.6077
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas , an offer of the Geoportals of Bavaria of the state government , are far from current - but it is precisely for this reason that they are very revealing .	-6.9570
Especially if you compare them with current online cards .	-2.7639
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the nineteenth century in the field of distribution of the Munich Merkur . , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.3930
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that you cannot recognize as such .	-4.0045
In the large overview map , detailed maps of cities and municipalities , so-called Urpositionsblätter , have been included .	-7.4603
These were created according to the Bayerischer Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and originated the first survey of Bayerns .	-5.9014
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.3167
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-3.8684
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria for military purposes .	-5.8195
Even though French troops eventually withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9 , 1801 , it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map .	-5.6365
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project , founded the Topographische Bureau and thus the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung .	-5.3072
The Munich Urpositionsblatt dates back to 1856 and , like all others , can be found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek website .	-4.5028
The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .	-5.4074
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.2070
One example of this is subsendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.8272
Sendling was included 21 years after drawing up the map , in other words in 1877 , as Munich 's district .	-5.3251
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city .	-3.4051
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the Plinganserstraße , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-4.1038
Where the West Park is today , nothing can be seen as fields - at first glance : a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand-numbered pieces of corridors from the so-called " Uraufnahme " , from which the base tax was derived .	-11.7221
Small parcels no longer show farmers there - but small gardeners of the land in sun .	-4.6386
A large green area is situated north of Untersendling .	-2.9792
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 site of the Oktoberfest , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert . .	-6.7947
On the other hand , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.2338
In the Urpositionsblatt , one reads not only the street name " at the Gasteig " or from the hill " on the lies " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-5.6661
Yes , here at the Auerfeldstraße , people were once locked up with flags .	-6.7262
In 1858 / 59 the Munich-Irrenanstalt " Auf der Auer Lüften " was born .	-3.8641
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - that psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-5.0121
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the anchoring of so-called errors .	-4.7653
He has also prohibited the staff from using violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Haidhausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .	-6.2816
For 280 patients there was first place , later 500 seats were extended .	-5.2437
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular irrenanstalt in Haar 1905 .	-4.7307
Since 2006 , the Isar Amper Clinic in Munich Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrists .	-5.0456
On the area of the former Auer Anstalt , young people in Munich now meet in Salesianum .	-5.5439
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training establishments .	-4.2167
Westlich lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost , east residential buildings from the 1980s .	-4.1595
In 2015 , the Children ’ s House “ Casa Don Bosco ” was built in architectural style on the grounds of the deception that had been destroyed by bombing during World War II .	-7.0994
The Marienplatz was named " Haupt Platz " at 1856 , the Kaufingerstraße was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.1434
A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .	-3.5105
In December 1944 , the Allies bombed many holes into the city centre .	-3.7700
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof .	-4.4801
The English Institute , small business houses and a medieval mine chapel were once standing at the Marienhof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich took place for the second S-Bahn ( city rail ) trail .	-11.9220
With the slider , the old coin card can be compared to the aerial image of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled .	-5.6445
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-2.3956
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to colored people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-4.2878
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travellers , visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention to travel through the state and to exercise extreme caution , since a number of dubious , race-based incidents have recently been occurring throughout the state and are recorded here , " says the Group 's opinion .	-7.5022
A recent law passed by Missouri , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination actions , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that are disproportionate to minorities , prompted the group to issue travel warning , said NAACP .	-6.0884
" They have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-2.9343
They are stopped because of their colour , they are beaten up or killed , " said the president of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.2560
" We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . "	-2.8621
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US .	-2.1945
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.0265
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during his journey by the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of crime .	-5.5829
The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Missouri , which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 % more likely than white people .	-6.0388
" The recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri , " Chapel said .	-3.6875
" People must be prepared to bring bail money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-5.0133
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI Hassverbrechens-Berichtsprogramm , which classifies the state as regards the number of such violations on the country ’ s 16th rank .	-4.4938
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.8521
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigrant attacks , which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling .	-5.1098
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.8597
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary	-1.2611
The Fischerbacher Weidezau project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.3659
The Christian Democrats Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have given an image on the ground .	-4.6857
At the Rechtgrabenhof der Familie Schwendemann , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-4.1806
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm , where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , fed 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests .	-7.9596
The " Black Forest Milk " is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , so Schwendemann .	-4.1221
The holiday guests ' table is exclusively regional .	-5.4559
Since he is also chairman of the BLHV association of Fischerbach , he called the Weidezaunprojekt a " elementary important " .	-6.0040
I cannot operate profitably on such steep surfaces .	-3.6362
The green area for a lot of work , much needs to be done with the engine sense .	-4.7427
" We are struggling with the conditions and topography here " , said Schwendemann .	-5.4590
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser , even if he does not run a biofarm .	-4.9688
For mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : " The local authorities recognized the importance of the Weidezaunprojekt and is pleased with the Leader-Förderung " .	-4.9498
Farmers should be supported at the cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare .	-3.3638
I hope that this will allow the reforestation of land to be extended for a long time .	-6.1823
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they continue to operate , " the mayor stressed .	-4.8606
Farmers are often criticized for promoting .	-3.1546
In 2013 , a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced up over wheat extraction .	-5.7320
The open area is 40 hectares which must not be explored by at least 2023 .	-5.3784
Of the total costs of EUR 71 500 , half was promoted via Leader , a quarter was carried by the Fischerbach municipality .	-5.4190
Thus , the farmers left EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of wheat .	-5.1750
" The big advantage is the longevity of fences , " said Swendemann .	-2.9520
Kordula Kovac emphasized : " You do a good job , without farmers and rural women do not ' .	-4.9980
Also for Peter Weiß stood firm : " Here the best food is produced " .	-4.3395
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of willow fences .	-3.9066
The objective is to open the Black Forest .	-3.8277
The precondition is the presence of a conveyor programme designated by the LPR .	-4.8698
Moreover , the area to be fenced must not be manageable ( over 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-5.6949
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the application is currently running by eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build nearly 16 .	-5.7854
The open area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-5.2309
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.3618
Now Trump ’ s White House is taking the Statue of Freedom	-5.3474
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues .	-2.8400
Americans , like any other , appreciate Saddam Hussein ’ s carefully staged overthrow in Baghdad in 2003 .	-4.0601
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta about the president ’ s proposals to curtail legal immigration with a statue of liberty .	-4.1614
To stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-2.0570
A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have sounded him if he had done so .	-3.0075
But he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance attributed to her when Emma Lazarus ’ famous poem was added in 1903 , 17 years after the monument ’ s completion .	-5.1377
As Miller Acosta appealed : " I do not want to dwell on a complete thing about history here , but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightened the world .	-7.8645
The poem you refer to was later added and not part of the original statue of liberty . '	-5.2013
Miller is right , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-4.4983
It is a question of contemporary resonance at the lofty words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mosquitos , your poor , / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely , / the elder waste of your rich coasts ' .	-7.1016
There was never a time when the ' elusive waste ' was better seen on our screens .	-4.0632
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.8238
This conflict because of the importance of statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : indeed , it is a conflict about the importance of America .	-4.1106
Lazarus - and their friends who campaigned to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act .	-5.0845
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a used classical visual representation .	-4.5233
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice .	-3.6931
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of the exiles .	-2.7579
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.7030
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .	-4.1848
The great horror of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for Trump ’ s coming , argued in 2010 that the statue of freedom does not invite anyone , but rather is an early neo-conservative , bringing the American flame into the world that has been transformed : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-7.4190
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.6844
The torch should not be paving the way for the United States . '	-5.3204
Limbaugh is hardly unusual here .	-4.2753
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception .	-4.0609
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , elder but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships .	-4.2389
It is really a question of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.6885
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and will they have to hear .	-3.0581
And that is not , of course , the prospect that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-3.3753
Their torch is not intended to illuminate the path , but to elicit the hatred that is its only source of power .	-4.7167
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK Team	-3.3928
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team .	-2.6754
The UK athletic performance director Neil Black says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championships will make a massive contribution to the team .	-4.9182
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.1537
Black believes that ' something special develops in Scotland ' and the UK 's athletics must learn from it .	-4.4400
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , " said Black .	-4.8013
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.6637
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.5518
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-2.3070
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.2632
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.7577
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain .	-4.8681
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.3058
Her captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.4950
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-3.2329
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great . '	-5.4683
The Commonwealth Silver medal winner , who will compete for the 400m hurdle in their fifth World Championships , says that it is " unbelievable " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.1701
Scotland ’ s best overall number of athletes at the World Cup was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.8362
The medium haul Muir is on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year .	-6.2020
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m tubes .	-3.9659
Chris O 'Hare , who is running 1,500 m , is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-5.0043
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scots in Team Lee McConnell was .	-4.1177
The team paper says that they are " enormously proud " of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team , but also in some cases in medals and finals .	-5.7531
" The special thing about being a team paper is that it was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me , makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-6.3938
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.3654
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.7565
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to podium .	-3.2475
What concerns my speech as a captain ?	-2.7635
Yes , I think it went well .	-1.2595
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .	-3.6215
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-4.7256
I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . '	-4.5891
Blocking critics on Facebook : Do not advertise you for a public office if you cannot stand up for voters ’ fueling .	-7.9575
The father of our country knew a little about bad press .	-2.6644
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .	-4.2144
He stepped in criticism , safe .	-4.3169
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.4181
In 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we shall be led like sheep to slaughter ' .	-4.6765
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.3093
Hogan ’ s employees blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-4.1911
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him early this week .	-3.3666
The governor 's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.4009
" It 's just Facebook , " said many people .	-2.1816
But it is important .	-0.8814
And it is particularly important if it is a type like hogan .	-2.9192
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular .	-2.5094
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.3404
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-1.1826
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles .	-4.1639
He was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters and debut his haarless head to Chemotherapy on his side .	-4.6827
That is why blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is called official and paid for by public taxpayers - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-6.7474
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor , arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-3.0377
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hasten people who swim online .	-3.9328
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-2.4033
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , not a troll .	-3.2488
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profane .	-1.7100
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-2.3511
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hated , but asked about hate crimes .	-2.8096
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the news " The Post " .	-3.7537
" I do not appreciate this idea either if a number of people take a position on the same subject , some people will disregard it as a so-called collective effort rather than a large group of citizens affected ' .	-6.4322
What the governor 's staff called " concentrated spam attack " would probably call others " intercession " .	-5.3163
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-3.2117
It is much cleaner than in the past if we had done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-4.8398
But that is precisely what is happening digitally .	-2.9338
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for accusing Facebook and other social media .	-6.5742
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-2.7103
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia .	-1.9819
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she hired a constituent from her Facebook page .	-4.3642
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .	-1.9176
This should not be so difficult .	-1.7643
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable porto had a similar effect to the Internet .	-4.0315
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter recorders swallowed his leadership .	-4.2582
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.4988
People who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-2.9905
Petitions , criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty , trade , and shipping with Britain , overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project .	-4.7794
But he did not silence them .	-2.2503
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse form the basis of our nation .	-2.0850
And true leadership means accepting it .	-1.3478
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club	-2.2801
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-4.0681
The Northern Ireland , which last year led alongside the Archerfield links to the final round before losing against Paul Eales , is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi .	-5.6602

" The players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition .	-3.1381
Jerry did a great job when he set this place .	-3.5135
He is a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here .	-4.6299
This is a great window of opportunity for this course . '	-2.7745
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career .	-4.4913

Gary Orr , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on the home floor .	-7.0951
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-1.6207
" It always means a little more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.6424
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .	-2.6587
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .	-1.9118
I am glad to see how it has gone . '	-3.7150
With the trio in the field , former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty .	-3.4568

Less lung cancer deaths by passive smoking	-2.7715
In the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.2915
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) will be present in a study .	-5.4033
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year , " said study manager Heiko Becher .	-4.1246
In comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .	-4.9320
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases in Germany due to passive smoking per year .	-3.5957
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-2.1002
Domestic connections are proving to be very .	-4.5689
The construction works in Villinger Straße are in full swing and " lie reasonably in time " , says the head of the Bauhofs Fred Heinze .	-4.8370
In the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , because there is much hidden underground , which is not included in the plans .	-6.5032
The traffic that keeps obstructing the construction work is a major problem for the Stumpp construction company .	-6.2218
" The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and locks is already enormous " , says Heinze .	-5.2318
The road is closed and only buses are entitled to pass through .	-5.4917
Angelo Caruso , Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks .	-2.0091

It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was incorporated in Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum , when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public handing over to the occupying forces .	-6.1857
An existing movement that incited independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government , which maintains control of the region , excluding foreign journalists or legal observers .	-7.4247

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.5664
But it is also Indonesia ’ s Goldland .	-2.3233
The world ’ s largest and most profitable gold mine , Grasberg , owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran , is only 60 miles from Paniai , a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.7633
In 2015 alone , Freeport dropped $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-2.1982
Moreover , Papua has estimated $ 78 billion in timber resources .	-3.2382
However , this wealth is a source of misery for the Papua , which ensures that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence .	-4.0628
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $ 20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-4.2004

" It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week , " says Andreas Harsono , Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch .	-3.3351
The screws have increased because Papua 's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .	-3.1353
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing , as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java , Borneo , Sumatra and Sulawesi .	-2.9975
Javanese Warung-Kantinen sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado , a mixed vegetable served with Erdnusssauce .	-4.3032
Local people are fighting to stay here .	-2.8967
" Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , " explains Abeth You , a 24-year-old Paniai native who went to work in the provincial capital Jayapura .	-4.0738
" It has cost the indigenous Papua - the Mama [ the women ] of Papua - their market . "	-3.3432
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo , known as Jokowi , promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .	-3.4938
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta .	-3.4229
But there has been little change in Papua , and today the locals feel cheated .	-3.9622
" Our hearts have been broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-3.5751
Indeed , only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October , Paniai suffered a low point .	-2.6898
On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through darkness on a motorcycle .	-3.7886

About 1,000 young Papua men , women , and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commando center to demand justice .	-4.4859
They carried out ceremonial hunting arches and led the Waita dance - in the circle and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm .	-5.6488
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts .	-3.3503
When the mood was heated , the soldier was sent a command over an internal spark : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " said TIME in an official document that was not released to the local media .	-5.7105
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto-quarter of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for calm and called on the crowd to return home .	-3.3339
Nobody was in the mood .	-1.9005
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left hand wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .	-4.2023
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .	-2.6380
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired " , he adds .	-1.9015
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times , his cousin , who witnessed the shooting .	-3.7375
" I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was " said Yohanes , who , like many Indonesians , only bears a name that TIME is bleak .	-5.3302
" I saw that he was dead ... I bought him . "	-2.8335
The chief inspector of the Papua police , Yotje Mende , said reporters that his officers only wanted to " secure " their station because they were attacked .	-3.7347
" We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-2.3746
" It is about life and death . "	-2.2529
According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured .	-1.8187
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only on the following day .	-3.2586
Three weeks , Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuses in Papua .	-4.5588
" I want this case to be resolved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , " he said .	-3.3825
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism for settling historical human rights violations .	-3.5653
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.1487
" Most injuries occurred a long time ago .	-1.8544
Some were in the 1990s and in the early 2000 's .	-2.5899
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , ' he said .	-3.8258
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.2928
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-2.5397
Wiranto , who accused the UN for ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled , including the Paniai incident .	-6.8911
Paniai victims ’ families received such claims with grim disbelief .	-4.0571
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.8549
'I am tired . '	-1.4882
He says that years later he still lives in fear .	-2.1132
" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.7003
" I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . " . . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.5732
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.8533
He says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .	-4.1436
" After burying the bodies , the military looked after me , " he says .	-3.5065
The shootings have not stopped .	-2.4709
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.5994

Regulated villagers protested before the company ’ s location office .	-5.4944
The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings .	-3.6561
But locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began shooting and killed a crowd .	-2.5768
" We were so panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and was witness to how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TIME .	-5.2192
'I have hid myself two days in my house ' .	-3.5130
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to account and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area .	-3.6520
Paniai has always been an unrest for the Indonesian Government .	-2.1969
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of tribal Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal living in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.1550
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by spurring sporadic attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers .	-7.0619
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.3093
In response , thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained under the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-3.5158
Some never appear again .	-1.7622
Among the people in Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-3.2008
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-0.8024
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.8255
Bread is just as beyond reach .	-2.0146
People here build everything they eat : above all , nota and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-4.2976
Agriculture is the task of women , who can each work on four or five pastries of the sweet potatoes .	-6.4772
They retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.8416
Ten items of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-4.5720
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived to Nabire airport since the opening of new routes .	-4.8021
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and prosperous migrants .	-4.1867
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills needed to make their own businesses competitive .	-3.6755
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money " , says John Gobai , Chairman of the Paniai tribal council .	-3.3094
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.8701
Moreover , restrictions on media coverage remain tense .	-2.3627
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.7600
According to Phelim Kine , the deputy Asia-Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jokowi ’ s election campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-5.2710
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's most troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-3.6263
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-3.2956
In March , six Pacific States - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai Foundry .	-3.4023
The same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.5519
The Speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the Group 's allegations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and there is free media , so it is difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-5.0321
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-2.0481
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , local silence and afflicted him " We want freedom " , according to a source who also participated in the session , but would like to remain anonymous .	-5.2449
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-2.6621
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai committees , " says Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council .	-4.5715
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .	-2.8794
Gobai says that the Paniai sailors , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jokowi as a " guilt " that he must repay .	-4.2355
" They don 't need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.5225
Despite the threats and intimidation , the Paniai victims ' families carried out a last symbolic act of consolation : the body of a victim was buried in an area close to the police and the military station .	-6.1542
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .	-4.0482
" A member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with a blessed head .	-3.4187
" What else can we do ? "	-1.6470
Fire capture the ' Torch ' skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time .	-2.8610
A fire took place on Friday in one of the world ’ s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high 79-storey building .	-4.4485
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years , which , incidentally , calls the Torch Tower ( torch tower ) .	-5.8838
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .	-7.4272
" We slept and we stood up for the fire alarm and the horrors of the people .	-5.3906
We ran down the staircase and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor " , a inhabitant told his name as George angab , Reuters .	-4.5986
Dubais civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00.00 GMT ) sparked fire and cooled the building .	-4.9914
The government said it is working on providing shelter for those affected .	-4.1860
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor high-rise buildings around the world .	-3.9490
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the clothing , exterior clothing to decoration or insulation .	-6.3514
In the United Kingdom , the police said that they believe that the system of plates to isolate and cover at the London Grenfeld tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .	-5.3689
No Davis Cup Reform : Continue best-of-five	-2.4722
The president of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has fallen through with his great Davis Cup Coup at the General Assembly .	-4.6368
At the Ho-Chi-Minh City session , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup-Individual was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-5.5419
Although it is often very long , it is precisely for this reason that the fifth class classics , which are very esteemed , remain in the traditional competition .	-10.0752
63.54 % of Member States voted in favour of reform , the ITF President David Haggerty ’ s aim was therefore scarcely missed .	-4.5037
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member states did not adopt the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup .	-5.2874
We need a change to safeguard the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-2.9257
We will continue to work to improve the evaluation .	-3.2247
It was not until the vote , after many objections , that the proposal had already been made to put the final in a neutral place .	-7.3128
New from 2018 are only comparatively small details : the finalists in the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup will have the right to host the next year in the first round .	-4.5510
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers , the requirements for training places etc. will be facilitated and the players will have to make less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-6.1790
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring prohibited items into the aircraft , a survey is published .	-5.7802
A survey conducted by air passengers revealed that more than 20 % deliberately or unconsciously banned items were smuggled by the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points , including at least 6 % that affected the aircraft while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades .	-7.3922
Less than 1 % claimed that they had been late discovered that they were wrong with firearms , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.2589
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules .	-5.0455
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something banned by TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % that were members of generation X .	-4.8978
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-4.0522
More than 3 % said that , knowing that the security checks carried objects with blades , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately taken banned drugs into the aircraft .	-7.6189
The company said it consulted travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods had been caused by airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .	-5.6039
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry smuggling goods - knowingly or ignorantly - through safety , were those who fly most frequently .	-5.5280
However , the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.5802
People are often insecure about what liquids they may take with them or how much of them .	-4.2285
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of items captured by TSA are prohibited .	-5.3190
For a while , the people who thought TSA could view books as smuggling goods .	-3.6972
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-2.0549
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order	-2.7449
Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla Model 3 .	-4.3294
In doing so , he has so far underlined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-5.7503
In addition to the ever-triumphal figures on turnover increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has , for the first time , betrayed another , less glamorous figure in announcing the recent quarterly balance sheet : the number of cancellations in the new mass market model 3 .	-7.5462
Musk has often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months , whose delivery is just beginning .	-5.6155
Musk now admits that 63,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn from the total number of 518..	-5.6910
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-2.6557
In case of a cancellation , Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) " Reservation Payment " .	-7.4773
Currently 455,000 such non-committal reservations were made , Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .	-4.8433
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling up to now around 12 percent of all orders could be made to the problem .	-5.5459
His argument is that the challenge to ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-3.7671
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.6995
2018 - all models are to be combined - 500,000 , 2020 a million .	-3.9074
Demand for this is obvious .	-1.8711
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-2.8672
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect delivery at least in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines tested in practice without any major interruption with maximum utilization .	-7.1609
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.5139
But if there are more delays , the non-binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-5.9254
After all , the company cannot prevent discontented customers from going away in droves .	-5.8743
EPA boss Pruitt is withdrawing because of the Obama Era ’ s reluctance to reduce emissions .	-4.4770
A day after he had been sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency , withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era ’ s rules to reduce emissions of smog pollutants .	-5.6022
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of public environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-4.2900
He did not mention the complaint raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal .	-4.4259
It is a deadline that ran for states on 1 October to meet the standards of 2015 for ground-level ozone .	-4.2670
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid " interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth " .	-4.1761
Pruitt , who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .	-3.4947
Since its arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the fossil-fuel industry .	-4.0851
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt ’ s regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.8802
Last month , a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-4.6329
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his U-turn in ozone standards would simply reinforce the EPA ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-4.8789
" Under previous administrations , the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be prosecuted by groups of activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " Pruitt said that the EPO has sued more than a dozen times in its previous job .	-6.8462
" We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-3.2113
We also take seriously the law and the authority we have . '	-2.6142
Nevertheless , the EPO 's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use its ' authority to delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on sound policy and the best available information ' .	-5.3054
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader revision of the ozone rules .	-2.8210
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.6660
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.5809
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that had sued EPA this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-4.2513
" The reversal of the EPO - after our complaints - is an important benefit for health and safety from these 6.7 million New York people and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-6.0429
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington and the District of Columbia .	-1.7263
Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources respond to sunlight in the atmosphere .	-3.2622
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in vulnerable groups of people , and every year it can contribute to thousands of premature deaths .	-4.5487
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered about Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-3.2900
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.3457
" We must continue to fight the ideological crusade of the Trump administration to engage in polluters and their particular interests . "	-4.5641

In 1267 , the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergisches Urkundenbuch : Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the remaining parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei " at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber .	-5.2739
The text of the document was written on the Tumlinger Berg , apart from the former parish church , also a ruling court , which belonged to the church or the patron saint , not the other way round .	-10.0288

Association wants to check the approval of windmills	-4.2946
" Boisheim defends itself " does not see any legal precondition for construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat .	-5.2882
The association " Boisheim wehrt sich " has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette .	-3.4391
It has been illegal .	-2.0802
The association argues that , at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette , wind turbines could not have been approved at all , as at the time of four , only a wind turbine zone existed at the city border at Schwalmtal .	-6.8631
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .	-6.1081
Such zones are designed to prevent the landscape from being " sealed " .	-7.1747
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by amending the land use plan , but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formal error .	-7.2890
" Due to the lack of planning requirements , the certificate of approval is still illegal and therefore to be withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , chairman of " Boisheim defends himself " .	-6.5160
The current state of affairs : before the summer recess , the City Council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; permission from the district government is still pending .	-6.7093
Erkens : " In this way , permission for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law " .	-6.8842
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.9907
" The corresponding letters have been received at the Viersen circle since last week " , a speaker explained .	-5.6380
The circle is taking it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-4.1354
However , they are unlikely to stop the procedure .	-3.7844
In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court , the circle did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the Boisheim Association .	-7.1447
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build a 4-200 metre-high windmills on an area on the Boisheimer Nette .	-5.4784
As early as last year , the company in which the city is indirectly involved had contracts with the owner of the approx . 65 hectares of land .	-7.1505
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to cover the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .	-5.9377
The NEW Re wants to invest some EUR 20 million .	-2.0045
Last summer , Viersens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich Windpark near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg district in Heinsberg .	-5.1157

In addition , local companies should present themselves with their training places .	-3.9399
In addition , the shops of the city centre should invite you to the " midnight shopping " .	-4.9105
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the nearer region .	-5.6606

In addition , customer potential should be re-opened or re-opened .	-3.9297
These include guests and tourists .	-2.8845

Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders were published by the Washington Post .	-3.0179
On January 27 , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , Trump called on him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.3473
The US President appealed to him because he publicly denounced the wall , and reportedly said to him : ' You cannot say that to the press ' .	-4.9900
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the US southern border , and vowed to pay Mexico for the project .	-4.0695
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.5561
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that trade would be " ridiculous " , " bad " and " stupid " for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia , and that the existence of trade conveyed by the Obama administration would make him look like a " depp " after proposing a ban on the relocation of refugees to the US .	-6.0444

Moores Ford-Massacre : Activists revive racist Lynchakt as a call for justice .	-3.2071
A 1948-er Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-5.1042
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way .	-3.2979

Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a reflection .	-4.2624
But if a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience enjoyed very real sigh .	-5.7936
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to emulate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.6878
Nobody has ever been accused of murdering .	-2.3491
" It is really inconceivable that , in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps organise posterity .	-5.3140
" It is a jewellery on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-3.2853
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights activists .	-3.6187
For him , posturing serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.7018

According to FBI files received by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of the Lynch process .	-3.3883
But none has ever been indicted .	-2.1309
Although the suspects have remained free for decades , citizens ’ lawmakers say that the double motivation for Lynch ’ s actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-5.2054
In April 1946 , the Supreme Court ’ s decision enabled black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer .	-4.0906
Roughly at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Malcom stacked a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman .	-8.7885
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had swallowed with Malcoms wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not born of her husband .	-5.2637
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , the FBI .	-2.8773
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.2219
But when she moved away from the prison and moved to Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynchmob moved the car .	-4.9254
" As it turns out , it was Harrison , who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes a FBI report .	-3.7240
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses " .	-4.6771
Brooks makes it even more concise .	-2.5148
" It was an electoral law massacre , " he said .	-2.1106
" They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you register and if you vote , you will pass it here . "	-4.4056
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual follow-up to Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde .	-3.0810
Her portrayal is vivid , touching and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in existence in America .	-6.8228
It is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that this is the point .	-4.0628
" We do not want to talk about the lynch because we are then confronted with the hardness of all of us , " she said .	-5.0695
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you don 't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done " .	-3.8830
The rehearsals for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - walked into a room and listened when Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece .	-7.3379
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director .	-2.1233
He has played the role of chief clan for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-3.6352
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-2.4049
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-2.9691
On the other hand , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.6108
The piece begins with Malcom , who shouts and afflicts him , angry that he has swallowed with his wife Dorothy .	-5.3845
" I said n --- he , disappearing from my property ! "	-2.1771
Rascona repairs the fire .	-2.1453
There is a break .	-0.8608
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-2.9724
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.6818
" What ? " , Rascona asked .	-1.6996
It is alarmed and confused .	-1.1407
Was I too harsh ?	-1.5248
" No , " Greene said , still kichernd .	-1.7959
" I simply do not believe that white people said ' n --- he ' .	-2.9838
" But " , one of the other black performers witched .	-3.7289
" You only have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-2.5781
And that is precisely where energy is shifting in space , a sense of comradeship replaces unease .	-4.5997
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-2.8493
The scene begins again .	-1.6029
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and emphatically .	-3.1535
Absolutely no one laughs .	-4.3723
This repetition ends violent and fast .	-2.3379
There are screams , shots and then silence .	-2.7178
A woman with a sorrow is above the bodies of the actors and interprets Billie Holidays ' mourning praise ' Strange Fruit ' .	-5.8543

The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-2.1692
A couple is from Ithaca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come just down the street .	-4.7458
They have all experienced Georgian moisture for nearly eight hours when Brooks leads them to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage trip .	-4.8507
Until this point , the murders have remained anecdotal , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels staggering .	-6.2193
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the surname .	-3.3047
Children hock on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whisper each other .	-5.4419
" They are not really dead " , a little boy murmurmurmurs as if he wanted to remember .	-4.6283
After a few minutes Greene thanked the crowd - and suddenly it 's over .	-2.0991
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wipe out their tears .	-2.5825

" What this really does do with me makes me believe that the Lynchen is still going on , " she added , " today the only police foundry is called . "	-6.0081

Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government in recent weeks , their policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani .	-4.1558
EPA reverses decision to delay the Smog Rule	-3.5970
The US Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay Obama ’ s administration ’ s regulation that states are obliged to curb smog-causing emissions a day after 15 states sue the Agency for the move .	-6.1406
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to press ahead with the so-called ' ozone provisions 2015 ' and said that it indicated the Agency 's commitment to work with states .	-5.2103
" We believe in the dialogue and in our response to our state partners , " said EPA boss Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-4.2789
In June Pruitt announced the EPO 's intention to measure the ozone provisions - in which emissions of pollutants are to be measured in part of the country in order to establish where cuts need to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018 .	-5.8812
A group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the Colombian district , complained on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-4.1586
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental concerns that former President Barack Obama has imposed as part of a broader agenda that Trump is supposed to boost economic growth .	-4.1826
But efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups that worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health .	-5.2027
The EPO website says that air intake containing ozone can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma .	-4.6745
Community council wants Community space	-3.2966
In the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two votes against , the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a Community area in the future senior residence .	-6.1455
Before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing part of the land is signed , the mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports .	-5.2770
Although it will still take to date the parish area in the municipal council , there is no planning barrier for the project to be stamped by a private investor .	-8.3923
There is a debate on a Community area .	-2.8834
One of the two investors still on the boat has offered to meet the community .	-3.4490
On the ground floor , it would provide a living area of about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .	-5.3529
The administration and majority of the municipal council envisage that such a community space should not be seen as a meeting place only for the residents of seniority living , but openly enter the community .	-8.4451
As an example , the word from the " Strickcafé " made the round .	-4.0415
The decision made last autumn by allocating funds to the current budget is not taken .	-6.7902
Construction is located in the rehabilitation area .	-3.4219
The establishment of a Community area would be , according to Tjaden , eligible for 60 % of 30 % .	-4.8215
The proposal for a decision , in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw a stick between the legs in this regard , stipulates that both sattel- - which is based on environmental construction - and powder roof - which reduces the grape height and makes the construction of economic power - would be possible .	-9.1892
Not only does Wilfried Sohmer think this addition is unnecessary .	-3.5214
If it helps , it will happen unanimously .	-4.8347
It is not so easy for the Community area .	-3.2941
Daniela 's reputation refers to the many own buildings with which one is not making the most progress , and for that we are now rejecting the Community space from the window , she says : ' I am struggling with it ' .	-9.7557
Yvonne Staiger is definitely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against communal participation .	-6.2958
It sees a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .	-4.0404
This is not the case , because the acquisition of the area does not give a subsidy , but gives a real value which can be marketed in case of doubt , is the counter-speech .	-8.5714
Staigers ’ request to split the proposal for a decision accordingly finds three supporters .	-5.2564
This is the case with two votes against the original programme , which Stefan Haller summarizes in such a way : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-6.3077
Collision with car : Radler is swept on road .	-5.5037
On Wednesday , an 82-year-old cyclist across the road was captured and badly injured by a car in Garath .	-5.7522
As the police said , the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on the road to Hilden by bike at 12.20 p.m. , and .	-6.9891
The senior wanted to cross the train at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch .	-3.5422
He gave priority to a passenger driving in the same direction .	-4.9013
When the Langenfelder took to the road , he obviously did not respect the traffic .	-7.5650
He joined a car that ran a 66-year-old assistant .	-4.6404
The man was taken to the street .	-2.4747
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospital with a rescue accident .	-4.2101
FC Bayern Munich must forego David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund .	-3.6680
The Supercup will take place without him : David Alaba must let the game take place against Dortmund .	-4.9987
The FC Bayern is the first mandatory match for the new season to Dortmund .	-5.6278
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner .	-5.1214
The German soccer recorder Bayern München will continue to increase its staff at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund before the Supercup on Saturday ( 8.30 p.m. / ZDF and Eurosport ) .	-7.3321
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also renounce David Alaba in the duel with the BVB .	-3.6634
The Italian confirmed on Friday .	-2.3226
In addition , Münchnern Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing .	-2.8807
Ancelotti has held responsible for the five defeats in the past six test games and the lack of balance in the game of his team .	-5.0901
" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-2.4729
Last but not least , it was good . '	-3.4428
However , the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official season .	-4.6982
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.3070
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .	-2.2026
The team is ready .	-0.7914
We want to play intelligently , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intensive game " .	-2.6627
The duel of the two German soccer weights attracts fans in their spell .	-4.9695
The match is sold out with 81,360 viewers , the German Football League ( DFL ) announced on Friday .	-4.3901
Hike to Star Harz	-5.2465
In the Harz , the first " Star Path " is to be created in Germany .	-5.6376
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans to .	-4.4439
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-3.0453
A " Star Path " meets the information needs of many Harzbesucher .	-6.2334
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.9604
The members want to set up along the planned route panels and inform about stars and constellations .	-5.8954
In a first phase up to 2018 , the association plans " well-attainable installations at five to six locations " in the Oberharz .	-4.9195
Infrage would be St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeiß and Sieber .	-3.5023
The information on the panels should be supplemented via the Internet .	-4.2829
For this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location .	-4.7578
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.2658
Later , the Sternenpfad Zug is to be extended by train .	-4.7197
" On the Star Path , the viewers learn a lot about the physics of the individual stars , " said the association .	-6.8024
They also learned why stars have different colors , or why a star is more luminous than another , though it is far further away .	-5.5624
It also mediates the constellation of a selected star and when it is best to see .	-5.9793
The association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014 , the highest observatory in northern Germany .	-4.1157
The location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany , according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation .	-3.6842
Often from there , the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen clearly .	-4.7221
Since 2003 , the Planetarium Göttingen has been operating on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen , similar to .	-8.0782
Beginning in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg , with its steels , leads to the Hainberg and the Sternwarte - as well as a " extraterrestrial " location in Diemarden ( community equals ) with the planet Sedna .	-6.1308
The steels with the individual planets - including the degraded pluto to to the end point - are set at exactly the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-6.0700
The earth shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 meters away , measures 70 centimeters .	-5.7104
The entire distance of the planetary route is about four kilometres .	-4.0741
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to stele with pluto .	-5.0883
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the world .	-4.5793
The march to the next fixed star would take half a year .	-3.4472
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown .	-1.7829
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing battle in the near future under £ 147 , met for the first time on Thursday .	-3.6627

" I am a former feather-weight , " reminded Garcia .	-3.3140
" I grew up in bronze [ to £ 140 ] , but I 'm not so big .	-4.0395
I am small for 140 .	-0.9025
I would like to get down to lightweight .	-2.3368
And he must move on lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.6094
That is what the fans are asking for .	-2.4048
Let us give them that ' .	-1.5652
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.6803
" Boxes need this fight . "	-2.3435
Climate asked if it should be on Pay-per-View , part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-Pfund-Debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) of interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight battle in the Forum on September 23 .	-5.0613
" This fight could take place in Pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it , " said Garcia , and later expressed themselves openly to fight on the network offering the best financial package .	-5.7129
We are the best .	-0.6408
No other name can generate this kind of attention .	-2.1201
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.3965
Garcia said that he regarded Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter " and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight .	-5.1916
But Lomachenko was thinking of the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think the tri-fight champion from Riverside looks " very slowly , I 'm sorry Mikey ... you want the co-out " .	-7.2342
Garcia said the focus is to show strength , then boxes .	-2.9928
Both said that they felt the momentum that built up for their own struggle .	-3.2532
" This is the battle that must be carried out .	-2.9520
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.6438
I am more than happy to work on this , " said Garcia .	-1.8862
Lomachenko said : ' I have waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.7091
It will be a great battle . '	-1.8838

Fortunas Hoffmann : " Dreierkette works better "	-2.1237
Andre Hoffmann hopes , after 2 : 2 , to start the season against Braunschweig , that optimizing the defense formation in Aue points .	-4.7645
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , and the result would not have been the two counterparts at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-5.1513
" These were two counterparts too much , and we need to be even more careful in Aue , " says Fortuna Düsseldorf 's defender .	-5.1934
In the Erzgebirge , the triangle should be further optimized .	-5.7482
And a gateway after a push , Fortunes no longer want to capture .	-6.5943
" For the future it will be the case that no one is aligning himself with Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-5.3183
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope with the three-string experience than with the four-string .	-5.9740
" I do not yet know how we will act in Aue " , says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , " because we have just in the tripartite on the semipositions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-6.0128
" The condition is that we harmonise even better and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction . "	-6.7225
Of course , Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game .	-2.6975
" But if you can talk about a failed start after a decision , don 't know .	-5.7991
The performance could well be okay , " Hoffmann said .	-3.5123
" If , however , we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the Cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start on the season . " , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.1998
His trainer did not want to know about this .	-3.4099
" The start in the season I only judge after six to eight days of the game , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of Saxony had to be terminated prematurely due to a storm .	-6.7430
" Now they can start the season almost with a home game , " Funkel and Hoffmann said that the players from Aue might even be a bit more fresh , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorites in the bones .	-7.3191
" But they don 't know so 100 % where they are currently " , says Fortuna 's interior defender .	-5.0081
It is true that the guests from the Rhineland are going to meet at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue on on Sunday .	-7.4753
" That we sweep them away simply because we have the right to come under the first six is stupid , " says Funkel , whose record is positive in defeat against Aue from nine games .	-6.1381
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you must beat from the outset " , explains Fortunas Chief coach .	-5.0354
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant " .	-2.8071
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday . , and .	-5.2116
New results of the Swedish Asylum Review	-2.2216
The recent results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new medical assessment method , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.9034
The Swedish authority for Forensische Medizin ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) has begun to carry out the tests last year .	-4.7367
During the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish migration authority ( migration sales ) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage .	-7.6165
To date , migration sales have sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31st July 2017 .	-6.8366
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.9843
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person ' may be under 18 ' .	-2.5838
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-4.3403
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .	-2.5785
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant " , he said the magazine The Local .	-3.6695
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age .	-3.8284
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that " suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older " .	-3.8954
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated the 581 published results , it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year .	-5.0655
The method of medical age assessment , the X-ray inspection of Weisheitszähnen and MRT recordings of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-6.2641
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later .	-4.0017
" I had reason to think about this , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.8106
Evaluating biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.6299
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend that we could do it , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-4.1137
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is low .	-3.7538
The greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 % . ' . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.8430
Full in Plan	-2.2067
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well .	-2.9311
On Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.9753
" We are very good at the time , it runs super " , says Reinhold Leicht , Bauleiter at the Department of Road and Transport in the Government Presidium Freiburg .	-4.6453
In April , the work started at the same time on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-4.4105
The end is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is adhered to .	-5.1556
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads over the Trombach .	-3.0541
It is a concrete vaulted arch bridge that is covered with red buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-5.0367
It was built in 1900 .	-1.5707
Like the other two bridges , it has come to the years .	-3.7027
In order to ensure durability and road safety , the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated .	-4.9905
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach .	-2.4595
They are made of red buntsandstein .	-2.4720
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 , or 10.60 meters long .	-2.8720
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now reached 1.30 metres wide and seven tonnes of the so-called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side .	-6.4651
This is a border fortification , which is also used as an operating route .	-4.6908
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 metres wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-5.4108
This is what the pedestrian path should be .	-5.4919
The special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo .	-3.8005
The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridges .	-5.3762
Particular sensitivity has required the creation of wires through the building in Lauterbach .	-5.8303
Because there is also a fibre optic cable which many companies are connected to .	-4.8673
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand papers .	-5.0671
In addition , fish and cancers had to be fished first .	-3.1631
For bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the saddle wine in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is regulated in one traffic light .	-6.1390
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " is fully locked .	-5.1046
The cost of the three bridges together amounts to EUR 700 000 .	-5.5814
It is financed by the country .	-2.7232
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protest in German potato alat	-1.8583

There is music and a lot of food , including a " urdeutscher Kartoffelsalat , which the AfD could eat easily " , says the woman who brought him .	-5.0369
The police ordered a lot of officials to Gerolstein , and it shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres from the venues .	-6.8252
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-1.9431
Mario Hompes reported from the AfD volcano board that he tried to do such an event and got the supplement .	-6.7392

So now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.1677
With a view to the event at Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.6152
This is also happening : around 8 p.m. on Rondellvorplatz a band for entertainment , in the city hall various speakers , including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge .	-6.1683
Some 200 listeners in the hall are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Weidel , and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch to make their speeches .	-6.2761
The police presence has not changed , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.5290
Some more than an hour the AfD event , the guests on the premises have a longer breath , but there too is scheduled to open shortly after 9 p.m.	-9.5095
The police can move away - no special incidents .	-3.5574

So Petkov Solotrompeter is the soloposaunist of the SWR Symphonieorchester at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli .	-3.6451
Both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .	-4.4777
Johann Sebastian Bach , for example , won a new Gewand , Daniel Schnyders " World Music " with Bulgarian folklore , and the " Exchange Suite " of the jazz singer Nils Wogram , mix classical , jazz and free games into a fascinating overall art .	-9.1433
This core piece of the program was premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .	-4.5462

Coe praises ' honest ' Russian excuse for doping scandal	-2.3550
The global leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised Thursday , which he described as an obvious excuse from Russia as a doping scandal , but repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be reinstated in sport .	-5.0236
Russia ’ s athletic leader , Dmitry Shylakhtin , said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World athletics championships that the ban on his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .	-4.3939
He said that he was sorry for " all athletes who were torn away in competitions for gold and silver medals " .	-5.5791
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-2.6945
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to reporters .	-2.3914
" The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned . "	-4.7192
Coe said he was also " pleased " that Russia accepted the criteria for his reintroduction .	-3.2000
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-establish Russia , " said Coe .	-3.7790
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation .	-3.1621
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the deceased system , " he added .	-2.9046

Trauerakt für in Mali abgestürzte Soldaten Soldaten	-2.1722
At a ceremony in Fritzlar in northern Hesse , approximately 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali have been commemorated .	-6.7054
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security precautions .	-3.5085
Defense Minister Ursula of the Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing about the unresolved crash .	-4.1508
She referred to the two pilots who had been killed , but as " experts of her profession " .	-7.9394
" We salute the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she said .	-4.9782
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from North hessen died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali .	-3.5083
Their sentences were transferred to Germany and were accompanied on Thursday by a German army guard in the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter .	-5.6618
At midday , only the members of the church took farewell .	-4.3254
After that , the ceremony began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics .	-4.7066
Hessen ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker were among those .	-6.2931
Sadly , roses laid down , the families stood in arms at the coffins .	-7.8762
In front of the church Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .	-2.9710
Secretary of Defense of the Leyen described the defeated soldiers as " highly decorated " and exchanged .	-6.1455
The Stabshauptmann built the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six Tiger pilots in his region .	-5.2704
Volker Bauersachs , commander of the Regiment , among which the soldiers belong , said : " If this occupation could not avert the crash , then it would not have been possible " .	-7.3503
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of Leyen : the stakes were dangerous .	-3.9828
But it is also very important for a country from which we are only separated by two states ' , she said .	-4.1780
After the funeral the coffins were taken out of the cathedral .	-4.3063
When and where they are buried , the Bundeswehr did not provide any information .	-3.7526
Prince Henrik does not want a grave beside his wife .	-2.2625
The Danish Queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-3.1450
The royal house was divided on Thursday .	-3.9286
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple is placed in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-4.0108
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already finished a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.3292
The queen agreed to her husband ’ s decision , it was further stated in the communication .	-5.2105
Where Prince Henrik is buried , it is still unclear .	-2.2150
However , he does not intend to be set aside in his French homeland .	-8.2610
Prince Henrik never made a statement that he was not happy with his title .	-3.0531
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .	-3.6834
In 2016 , he retired , including the title of Prince .	-5.4418
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief spokesman of the Danish Royal House .	-6.2063
Where the last retirement of the 83-year-old will ultimately be , it is still unclear .	-4.5315
However , he does not intend to be settled in his French home , but in Denmark .	-5.2734
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .	-2.6601
The native Henri de Laborde de de Monpezat , son of a French noble family , had met Margrethe in London in 1965 .	-2.6888
He worked on the subject in the French Embassy .	-3.0880
During his later wife , Prince Henrik had a difficult position in his barely 50-year reign at the Danes .	-6.7656
In a autobiography , Henrik spoke about the first years in Denmark : " A few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticized .	-6.0120
My Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of knitting socks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-2.9523
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals , I could not hope for forbearance .	-7.5952
I was different .	-0.6848
I appeared to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .	-4.6308

Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election	-2.3601
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.9232
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is in favour of a speedy re-election of land after the loss of the red-green majority , but does not want .	-6.3095
Because , on Friday , Parliament was in favour of the dissolution .	-4.4902
Previously , Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government plunged into a severe crisis , leaving a Green MEP in Lower Saxony ’ s rural .	-5.0895
Five months before the official date of the country election , the rot-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its narrow one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP .	-4.5028
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the election 2018 in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-4.9030
" I see my political future in the CDU " , she said on Friday in Hanover .	-2.4842
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his group accept them .	-3.6743
This would have CDU and FDP together with 69 seats in the Lower Saxony country day , SPD and Green 68 seats .	-5.7870
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-2.2104
The new country day will be elected on 14 January next year .	-4.9498
Thümler said that the rot-green government of the country must now decide whether it can govern without a majority in this situation .	-4.1401
Stephan Weil , however , believes it is essential that the day of land should decide on its self-resolution as soon as possible .	-7.0512
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is expected to decide on its on Tuesday .	-3.4782
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the country ’ s day will deprive the Prime Minister of confidence and elect a successor .	-5.6731
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.6289
These possibilities need to be checked legally ' , said Thümler .	-3.8804
'You will be discussing all the issues calmly when they are legally considered sensibly ' .	-7.3757
Thümler called Twestens Schritt " doch etwas kurios " .	-1.2117
The politician himself stressed : ' I am not a betrayal .	-3.7136
I feel very good .	-1.5645
She was an advocate of Black Green .	-4.2157
The Greens called for the breakaway MEPs to return their country 's mandate .	-4.4325
" We assume , of course , that she has given her country 's mandate through the Green National List , with immediate effect , " said President Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-6.6809
The Group chairman of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Anja Piel , said : ' We deplore the decision of Elke Twesten extraordinarily ' .	-3.8295
You have deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group .	-3.4348
'Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in substance , we cannot understand this step ' .	-4.8846
SPD chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal .	-3.6274
" The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters , but also betrayal of Red Green , " the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday .	-4.2405
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to quickly re-elect the country ’ s day .	-3.6275
Leave Twestens costs the majority of red green in Lower Saxony .	-3.9057
The politician places her wounded vanity and frustration in her personal interests before the welfare of the country , " criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil .	-4.9154
" It is scandalous that the CDU is involved in this dirty intrigue game in Lower Saxony and is trying to capitalise on it " .	-4.3616
Lower Saxony CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his fellow MEPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU .	-4.1528
The SPD group leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 election with personal care.	-4.5948

Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.5584
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.8432
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.4603
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.1971
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in the interview with the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-4.3441
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-2.0136
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and to check the stamp print .	-3.5354
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information about the Eier-Chargen affected .	-5.7224
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-2.1230
Even if , as we know at the moment , health risks are practically excluded .	-4.6314
Is Aldi now taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived by the German ?	-6.8322
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states .	-2.5945
Nevertheless , my House has moved on without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the acquaintance of Germany .	-6.3052
All information and risk assessment can be made available to consumers .	-2.4533
Trade , like the manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.9381
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded by eggs , they are not suitable for transport .	-4.5641
Unburdened eggs can be sold and consumed .	-5.9363
This time it is not businesses that are guilty .	-4.5082
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?	-3.0966
At present , production companies are not directly blamed .	-4.9011
On the contrary , they must expect economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies .	-4.7448
As always , there are too few controllers in the worst case .	-3.6403
Is it not a matter of staff or of coherent competence ?	-5.8037
It was the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.7546
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 % .	-3.0239
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to public prosecutors is of crucial importance in cases where criminal acts can be found .	-6.8904
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to be fully informed .	-3.9240
Is it really necessary to have regular alarms on food scandals ?	-3.8047
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and safe food .	-3.8212
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-3.5558
The money that has been earmarked is putting manufacturers , dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-6.1834
In principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of insecticides in the attitude of life-saving animals is unacceptable and must be brought to an end without .	-5.1780
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .	-3.3007
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are quickly and fully clarified .	-4.9879
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-2.5185
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending on European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s World Record Transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-4.2025
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA , because the leading organization that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions-League tournament .	-5.1406
Financial fair play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar ’ s transfer was financed without major losses .	-3.8330
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilians out of his contract , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several $ 10 million a year .	-6.0452
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France .	-1.9643
PSG can certainly loosen the money so that Neymar can sign it into a galaxy of other stars , given the team ’ s funding through the energy rich Qatar ruling family .	-6.3439
Clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must counteract legitimate sources of income that allow them to make the break-even point in their soccer business .	-6.1712
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as president of UEFA in 2007 .	-3.0801
Former French players believed that clubs that , in pursuit of success , had taken huge debts effectively deceived and risked ruining if banks or owners withdrew their support .	-5.7367
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentrating on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.0899
The change meant that the business model , which Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested vigorously to improve the team and build a global brand , should become a tougher matter .	-4.0138
During the current three-year FFP allocation period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-4.2613
And , while Platini fell in disgrace from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , remains committed to discouraging excessive spending .	-3.8276
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , opposite The Associated Press last week .	-3.2538
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum , it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract .	-4.2362
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the proceeds can be expelled at the annual accounts for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million .	-5.0078
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the PSG , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , has hit the most severe sanctions .	-4.1953
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .	-5.4054
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by inflating their revenue from companies linked to the owners of a club .	-5.2453
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not consider this legitimate income .	-4.5401
That is exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-3.2694
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made to Qatar by the World Cup organisational committee in 2022 .	-4.0473
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and that such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could simply be found out .	-4.8172
Previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to avoiding any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.3574
The UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG on Neymars Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.8134
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.4211
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million .	-4.0836
The accounts for the last fiscal year still have to be published .	-2.7928
PSG expects Neymars ’ arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising , and jersey sales .	-3.2601
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing .	-3.2589
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s withdrawal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-4.2043
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the president of the La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily newspaper AS in relation to catars ultimate ownership of PSG .	-3.9406
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports team , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .	-2.8418
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.3271
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.4623
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay , because different ways can be taken or different interests can be shared when a country has such a big player to represent a country . '	-6.2928
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggilier	-3.3682
In recent years Chocolat Frey Bord Chocolate has produced Swiss chocolate .	-3.1742
Now there is a possible end to the sweet cooperation : the airline rewrites the order .	-5.1955
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper " Nordwestschweiz " of Friday .	-3.7923
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.9388
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-3.6173
" With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied " , said the speaker .	-2.5320
Approximately 17 million small rotweiss packed shoggitafeln to 14 grams per year distribute the cabin crew to the passengers before landing .	-6.5060
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .	-4.7040
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to " Nordwestschweiz " to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros-Tochter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs .	-4.8449
But , more importantly , the advertising effect is all the more important : it is a prestigious order for a shopper manufacturer .	-5.8022
Like many applicants in the new tender , Swiss does not want to betray .	-3.7987
However , only Swiss manufacturers come into question .	-3.5349
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey seeks to renew the treaty beyond spring 2018 .	-2.8635
For sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-3.1914
Chocolate panels have been distributed on board flights since 2006 .	-3.7143
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter , Barry Callebaut had delivered chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug .	-3.5206
The possibility of placing the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.2489
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.1236
On long-haul flights , First Class customers will be pampered by Confiserie Sprüngli , in Business Class wet passengers Schoggi of Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey .	-4.8353
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also spread over the short distance , both in business and in Economy Class .	-5.2458

Nostalgia goes into " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " into the niche .	-2.3104
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90-year Grunge-era ( when the memory of David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch-Komödie " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things .	-7.4802
As a cultural artefact it is also a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-3.3029
But as a franchise , it feels like time is running out .	-3.7220
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a talking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-2.7748
By moving to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they managed to regain the last part of the joke .	-6.3776
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting principle , including a reef on the Stalin films of the 1990s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that the cradle " ) .	-6.1377
At one point , a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a series of other things from 1991 " .	-4.3492
Many of the central stories are the same .	-0.9917
The loving Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now novelist , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-2.8798
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.5152
And there is another crazy plot in which Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) is involved , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-4.6493
As always , the courses are the best part of the franchise .	-2.7458
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillon 's underlip bar of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old crack .	-5.4644
They are the moments of random madness that this franchise could fuel like a repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the bands how they will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-5.8957
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even of " GLOW " with its East-West ring-fight iconography .	-4.6301
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , with Rhys Thomas as a director , is to be a captured TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers as friends , two officers from Bucharest who are fighting for truth , atheism and the way of Marxism Leninism .	-6.0054
The main roles - a hard saturated Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues of Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English .	-3.9142
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.4932
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.6388
There are some nice gags to the image ( the police spend time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .	-6.1401
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game ' Find out ' .	-2.8574
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer carrying a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single .	-3.7576
With six long episodes , it moves away , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-4.4770
" Comrade Detective " , which was redirected to a lesser length , could better deliver its agitprop string , as Gregor and Iosef regularly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of Hamburg .	-6.5106
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for a celebration .	-5.6140
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even make it with our own recent history and with theirs .	-3.7355

At the same time , two people were arrested in Italy .	-2.7187
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects .	-2.0731
The two will probably be delivered to Germany .	-3.0821
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-5.3706
In total , more than 300 police officers were in .	-3.8014
Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder and robbery and blackmail .	-3.9900
Since the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office of Konstanz has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-4.4148
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-3.7497
Therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large-scale deployment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .	-5.4932
Ins Visier of the investigations , mainly Italian nationals with close reference to the Italian mafia .	-6.1966
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the account of the bands .	-4.9799
How many gaps in the Foreign Register	-4.8789
" Data from citizens who should not appear there " : according to a report , the foreign register in Germany has serious shortcomings .	-4.8952
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-3.5731
According to a media report , the Federal Government 's representative for refugee management , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the foreign central-register .	-6.9814
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to some serious misjudgments in asylum procedures and deportations , " warned in an analysis presented by the " Süddeutsche Zeitung " .	-6.3093
According to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are covered , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.0486
The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.1107
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality has not been good in parts .	-4.1732
In individual cases , data was found in 1921 , " of people who have long ceased to live , or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register " .	-5.7329
" Bug data input can slow back processes considerably , " says the report .	-4.7135
Moreover , the statistics on expatriate people include EU citizens who would not have to leave .	-5.1895
However , such false allocations led to a distorted debate on how to deal with those who are travelling out , so it is said in the analysis .	-7.9099
Meanwhile , the federal government seems to have begun sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 years of age when they have arrived there .	-5.1052
This emerges from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-6.0242
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is conducting such procedures for families with children , except for babies and small children , to Italy since 1 June 2017 .	-6.9122
Since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually impossible , as the newspaper pointed to the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.9405
Under the Dublin agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for achieving them first .	-4.6810
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can send him back to the country of entry .	-4.0054
In order to justify this , the office is now writing : ' Meanwhile , the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased substantially ' .	-6.1427
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.5500
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments sufficient .	-2.4693
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement .	-3.1820
The domestic spokesperson in the left-wing faction in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticized this decision : " Families with children are threatened with human rights abuses in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare " .	-5.9375
The second result achieved	-4.0320
A total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Oberreichenbach already provided blood donation service to other people .	-4.5195
At least of the 12 citizens who were awarded Friday .	-5.0904
Jürgen Greule , who , with his now 100 donations , now shared 50 liters of blood .	-5.7526
Traditionally , the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood at the meeting of the municipal council .	-5.2532
" It is genial how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood to strangers , even to this , " underscored mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.6234
" A single blood donation helps several people " , explained the circle preparer of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the canned are broken into their constituents .	-6.1701
Three people could benefit from blood donation .	-4.0700
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported on the actions taken in the spring in Oberreichenbach .	-4.9600
" This year , with 114 donors , we achieved the second best result , " said the DRC councillor .	-4.6256
Obviously , the changeover to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants .	-4.1390
Even before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were counted among the multiple donors and received 50 blood donations .	-8.9609
Half as many were booked Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spent ten times per 500 milliliters of their life saft .	-4.1857
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %	-0.8640
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation slowed speculation about an increase .	-4.9416
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it included interest rates on family income in the midst of increased pressure .	-4.1999
Monetary Committee ’ s policymakers ( MPC ) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 % , with fewer members rising this month , as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase .	-5.2211
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % for 2018 , warning that fiscal pressure would continue , with inflation expected to rise to close to 3 % in the fall .	-4.4528
But they signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to rein in inflation fueled by Brexit , and they said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.2808
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-3.4144
It will demand time for the financing plan to allocate cheaper funds to banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more within the framework of this system - GBP 115 billion .	-5.6993
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the central forecast of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption . "	-5.2935
At interest rates , she repeated that " a certain tightening of monetary policy " would be needed to cool inflation and a " slightly larger " scale than the markets expect .	-4.9658
Markets are predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.6357
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-2.7337
The Bank ’ s downward revised growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .	-3.8337
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.0686
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro .	-2.7425
The pound fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .	-1.8441
The decision not to change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest-rate hike , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .	-4.7822
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the bank ends of the year .	-4.3737
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage increases , because tightening will get worse first before it gets better .	-5.3896
It added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " income collapse in the coming years , " but it added that wages will recover significantly at the end of its three-year forecast .	-4.8882
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate part of lower consumer spending .	-3.2976
The decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound ’ s sinking .	-3.6980
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for prices and the economy to be fully achieved .	-3.1446
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an interest-rate hike increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-4.4593
Inflation has fallen from 2.9 % last month to 2.6 % in June , even though the bank said that this was expected and that it will rebound in the coming months .	-4.9357
The Bank said that the overshoot in relation to its 2 % target was ' entirely ' to the weak pound .	-5.2249
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders are loudly looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way .	-4.9278
The market looks particularly good for those who end the existing deals and end the new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . '	-6.7135
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people .	-3.8959
Patients will receive HIV prevention treatment as of September after a fight before the High Court against drug financing in the NHS .	-4.9664
NHS England announced that a pre-sex preexposition prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people .	-6.9007
He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .	-4.5236
The chess announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a " decisive moment " .	-4.7306
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.8720
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.1434
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious agents .	-2.7972
Taking pre-sex PrEP means that just enough drugs are available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .	-6.3339
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-3.6115
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.4679
In clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.8835
People who live in England and are registered with a domestic doctor can also register for possible participation in their local sex clinic .	-4.7622
The programme will sign £ 10 million and NHS England a contract to supply medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .	-3.6900
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.5683
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.5945
It is another milestone in which more than three decades of ongoing progress in tackling one of humanity 's greatest health challenges . "	-5.2481
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.3178
PrEP , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.3600
From September to September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which will improve many , many lives .	-5.1755
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.8479
Ian Green , CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-4.4770
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-5.9436
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Health Minister , said : ' The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delays in implementation by the government .	-3.6524
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.1672
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-2.1691
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will help us to move closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.6926
The big life : the mezzanine floor and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-4.8328
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , fell in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment .	-3.0279
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-2.8593
" Before that I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room " , says Joanne .	-3.0856
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .	-4.5415
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.5946
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . '	-2.6477
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely outdated .	-4.1689
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauraum and a mezzanine to make the most of the spacious ceiling .	-5.5391
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light .	-1.8278
That was my request , ' she says .	-2.4226
To this end , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill , who used 12.5 feet high ceilings to create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.9206
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .	-5.0383
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-2.0790
" The steel mill is quite complicated " , he explains .	-2.5312
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they had to be stacked together without us having to join .	-5.7150
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of creating steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-4.3330
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .	-4.7046
For the mezzanine , a classic copper window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area .	-4.7453
mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.3451
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-2.2524
On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer .	-3.7830
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.7561
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-4.7534
By perceiving a glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-4.0108
Closed kitchens are nothing new .	-3.6022
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.5094
" A bit of engineering went into it " , explains Erfan of the steel , furnized MDF door .	-5.5404
" It is counterweight , so if you push the door up , it is very easy to sli. . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.6911
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne gained an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.1809
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued " , says Erfan .	-3.2534
" In a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the floor " .	-4.2568
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .	-5.6256
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.3841
" You don 't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls .	-3.8653
They are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.2830
It shows that a flat can turn into something quite amazing by good design and increased square meters of slightly standard .	-5.6695
Indeed , as Joanne , you could decide not to leave .	-2.3048
Brothers are fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire	-4.3347
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute about one of Victorias ’ largest property imperials worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.2376
The former director of the ' Carlton football club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared .	-4.5795
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute about separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-4.5757
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-3.6580
There , the Westco Jeans family founded a chain of 160 retail stores .	-4.7926
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.7062
This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburb .	-4.3278
According to an agreement with her deceased father , Colin - described by Paul as " main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of corporate wealth and Paul about one-third .	-4.9389
A court act states that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-3.2400
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.6232
" The departments proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit .	-3.4949
Last Friday , after several failed mediations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.4681
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled out .	-5.7585
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of managing some ownership incompetent .	-3.1003
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-3.3559
" My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.4551
The costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages of Affidavits , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held on both sides .	-4.4437
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought dairy and delicacy shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-4.2109
They used the security to buy the Collingwood land in which Colin opened the family ’ s first jeans shop .	-4.6698
Colin says that he began Westco there when he was " in my last years the High School when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-4.4271
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons .	-2.6964
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court " , she wrote .	-2.3289
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke $ 26 million .	-3.1297
Both Lukas and Mark have become embittered , says Paul " on the terms of their financial separation " .	-4.8828
Colin was very restrained , although he was a former member of the AFL board and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star .	-4.7569
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.9055
Only Colin responded by SMS to say ' I really cannot say much ' because the case is before the courts .	-3.5683
" It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-3.2281
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.5088
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.6262
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.8607
" Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts , " wrote Colin .	-2.2618
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to curtail the president ’ s media aversion .	-3.3397
Others have tried and failed .	-1.1215
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .	-1.9678
If so , he will be the first .	-1.4018
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even-handed course .	-4.6060
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.4912
" When John F. Kelly , the White House Chief of Staff , met with senior officials on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information coming into the hands of the president .	-4.9037
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he had received good information . '	-3.8528
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.6576
President Trump ’ s relationship with television dates back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.4939
" When candidate Trump was angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of posts to convince , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .	-5.2028
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a steady praise . "	-3.8519
Okay .	-0.6253
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been under control is ridiculous .	-2.2244
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions .	-4.1495
We will probably never hear anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.6562
If his staff managed to keep him out of trouble a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile .	-5.9705
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-2.5722
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.5549
Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to give the President questionable information for strategic reasons .	-5.2855
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.3539
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuttings , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he understands where they come from .	-5.7331
This was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson , accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a pile of leaks " in the White House .	-5.0388
Though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or offered no concrete evidence , or that he had reproached and revoked false allegations in the past .	-5.7763
Trump read the article and began to question Walsh staff . "	-3.6159
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram Trump receives .	-3.2321
How did that work ?	-1.5094
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-1.7034
Perhaps he will prove himself a more effective manager than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulse self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-3.8836
These unchanged factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.1330
Most sought after criminals receive mail from Europol	-3.3852
Since the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped for .	-4.1564
Police across Europe are sending out ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals this summer .	-3.0152
Since the addresses of the sword-criminals are naturally not known , indications from the population are hoped and requested .	-7.8417
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the ' EU Most Wanted ' calendar of winter .	-3.5570
The experience would have shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations , Europol said .	-6.0064
21 postcards have been compiled for searched criminals from 21 EU countries .	-3.1128
Since 2016 , the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .	-2.9978

Travellers negotiate a grave and return to the ' Millionaire ' series .	-4.0001
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travellers at the war foot , who negotiated a tomb drawn by the community to call back a field in front of their manor houses .	-7.4153
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull called the " Millionaire series " .	-3.9135
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters , after they were thrown out only in May , but without being deterred by a burial excavated by the Council to prevent their occurrences .	-6.1011
The tactful group found a gap in defence equipment and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-4.3898
Outraging residents have afflicted the advice of Solihull , who said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.1888
An anonymous inhabitant said : ' They went there on Monday evening after being sent back by Bentley Heath , where they thrown stones onto the passersby .	-5.7256
The Council must be forced into practice by Scham , because it was useless when dealing with the problem .	-4.1536
Travellers were there in May , moved forward and are now back .	-4.1022
More came yesterday evening , probably even more today . '	-2.5266
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks .	-4.6573
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-2.7111
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said : ' It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers to be plundered by another round .	-4.5618
The figures have increased this time and have even seen a horse in the parking area ' .	-3.8509
A spokesperson in the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls .	-5.7363
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .	-3.4089
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . '	-4.0114

The former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise .	-3.0070
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is being renovated and is to be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.6829
These are good news for the city .	-1.5250
After all , with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH , about 30 000 overnight stays were lost at the time of 13 April 2014 and revenue from the spa tax .	-6.8829
In the autumn of 2014 , the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation , given dramatically rising numbers of refugees who came to the county county , causing controversial discussions .	-8.0001
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-5.0837
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the council .	-3.7627
But , above all , Freudenstadt ’ s mayor , Julian Osswald , defended the hotel ’ s location and talked about serious interests at the time .	-5.3746
He should be right .	-2.4002
The Luisenhotels Group , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it into a three-star hotel named Waldhotel Luise .	-5.4820
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object .	-2.2278
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.2158
Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.9682
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it is clear what extensive renovations are being carried out .	-7.2372
The floors were torn out , blankets were partially dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-5.4578
The entire hotel building is a single building site .	-2.6179
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.8606
" It is actually a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-3.2647
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.8645
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned , new windows are installed .	-4.1382
Everything should be " beautiful citizen-close " later , as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-5.6285
" We want to make a jewel on the outside " .	-3.4000
Swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are included in the facilities . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.0309
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad , but already at an elevated inner city level , Scherer emphasizes .	-5.8248
The Waldhotel Luise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set up a wide range , explains Scherer .	-5.8168
Both individual holidaymakers , groups or businessmen should feel at ease in the hotel .	-4.1512
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause , so Scherer . , and . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.2488
The city 's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .	-4.4747
" We are on the same line . "	-1.6717
After the amount of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to define himself exactly .	-4.8093
He expects just under EUR 1 million .	-4.0651
The exterior systems are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .	-6.2337
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible by the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-5.0452
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.1481
Russland-Affaires : US Special Adviser sets a Grand Jury	-5.4377
In US President Donald Trump ’ s case of Russia , special counsel Robert Mueller is to have appointed a Grand Jury after a report .	-5.6178
The panel has begun work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " , invoking trusted individuals .	-5.9891
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations .	-3.6979
The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already initial invitations from the board in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-4.8313
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-3.3920
Mueller investigates whether there was agreement between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-2.6310
The investigation should focus on several men who acted as a Republican adviser in the election campaign .	-4.9592
According to reports , Mueller also looked at more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.5766
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Trump ’ s Special Envoy personally focused on investigating whether the president may have hindered justice in the course of the affair .	-5.8717
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether to charge charges .	-4.5681
Grand Jurys are therefore also called prosecutors .	-3.2825
In most cases , they are switched on when they are larger and controversial .	-4.2704
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .	-1.7191
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to pre-empt people for interrogation .	-5.0094
According to CNN , preliminary invitations have already been issued , turning around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.7445
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , the report said .	-5.0844
They should also provide documents .	-1.3305
In addition to Trump ’ s Jr. , Trump ’ s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner , as well as his former campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were also involved in the conversation .	-5.4784
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the establishment shows that Mueller is not intimidating in his work and that , if necessary , he wants to act quickly .	-5.4743
However , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge .	-5.7223
Nevertheless , the appointment of the body to begin a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-5.2024
In the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-5.1580
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-2.3644
The issue gives the democrats a chance to ' feel good because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-4.0275
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.7103
But they usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-4.3940
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Envoy in a fair manner .	-4.1947
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not determined against the president .	-3.6348
There is no reason to believe that something has changed , the explanation went on .	-5.2594
But Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey .	-2.7547
Because of this robbery , accusations against Trump had become louder , he wanted to obstruct the judiciary .	-5.7847
Comey told a Senate Committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.9701
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.0925
According to US media , the White House collected material against the special broker and his staff .	-4.7273
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller .	-2.8458
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Councillor , such as in the Watergate affair , Mueller has a position in which , in theory , he could be fired by the Justice Department at the instigation of the president .	-5.5373
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.9110
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday , according to which the special counsel could no longer be made redundant .	-5.7212
Antarctica : Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica	-2.5274
In the West Antarctica , a gigantic iceberg of Berlin ’ s barely seven-fold size has been solved by Schelfeis .	-5.3795
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research was announced on Wednesday .	-4.3892
The colossus , which weighs more than a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres , is now going to north and will probably need two , three years until it is melted .	-6.0563
It is one of the largest ice giants in the last three decades with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres .	-4.9226
It does not pose a threat to people .	-3.7156
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear in the light of research .	-4.4597
In total , however , for about 30 years , there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice cuffs in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-5.4193
Many researchers believe that this could be linked to global warming .	-2.7501
The now broken Koloss has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-4.2943
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.7264
As a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .	-5.5363
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.6699
North of this slap , the balance of guards and breaks was disturbed a few years ago .	-6.1317
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete slap .	-3.6733
There is some point in favour of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis being put in jeopardy , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now .	-7.7402
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and can fall apart if a key spot breaks down .	-6.3637
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level because they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it does after melting itself .	-4.8339
However , the loss of the skull leads to the glacier coming directly into the sea and being able to flow much faster than before .	-6.4755
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-4.6865
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis , according to AWI data , is the fourth largest skeleton of Antarctica , with almost 50 000 .	-5.2944
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge of the free ocean about 200 meters .	-4.3016
It breaks down regularly .	-3.2461
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sheet now comes into a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary from the British Swansea University .	-7.4407
" This is the widest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-4.0792
Among scientists , whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said , adding : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-5.6119
But this development will take decades .	-1.5482
Even if these researchers do not return to climate change to the demolition of this gigantic iceberg , many iceberg of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .	-6.4208
This long neck of the Antarctic stretches towards South America .	-3.3788
According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey , the Antarctic Peninsula 's ice surface has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.8577
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-3.3576
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years , making it one of the areas where temperature is the fastest .	-4.8564
CDU wants domestic tariffs for staff	-4.5321
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vacant positions , the CDU is asking the employers ' association to resign in order to become more attractive .	-5.1132
Only just before the summer break , the roundabout has woken up 41 new administrative posts .	-6.8006
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.8465
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind .	-4.6174
Teachers at the circle are obviously very desired .	-5.0273
Approximately 620 applications have been recorded for places to be placed this year .	-4.5806
However , the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .	-5.5059
Currently there are still 50 vacancies in Mettmann circle .	-4.2437
Among other things , doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces are invited .	-5.0803
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and confront the shortage of skilled workers in administration .	-4.9409
According to the request of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for the recruitment and personnel development .	-7.5661
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals , but to counteract the shortage of candidates for the future .	-5.1650
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , identify concrete measures for cross-frontier entrants and include a training offensive , call for CDU , FDP and UWG .	-5.3055
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.6982
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not previously known .	-5.2335
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-1.7014
There is talk of a real ' competition between public employers ' .	-3.5152
In addition , a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age are excluded .	-6.5303
So it is time to act so that there are no more jobs left .	-6.1917
But Klaus-Dieter Völker , leader of the CDU group , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.8517
He recently offered a faustdick surprise when he publicly questioned the staff cost cap and hiked the other parties .	-7.3356
People want all possible ways to be reviewed to allow a withdrawal from the local employers ' association .	-6.3688
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - should aim for a domestic tariff , " says people .	-8.0259
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff .	-5.5425
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level that is oriented to professional years .	-6.8586
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .	-4.6147
Only a few weeks ago new premises had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on prostitutes .	-4.6928
Last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-3.8975
Italy is tightening the tone of NGO migrant bailouts	-3.1192
Italy has warned NGOs that the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean should not continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations .	-6.1644
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turiner Tageszeitung La Stampa .	-3.6498
Minniti 's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation ' Jugend Rettet ' , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in ways that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.8555
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to give its opinion on detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor , Ambrogio Cartosio .	-5.0600
" For us , and will continue to be our top priority to save human life , so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-6.1986
" We can only judge all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can judge the situation . "	-4.8235
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Save ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.3601
It is presumed that his crew will take on board slurry migrants delivered directly to them by traffickers , and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be used again .	-7.7127
At least such a meeting took place allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Public Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .	-4.5995
The crew is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motive .	-4.4450
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities .	-3.5882
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to keep to the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain . , the , , and . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.8533
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable , because they would not introduce ' substantial changes or obstacles ' to their rescue operations .	-4.5183
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.6073
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libya ’ s coastguard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.8920
" In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.7811
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-3.2089
Anstiege and Trials	-2.5233
Neun Weilermer Biker , the " Berliner Außenposten " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy Trials and sights for four days .	-3.4485
Three friendly guides were available for this .	-3.2959
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-4.9618
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition .	-3.0052
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim .	-2.9111
It was followed by lookout points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the woods and the above plains .	-8.4049
In between , there have always been longer increases , for which long trials have been rewarded .	-5.7139
The second day was followed by Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-3.9830
Again , lookout point at lookout point , connected by " flowige " trials and moderate increases .	-5.3019
On the last two days , many meters of altitude were again scheduled .	-5.3403
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shopping huts brought welcome breaks .	-2.2835
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers breathe saline sole in the open-air inhalatory .	-5.8616
Neustadt was also taxed .	-3.0176
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .	-5.0943
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sports	-4.0301
Are the sports stars going to fight against computer consoles in the future , instead of being fucked by wind and weather over ?	-8.1288
The fact is that e-sports has long since become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high margins including .	-4.9439
This has also recognised the first Bundesliga averages , which are increasingly involved in this area .	-4.8736
At the beginning of 2015 , VfL Wolfsburg , later FC Schalke 04 followed , and last but not least the VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and incorporated two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .	-6.3412
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB " , says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.9736
He is sure " that there are still a number of clubs on this train " .	-5.7068
This weekend , the FIFA World Cup Football Federation in London is organising the first Interactive Club World Cup , where the gamers of different clubs compete .	-7.0255
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-2.4352
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-2.0818
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players .	-3.1757
" Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year-olds in particular , that young people are still going to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-6.8059
And : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially Asian ones .	-3.1878
With prominent E-sportsmen under contract , you could be present online much more often in these markets than just sending the Bundesligamannschaft to Asia once a year .	-5.6141
What exactly is this about ?	-2.2446
In e-sports , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or even FIFA football simulation at competitive level are fought out .	-5.1796
As in normal sport , leagues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .	-4.1883
And with Asienspielen 2022 , E-Sport is already part of the official program .	-3.3848
But is this a real sport at all ?	-3.3481
For many , the idea is certainly needed .	-4.0314
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time .	-3.0656
For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions which are also found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.2183
It also requires cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and rapid response capability .	-3.8410
Professional gamers should not only train at the console , but also train their bodies and take care of nutrition .	-3.6993
" The fitte player is a good player . "	-1.3941
Froböse also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-3.5646
Controls are difficult to implement in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport lacked .	-4.8532
On the positive side , the scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports .	-4.9394
Players are travelling internationally , as a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.8877
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth in e-sport .	-5.2859
In 2016 , Germany implemented EUR 50 million , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and large tournaments .	-3.9000
In three years , sales will be 130 million .	-3.4758
It is little against the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the football league .	-6.0887
However , e-sports is no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , the Deloitte consultants write .	-4.8632
Many countries are already international .	-2.9455
Big markets are Asia and the US , where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in US Team NRG eSports .	-3.3786
Hollywood-Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn .	-2.2870
There are also things that are happening in Europe .	-3.5239
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a subject of teaching , Froböse says .	-3.7642
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , the football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sport department .	-3.9938
" In the European comparison , Germany is lagging behind , " explains VfB 's Executive Board Röttgermann .	-4.4742
It is only in nostalgia to fall , and the old times are no longer enough .	-5.3800
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to orient the company on the modern market .	-4.2513
" We live in a digitized world " , says Dutt .	-2.0724
" It is not possible to say that only football will keep everything as it has always been . "	-7.1940
Gift-Eier ade - Ei alternatives to cooking and baking	-5.5161
The scandal of toxic eggs has now affected almost all the federal states .	-4.5131
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and have taken all eggs out of sale throughout Germany .	-3.5388
In the shelves , only eggs are to be taken which are demonstrably not containing a fipronil .	-7.4485
Michelle Carter condemns Conrad Roy for suicide for the texts .	-4.0018
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .	-2.9669
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation .	-3.1194
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .	-3.5181
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : ' My family is unspeakable .	-3.7291
My son was my best friend . '	-0.9537
Carter was allowed to remain vacant until he was appointed .	-3.5439
She was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered a mental illness .	-3.4692
In red trousers and a cream coloured blouse , Carter stood in the eyes with tears , with folded hands and down when convicted .	-7.8602
" Your actions have killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor in the court .	-2.8099
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-2.0501
She did not take responsibility ' , she said .	-2.9939
" She has shown no repentance " .	-2.7725
But Carter 's lawyer said that it is a ' terrible circumstance that she utterly deplores ' .	-4.4048
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , he did not find out that their " age or maturity , or even their mental illness , have a significant influence on their actions " .	-3.7479
A Public Prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy , saying that there is ' no day on which I do not entrust the loss of my beloved son .	-4.9018
I would like him to be proud of me and , as I do , I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we will bear for eternity .	-8.6492
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would be " persecuted " by knowing that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children .	-4.3795
" Having no longer this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-5.0996
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-3.1092
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.3352
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-3.5613
" Hang on , spring from a building , first you yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family .	-5.0829
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : " You must do it , Conrad " and " Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . "	-4.1206
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from the case by any press .	-3.5980
The case has divided legal opinion .	-2.3547
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was convicted of murders in Italy in 2007 , before being freed two years ago .	-4.2696
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-2.8587
Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the new Mini-Lahm of FC Bayern	-2.5647
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .	-3.9041
FC Bayern mourns the Confed-Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not harm .	-4.6301
Something was different in his seat in the cabin , which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately , even though the additional garment was very , very small .	-4.0744
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups , of course , no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer was seen , he made the binde allocated to him stop the arm .	-9.6568
" The trainer did not announce it " , the Confed-Cup winner told after his first bet as a Bayern-Kapitän .	-5.2233
Good , the one could have run better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-4.0656
But the sign of Coach could also interpret Kimmich .	-3.4402
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as the leader of the C-Elf as the player of youth players , debutants and especially from the holiday .	-8.2262
Sugar is best distributed to those who have a lot of confidence that you want to keep at your mood .	-9.0120
So if you ’ ve been able to explore the legacy of Lahm , a little extra motivation can only be used well .	-7.8674
Kimmich confirmed : " That is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-3.7503
On Wednesday the 22-year-old was flying over the field as a mini-lahm .	-4.1973
Right at the back , this is now his position , the white link at the arm did its rest .	-5.1704
And even Kimmich worked in this startup formation as the one who can best take the ruder into his hand .	-7.0243
He gave instructions , tried to steer the unrecorded force .	-4.0737
He had a look at the whole thing , while many others were concerned with himself .	-4.6591
Vidal thus overplaying his missing fitness ( scarcely folded ) ; Renato Sanches so that he could join the achievements of the Asian journey ( even limited ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot no negative .	-9.3770
That was all very well .	-3.9220
Süle ran next to Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acted sovereign .	-3.5708
The famous Napoli storm was often difficult , and additionally tried to succeed in building the game a few times .	-8.3100
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped ' .	-3.4247
But he also showed a decent performance in debut .	-3.7937
Publishing of games , change of tempo : " For this style I was also fetched " .	-5.7969
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the newcomers , it was seen after the game .	-7.1608
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two in the catacombs , but determined six or seven interviews .	-3.3991
After a few tough statements in the back of his new players , Kimmich passed away .	-5.9988
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is going on here , I have already noticed .	-5.5660
In Bavaria you simply have to win any game " .	-3.4634
After all , he no longer has to teach the new .	-3.5314
Alaba motivates ÖFB-Ladies	-2.2867
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies	-2.6733
Austria ’ s most famous soccer player reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wanted the Austrian Austrian ÖFB ladies well .	-8.6084
The Bayern-Legionär is a club collegue of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our ladys .	-5.5839
The Tweet of the Austrian soccer player of the year and Champions-League winner should be a special motivation injection .	-4.3501
The famous Bayern-Dusel may well need our ladies .	-3.8469
Businesses satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissings Tempo	-3.5103
It was often incomprehensible , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-4.2113
This is apparent after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-3.8950
Chambers and businesses from the region are talking about a change in economic policy on the V question and , at the same time , the old minister .	-6.1654
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Unternehmen ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy , which has all blocked Lemke " .	-4.9744
The biggest U-turn is NATO ’ s infrastructure policy : the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s priority list .	-5.2198
This year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 .	-4.6283
A role in the country ’ s plans is also played by the West Indies Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Traffic Trail Plan .	-7.4642
The aim is to launch the route in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-4.1112
Natus sees this as a way of supporting regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.9097
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( IHK ) Trier aims to increase sales in supermarkets , as suggested by Wissing , to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been taking place for ten years .	-5.9980
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company praises the IHK .	-4.7194
The Handwerkskammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new master bus , says CEO Matthias Schwalbach .	-6.9414
A premium of EUR 1000 for the best master exam and EUR 2500 if graduates make themselves self-employed within ten years of master training .	-6.7495
But the country ’ s house tax list remains long .	-3.1026
In the planned construction of roads , facts can be quickly established , while the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , the chief executive officer of the IHK Trier .	-7.2029
Of 56 new engineers , who want to stop hint at local mobility , only 29 posts have been occupied .	-7.6193
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices .	-3.5355
CDU Group vize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million less in the preservation of national roads than proposed .	-4.7179
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country , as he wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-4.9072
It is also sobering that we have had broadband in the country .	-6.3335
In 2016 , regional companies only assessed net supply in an IHK survey with the note 3.4 .	-3.8761
They complained about stocking Internet connections and breakdowns .	-3.7554
On the other hand , former Minister Eveline Lemke is out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .	-4.2063
The Green Group left Lemke on April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe - where , after four months of disagreement , she had already cleared the field again .	-4.2765
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-4.9206
A day before Audi announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.6141
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' , and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles .	-7.3525
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions .	-2.3584
None of the companies described the companies as a recall .	-3.2338
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-2.6226
But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.0233
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems for neutralising exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles are also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.9660
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-2.8881
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which have managed to regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but which are reduced in normal driving conditions .	-6.7347
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.5738
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.4532
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-4.0212
At the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions legislation in Europe , and a question focused on the United States was extended .	-4.8468
Audi ’ s involvement in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profits .	-3.9132
This message has the floor on Saturday at the Isar	-4.2068
The city wants to protect Isar .	-1.9291
So that the Isar visitors can take part , on Saturday , there will be a raft through Munich , which has a special message . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.8936
If you go to Isar again on Saturday , you will see a big float between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-5.3258
And this is not a usual float , with Isar tourists .	-4.4253
Special attention should be given to the building reference .	-5.0700
On the floss you can see a large Infotransparent .	-4.6705
It shows a garbage mountain .	-1.5488
The launch of a public awareness campaign to appeal to Isar visitors .	-3.6040
With the motto " True Love is ... " the understanding for the Isar is to sharpen as a protected wild flow .	-5.8715
Last summer , the flow over the Isar and this year too , there have been further actions and measures to achieve reckless and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-6.7267
Mordillos Knollennasen and laughter against suffering	-3.2850
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoons , the nolles of his characters are his trademarks .	-4.9551
Even with 85 , the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film .	-4.9226
His message : laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-2.2579
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.8329
In the first years as an artist , he proposed , among other things , as a draftsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him .	-6.0412
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-2.4011
After stations in Lima , New York , and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-5.1514
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-0.8921
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities .	-3.6679
Large , round mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .	-4.4004
In the early morning , he says that he is still sitting in the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.9773
About calendars , puzzles , books for big and small , T-shirts , plush and watches , his drolligen figures continue to be widely spread around the world .	-8.2988
For six years , he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters .	-5.2403
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillo 's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent .	-3.7815
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .	-5.1819
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.5681
The script is not written by him .	-1.6029
This is why he is more likely to rely on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words .	-7.2885
Lavender from Provence is threatened by climate change	-2.6604
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.1646
The lavender is declining due to drought conditions and insects transmitted to diseases , causing great headache to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.0819
Eric Chaisse , expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered , because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-8.8410
This has an impact on the life of lavender .	-2.5583
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cicadas , and there are many of them in very dry weather . '	-5.3127
And there is a lot at stake .	-2.4833
Lavender solder not only attracts tourists , it is also very important for perfume and cosmetics .	-4.5575
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-3.8339
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.7162
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of soil evaporation , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness .	-4.9066
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary .	-3.7004

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico	-1.8506
The Riodoce weekly staff usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in Sinaloa state through organized crime , corrupt officials , and interrogatory drug wars .	-5.8247
But on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.0997
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.8490
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what is more secure : they are supposed to take their children into office , who were the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-6.1882
Security experts have written three words on a cube on the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-4.1056
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary to reach perceptions and feelings of construction .	-5.0198
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s salary list or cartels , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-4.0470
There is no rest from the violence , and , throughout the country , there are more and more journalists in the process : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 after attacks and threats under federal protection , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-6.6953
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration from Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-2.9788
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .	-2.9100
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his middle finger with the word " Justice " , hangs at the facade of the Riodoce building .	-5.2644
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .	-3.4794
Although a special Federal Office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists , only two criminal proceedings have been initiated .	-5.3975
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.3662
In Riodoce , they are still insisting on treating Sinaloa ’ s violence , even though it is unfathomable and even though the terrain is now more treacherous .	-6.2954
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-3.0048
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-2.0368
" As long as we do not know the Why , we distrust everyone . "	-3.9538
In the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-2.5462
He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced from his car , and 12 times was shot on him , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with " Twelve River " .	-6.4015
The shooter went away in his car and damaged it near .	-3.5379
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.6223
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.1793
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan .	-2.1403
But there is virtually no silence on the subject of Valdez .	-5.6939
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlegrounds , as rival groups are struggling to fill the vacuum .	-2.9594
It makes no sense that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of galvanized , two-storey mausoleums for drug kings larger than many houses for the living .	-5.3939
Forget for one minute that there is a state of ' peace ' when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-4.0065
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is to blame for not protecting his friend .	-3.8959
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.5947
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.0709
This release may have annoyed the sons , Gangmitglieder suspected each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-3.6950
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story .	-3.1549
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.0625
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.6800
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined together five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $ 50 holdings .	-7.3921
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.9490
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-4.6517
Reporters loved to be able to publish tough investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dared to treat .	-4.0475
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize " for her coverage in Latin America .	-2.6816
In the same year , Valdez won the Committee 's International Press Freedom Award to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever she led .	-4.4609
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.9557
" I want to continue living " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.8872
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV .	-2.0846
" You must take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumes .	-5.5075
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what happened ? '	-3.5235
The Riodoce team is missing Valdez , the Spaßvogel , who was able to flood like a port worker , the friend who was generous with embrace and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-5.1532
They trusted on their routine .	-2.4877
He would always wear his hat .	-1.7753
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .	-3.3002
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his despair ?	-3.9413
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive .	-4.0112
" They don 't like it if you deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their home runways , to move drugs .	-5.7503
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.3837
The result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-1.9678
Trust your own instincts .	-2.3909
If it is wrong , stay away .	-3.5204
The anger is , said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier . "	-3.8647
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is home .	-3.5692
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.6273
In the space in which Riodoce ’ s employees met for security training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed .	-7.2064
Two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-3.0059
They were instructed by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-3.2692
Half in the joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 % of the policemen who described the governor himself as untrustworthy .	-4.2849
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-4.1945
For this week 's edition , Riodoce has clicked on three main stories .	-4.5771
There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.3736
They also had an exposé on government spending focused on the hometown of the governor .	-3.4194
And there was a group that carried out abduction in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-3.7017
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened , so caution was needed when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows : the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and authorities .	-4.1474
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which ruled all political levels throughout the century .	-3.9892
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high-calibre cases .	-3.1495
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.2480
Only a few months earlier , Valdez ’ s readers would have regarded the column as the best informed source of abduction .	-4.1589
" In the past we would have known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body stature .	-4.0791
" Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken . "	-2.7608
Valdez ’ s office was transformed into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against journalists ’ murders , because employees have become something they would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-4.6156
Reporter Miriam Ramirez scored a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-4.3123
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.8669
A burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.4885
Journalists have become louder throughout the country by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on footpaths and buildings .	-4.3985
On this day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-3.7458
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth .	-3.5746
Since then , she has been asked to be redistributed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-4.7460
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials involved and a society of equal importance .	-4.7376
In his last book " Narco-Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also by politicians and security forces who stumbled with organized crime .	-5.0902
Last year , the Media Guardian Group " Articulo 19 " allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and officials .	-3.8574
" In Mexico you died because they want you to keep the mouth " , said Ramirez .	-2.8952
Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.1141
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border country of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.3074
Your body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-3.8663
A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separated head .	-3.3161
Some branches have chosen to close , such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-3.1816
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-2.6187
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the heading " What do you want from us ? "	-3.6041
Some journalists have fled their home countries , or even the country .	-2.9818
It is a painful decision .	-0.7023
It is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-3.0574
And sometimes they are hunted , as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015 , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City .	-4.4592
For those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-2.7011
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , suggests that drug trafficking scares him .	-3.3273
" Mexico goes hell , so I became reporter , " he said .	-2.8527
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to catch .	-5.5908
A series of shootings with bandages and security forces near the resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .	-4.1932
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a series of cartels in the region .	-3.2533
From the border stone edge , they published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phones .	-4.5850
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-2.0722
Sirene hired near - another shooting in the area .	-4.7748
Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who watched to see if they were willing .	-3.8137
If they were afraid at all , they did not .	-3.2094
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa , the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks .	-4.9451
" As you can only remember to close , " said Bojorquez , " if on the same day that Javier was murdered , the interns asked me to send them to the streets to report . "	-5.4521
Dinosaurs used Tarnung to evade its enemies .	-3.8462
At first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.5681
Researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs " .	-4.2007
It was so good that they were even able to see that his flesh was of reddish brown - and they said it had something of a ' troubled past ' .	-6.8049
The report in the Current Biology magazine called it " the best stocked dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world " .	-4.0638
The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.6069
His unbelievably well preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as " really remarkable " .	-5.2789
According to National Geographic reports , the cultivated herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-4.4831
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-3.1109
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-4.5941
He discovered Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology .	-2.5709
They spent the next six years revealing the wild animal within the £ 2,500 ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earthing slump .	-4.3668
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.7015
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it has slipped , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to see .	-5.4429
" It will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs . "	-3.9987
Researchers have found that this herbivore , although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank , is likely to be threatened by meat eating dinosaurs .	-5.0028
The much-tightened dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as counterfeiting , which is also used by many modern animals .	-6.0548
This would have allowed him to mix better in his surroundings and evade his enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-5.5423
The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.5867
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exploring it carefully .	-4.1006
Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , allowed him to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-5.5362
They discovered the shade , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-4.2622
Although the shade is customary , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today .	-5.1937
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from meat eaten dinosaurs that evolution encouraged the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-4.9174
But most contemporary animals that use contery shades - think of deer , zebras or belts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival .	-7.0258
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive , heavily stocked dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk era must have been , " Brown said .	-4.9535
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown .	-2.0230
Scientists continue to study the animal on evidence of his life , including his conserved intestinal , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .	-4.7552
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was torn into a river and pushed into the sea , where he sank on the back to the seabed .	-5.1131
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-2.9862
" This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is covered fully with canned scaly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-6.4453
" The result is that the animal now looks almost the same as in the early chalk period .	-4.8939
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is in sleep . '	-6.2608
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs , standing on two legs , went through the earth .	-4.7655
Although the king lived from them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , millions years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was driven by some of his fearsome ancestors .	-4.1809
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-2.6445
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology journal , believe that Borealopelta has been contaminated after death in the sea and mummified in the mud .	-4.9345
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada . , , , , and . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.6009
According to the museum , it is the best dressed dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snout to the hip .	-4.0237
The creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.0611
It contained two 20-inch long peaks , which came from its shoulders .	-4.6781
Researchers believe that the stocked herbivores were flooded by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-5.1491
But the water burnt of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail .	-3.8341
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover holy tank plates along the dinosaur .	-4.9285
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is rarely as a win in the Lotto .	-3.3532
The more I see it , the more confused it becomes .	-1.9219
Auction residues of the skin still cover the holy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-5.9275
His right forefoot is on his side , his five fingers are stretched up .	-4.2575
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-2.6591
In the thunderstorm : mass carambolage on A8 : Many injured .	-3.9437
A heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-5.3345
There are many injured , kilometres of traffic jams and suitcases .	-3.5205
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway ( A8 ) , some 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the late afternoon of Thursday afternoon .	-4.4067
According to the police , at 5 p.m. between the stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) , during a thunderstorm , almost 30 vehicles , including probably lorries , were transported elsewhere .	-7.3811
In the first place , no information was provided about the exact number of injured persons .	-5.3132
It is about light to medium serious injuries , said a police spokesman .	-4.0173
A large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .	-4.1911
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .	-2.5092
In the direction of driving in Munich , a 10-kilometre backlog was formed .	-7.4411
As a AZ reporter reported , there were also massive disabilities on the counter-road - through numerous suitcases .	-6.9520
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who now face severe penalties .	-5.5841
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred at the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-4.8285
This led to a collision between a car transporter and a passenger .	-4.5024
A rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .	-2.2999
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.7171
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is waiting for you in the train and sleeping .	-7.2446
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant idea .	-4.1414
And then : pufff .	-1.0011
If the Schaffner comes and awakens an ungentle or rides the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-5.8057
Travel card control .	-4.4290
But the times of interruptions are soon over . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.3356
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creamless ticket control .	-4.8625
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket .	-4.3129
Currently , a test operation runs on two routes .	-3.3427
" We extend the offer .	-4.2231
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , " said a railway precher .	-5.4619
" Comfort Check-in " calls the train the ticket devaluation without Schaffner .	-3.7041
However , in order to be able to use them , a number of conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-6.3750
And you have to book an online ticket - as most passengers already do .	-4.0932
It is also necessary to have bought the DB Navigator via the train , which is the most convenient way to book a ticket .	-6.8999
Last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-3.0941
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works like this : You climb into the train , your ticket calls under " My Tickets " .	-6.2060
A button for electronic devaluation will appear in the test customers .	-4.8402
The attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passengers X is in the train and took the booked seat Y .	-4.7596
If the train attendant is in place when checking the ticket , he knows that there is a passenger with already depreciated online ticket .	-7.5801
So you can sleep further , continue working , keep quiet .	-5.2898
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should be used for passengers .	-4.6727
" If you want to travel with our train crew without ticketing control , check in the DB Navigator is easy to use .	-6.9855
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time in train , " says Michael Peterson , DB Fernverkehr 's Marketing Board .	-4.4274
Second plus : " Our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.5512
Those who often drive trains know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest troubles .	-6.4873
Because often you do not have all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets , in any case .	-6.7395
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to present .	-4.8553
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , which leads to a bad mood in the part or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket , and ultimately takes the time to take care of other concerns .	-8.1806
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.7615
And that is only for ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-3.6877
Further numbers on the same route are not yet available .	-4.2141
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-2.5706
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-2.4941
Just one day after she arrived in New York City , sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.6128
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School .	-2.3901
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " said it .	-3.9157
Realize because nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.4581
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah has been constantly on their timeline .	-4.5352
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed by Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18 year-old , killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo . , live .	-6.5192
He postulated a picture of browns vivid body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .	-4.8982
" This is wild , " Ferrell thought .	-3.3311
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.5488
She put her mobile phone to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield-Drive .	-4.6692
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father who bore a sign saying : ' Ferguson 's police has just killed my unarmed son ! '	-5.0145
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bell dog .	-3.8209
In another video , she said , another policeman secured his rifle and cried : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-4.4029
" This is not customary " , Ferrell remembered her statement .	-3.1629
'This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical ' .	-3.8029
At this moment I felt ashamed .	-2.5391
I was angry and crying . '	-2.2600
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-2.6138
After the landing , she picked her 6-year-old daughter from her father ’ s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-5.0166
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from 11 .	-4.3659
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and who filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.4907
When Ferrell , with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a matching crown , went to Ferguson , the two spoke a conversation they had many times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state « .	-9.4790
" Thou remember how I taught thee when black people have to fight for this , what they believe ? " She remembered what she said .	-4.6756
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and was not right .	-2.8443
I could not take her along , " said Ferrell later .	-2.5651
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.2857
They must know it and see it and be raised in it .	-4.6781
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to free ourselves .	-3.8932
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black woman child .	-5.7681
I have the feeling that I would do her a disservice to keep them away . '	-3.8274
The first station when it arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a campground when activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson .	-5.2564
There , Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .	-3.9364
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.7416
Slowly , a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell .	-1.9016
" My activism changed completely after 9 August , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St . Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.4556
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.6922
Everything has come . '	-2.0069
weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-1.7039
Folayan said they and their cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only " document " what happened .	-2.5755
A question came to Ferrell 's mind : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? '	-3.7536
This skepticism has been fuelled by countless cases of people , often white , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.7971
As Folayan recently stated in an interview : ' We heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not centralise their voices and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-4.1645
Folayan had already worked with the co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death tractors .	-3.2952
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals , followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-5.0631
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us , " said Davis .	-2.8444
" That was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because that is how I will be presented . "	-4.9339
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together " , said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.3128
As a result , documents from " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-4.0326
" I felt like naked " , said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-1.8002
" But I have understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people . "	-4.6642
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement .	-2.3774
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify as gay .	-6.3459
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement overall , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-4.3202
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-1.9674
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.5068
She insists , however , that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-4.4131
" She was the person who stirred up this energy , " she said .	-2.9649
" It is no coincidence , even though it was at the forefront , because in a life at these crossings as a black , gay woman is at stake so much . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.2238
You can feel your energy through the screen . '	-2.6058
Meanwhile , the Ferguson news cameras have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue .	-4.3799
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-4.1483
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-3.5605
However , she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson .	-5.1996
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.0965
It is our duty to win .	-1.0106
We must love and support each other .	-1.1567
We have nothing to lose - except our chains ' .	-2.1023
From Dream to Size : TV readers discuss Bit Gallery	-4.0864
The Bit Gallery moves people , although it is not yet built .	-4.0669
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-4.3089
Kalt hardly makes the subject one .	-4.9025
Also on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " the topic is discussed .	-2.9562
While some say to the Bit Gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really great " ( Nicole Schausten ) , comes from the other side : " Do not brew a man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " magnitude ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.4532
While the supporters are counting on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , as the other shops also benefit , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bloom .	-7.5752
In addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the land where the farmer market hall is located , in which 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-5.9189
At the beginning of the construction work this will stop .	-4.4481
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside .	-6.3936
Simone room : " We have been buying almost weekly in the farmer market hall for many years .	-4.6090
Our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women , are always very happy .	-6.3536
We also discovered the butchers for ourselves .	-3.6457
We would like this offer to be maintained during and above all after the construction of the gallery .	-4.0067
There are also other cities .	-3.0985
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . "	-2.5840
Gerd Densing : " Whether directly marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes up to the level of the rent .	-5.0134
However , this should not be very low in the new project . '	-4.6031
Eva Kilic : " Wozu Einkaufspaläste in Bitburg ?	-1.6854
Whether clothing , shoes , drugstores or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-3.9738
There is enough in our city .	-3.6306
You can see how many shops here are empty - some months and years .	-4.4157
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we should at least retain the market hall .	-5.1219
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , are mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .	-5.3476
As you can see , retail stores are only rented by larger companies in a shopping centre , because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer .	-7.0563
It is a pity that there is almost no more specialty shops and what remains of them will probably disappear . '	-7.8975
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .	-2.7609
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-1.8732
Above all , where is the farmer ’ s market hall to go during the construction period ?	-5.5012
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the Bit Gallery actually comes .	-3.5153
Or does the Gespenst Bit Gallery already manage to sell all shops from Bitburg ? "	-4.9319
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-1.9303
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty .	-3.4521
I think it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .	-3.1653
But for a farm market hall , thanks to the insane many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg no longer give .	-6.4141
When the farmer market hall is broken down , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-4.7683
A matching similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-2.9202
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which almost unnoticeably same - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-5.0159
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from chelsea Manning from chelsea tubes and .	-4.0285
Manning sent out sections from Fort Leavenworth prison , where former intelligence analyst had a 35-year prison sentence after making public diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website classified as secret .	-6.2202
The new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A ) .	-3.4304
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united its expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Manning , a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-5.5155
Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data , a sharp , albeit intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-6.2764
Manning , who was born as Bradley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the espionage law , computer fraud , and theft .	-5.1173
The prison suppressed her image so much that there was only one photo - a grained , black and white selfie in which man is clearly sitting on a driver 's seat and wearing a platinum wig - with which she was associated .	-6.8837
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-3.1503
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette stumbles and chewing gums by extracting DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people might look like .	-4.9605
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.7348
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.6820
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.7893
The artist and her imprisoned Muse have become unequal friends of letters that have been exchanging several letters over the course of two years .	-5.6310
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea would transform his judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-4.7624
That Obama , indeed , was a welcome kind of happy coincidence only a few days after the book was published , calling for Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas .	-5.6982
There is now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new , tweetful ways to further inflate the inflexible divisions that he should actually fix .	-6.9306
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a particular reason " .	-2.8887
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning demanded an end to the " automatic fragmentation , based on gender , race , sexuality and culture " .	-7.7314
On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth meter of Cs and Gs and As written in pencil .	-7.4176
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotide after the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-4.0006
" What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-4.7451
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so this is the 30 of these stories . "	-3.4859
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the aforementioned comic novel .	-4.8487
She shows Manning how she emerges with a free phone in hand from the disciplinary balloon of the United States , such as King 's song .	-7.2363
" When they cold your speech , they won , " it says .	-4.9411
" So never stop the mouth " .	-2.8673
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greeted Philadelphia .	-3.3216
" I still get goose watching when I talk about it . "	-4.8896
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do so , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , from their own genomic simulacs that clash like the hordes of protesters .	-11.2163
This was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Statur ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-5.7105
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits .	-2.4973
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , such as the movement that was also behind its liberation . "	-4.1725
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing .	-4.7915
A nationwide human hunt is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who was sought as suspects after a man was raised in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with lethal injuries .	-5.6782
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued due to their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as demonstrated by the acts of the Cook County Court .	-4.1654
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-2.3119
A Community alert system published by the Chicago Police Agency states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-3.8123
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.5382
Cornell Duranleau was declared dead in the place of what happened , and Detective investigated the plight as murder , while the police actively searched for the two suspects , officials said .	-5.9989
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-1.9438
Alan K. Cubbage , vice president of university relations , said in an email statement that Lathem has now been assessed and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus .	-4.0498
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-2.9915
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.1766
A spokesman of the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in every way possible ' .	-7.4645
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .	-3.6000
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Agency , Anthony Guglielmi , said he urged the suspects to face up to the authorities .	-3.3524
" The police have an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them , " said Guglielmi .	-3.2491
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-2.0716
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building owner of the Grand-Plaza building , who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008 .	-4.2938
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.2438
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.5400
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.1066
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.6046
The management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-4.3999
" We will complete the WAD roadmap in the near future " - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko	-3.2743
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.0210
" RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap .	-4.0980
The WAD roadmap has been updated in this respect , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.8040
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code describing the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and recently published on the organization ’ s website .	-7.7069
According to Mutko , it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .	-3.3797
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-2.3002
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.2296
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation carried out by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-3.8743
Regarding the matter , Mutko said : ' We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake .	-3.9877
All measures have been implemented .	-1.5336
But there were no government programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-3.4730
Mutko ’ s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-3.0541
In conversation with the Russian outlet RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations , but added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.9584
Nobody has any idea of accepting this report unconditionally , " added Smirnov .	-3.6017
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the WADA scandal .	-4.3193
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.4262
After a visit to Moscow headquarters in July , WADA ’ s Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to be reinstated .	-4.3669
Aldi no longer sells eggs for now .	-5.5913
They shared the business groups .	-3.8428
It was a mere precaution that no health impact could continue to be expected .	-7.1345
From now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi , which has demonstrably been tested against fipronial anti-Laedite .	-7.6188
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with its customers .	-3.7581
Start ups that will help your company not become the next Uber .	-4.9171
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e-commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .	-3.5577
Answers were often vague , unhelpful or - worse - fraudulent .	-2.5834
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.6508
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Gesellschaft Madison Reed .	-2.6847
It has called people from outside for help .	-2.4648
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is on the increase to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-4.0074
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , provide anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C Suite managers and directly address the board .	-5.6206
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment .	-3.5117
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glint in the three years .	-3.3111
In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card from the company , which at a glance shows which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can check why .	-5.5408
Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished .	-5.8262
For start-ups such as Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-3.3502
Global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Financial Technical Website Let 's Talk Payments .	-3.7500
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , who helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year amid the Uber case in discredit .	-3.6566
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.3096
Uber recently registered as a client .	-2.3146
Like Glint , Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas .	-5.0925
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behaviour .	-3.7600
And when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-3.2688
" The court of public opinion captured the regulators " , said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-5.7552
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott , employee turnover and complaints , Quinlan said .	-5.1596
Ruby Tuesday , the Restaurant-Kette with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters .	-5.5151
Earlier , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company ’ s headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.5466
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .	-3.1088
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair internships , can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-5.8884
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view into experience with employment , " said Vitrano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-4.3629
" And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . "	-2.3517
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-4.4192
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online .	-3.9538
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.8005
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-3.5616
It is a business model and an opportunity for Venture Capital investors who have supported both startups .	-3.9070
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-2.9268
Glitcers secured $ 10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all funding to $ 60 million .	-3.4082
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture , and venture capital .	-2.4268
There is a growing range of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-4.3187
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-3.1882
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.3562
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.1553
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run when employees are committed .	-5.5282
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.3991
The data on employee involvement in the workplace culture experts is important .	-4.7124
But the data is useless if managers of a company do not take action .	-3.3128
In fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .	-6.3756
And if change does not come quickly enough , or at all , this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees .	-6.5595
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data .	-4.9057
" Because if you do not follow people will ask , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.8870
Do you care about this ?	-2.6985
And whom you do not care about , why should I ? '	-3.1561
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint , so Errett .	-3.9396
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , and add a communication training to address the problems .	-5.4158
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is constantly gaining new insights about its employees , and it hopes that in the long term this will lead to a better link between workers in an industry known for high turnover .	-10.7399
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.9479
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.4063
And if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .	-2.0391
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins	-3.4233
It starts at 23 o 'clock when a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the team 's new practice fields are on the campus .	-6.1564
Some have pulled out their jerseys and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.2720
For a good part of the team , this is a lunch break .	-4.1735
Players who are enrolled in summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three-hour exercise before returning to the waterman Football Center next morning .	-5.6420
" This is a real Tretmühle for the guys the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.6291
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.0244
Therefore , the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 7 : 15 to meet the already packed schedule of players .	-5.4547
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood performed practical exercises .	-6.3258
They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during the course of August , 20 before for against Texas A in September .	-5.8908
Mora said that he supports the NCAA regulatory change , even if they add another item to the player ’ s busy routs .	-6.6719
" We put this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.6844
" And they simply pushed it through , they plack on , they are great people .	-4.4349
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-4.0165
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which , given the clear lines of sight of its fields , has been guarded by a adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the elevated class , which has already been guarded with footballs that have cleared a safety net behind a gate post , will not be an easy task .	-7.9687
Bruins-Spieler should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .	-4.1868
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.1589
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people hire a room there and then prepare to record an exercise .	-4.8194
If you have the video tape from an exercise , it is a pretty good business .	-2.7551
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces in parking 8 .	-3.0773
We will do the best with what we have .	-2.1184
I am not worried too much about that .	-3.5169
We have a plan . '	-1.1357
Facebook wants to intensify fact-finding in the fight against counterfeit news	-3.2819
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake verifiers from third parties , and then show their results under the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news .	-6.0592
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin by using updated machine learning methods to detect possible misdemeanours and send them to factual inspectors who may display results from the original article .	-6.6477
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main defense points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-4.9448
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hasty postings as they did before the September elections .	-4.1054
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands , and Germany .	-5.0702
" In addition to knowing which stories are challenged by fact-checking third-party parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-4.6165
It added that Facebook continues to test its feature to the " related article " and to work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages .	-4.3625
Creating a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.7065
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was seen in an Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.8488
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-4.8995
" I find it so beautiful to look at someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says weary .	-3.8980
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands . "	-2.5592
" A Castle in England " covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney , each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz , Briony May Smith , William Exley , Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg .	-4.3354
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional .	-2.9296
" I only reacted to the pressure of thumb on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 's , who worked for the Jakobiner , " he says .	-5.1808
" That is his thumbprint !	-2.9944
And letters always smell after smoke , because at that time they ignited fire because of light .	-4.8202
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there .	-3.6290
Oh , I love Archive ! '	-2.4071
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( " To be honest : I have a welcome greeting a little exaggerated " ) , this seems all too beautiful to be true .	-5.8352
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted hymns on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .	-5.1495
He wandered through the terrain and ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape owners , gardeners and sometimes also to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-6.1797
Then , at night he trank " Whiskey and started writing " .	-4.2884
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when Elizabeth Hussey died .	-3.5949
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees began to look after the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , wirf it on the attic " .	-5.1589
Tagebücher , letters from the time of English Empires , maps representing who owned what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-4.7396
Young , let everything go ! '	-3.5827
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 farm rebellion .	-5.1865
" There is a record of a turmoil that appeared in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.0762
" The farm uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-3.8069
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-2.3191
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle - like ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit patron who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.1678
Or ' The Smuggler ' , in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.2895
The Darrells are Rhodes 's favorite family of Scotney : " The lords seemed to be quite palate , keep on making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-6.6931
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys , with a talent to advertise herbicides . '	-5.3501
After the end of his mission in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences .	-4.4191
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century , which has been called back by nature since then .	-6.2530
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-2.9595
" I was sad to go back , " he says .	-1.5444
It was like : ' Well , now I have to deal with the damned life again ' .	-4.4679
Campaign started : over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf hides .	-3.8341
With the contraception of the 301 year old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Thursday ’ s round show ) on Friday .	-5.6491
Until Thursday , mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.9042
At the end of August there should be a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-3.6620
" Too nice for us .	-2.4626
Or ? " , ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-4.6117
" We don 't think that ( of course ! ) really " , they write on their website that was released yesterday .	-4.8937
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.6048
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems .	-2.3400
Basically , we firmly believe that we as Bad Honnefer citizens are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-3.8647
The action is about more than " only " a logo and a slogan , it is .	-4.1392
" It is important to formulate an all-time promise , one that gives the city a distinctive one-stop feature " .	-6.6314
After all , they compete with other municipalities .	-2.5043
The city of Bad Honnef has a middle five-digit amount to cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign .	-5.7757
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan 's fear of the army	-2.0189
Every year at the beginning of August , Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) on retirement and carriage in the Official Corps .	-4.7000
This week too .	-2.3052
At first glance a normal procedure .	-1.7098
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.6609
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the Prime Minister 's office .	-5.2459
At the meetings of the Heads of Government , the five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and External Relations took part in the discussions .	-8.9341
In this way , the YAS civilians were in the vast .	-5.1800
The government is attracting the reins in the military .	-3.3515
The Chief of Staff , Hulusi Akar , remains in office , but the commanders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy have been removed .	-5.1584
Since the failed coup , Prime Minister Erdogan fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.1002
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army ranks - mostly because of alleged ties to the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who sees Erdogan as the coup ’ s draftsman .	-6.6628
There have been negotiations in Ankara this week against 486 people who should have been directly involved in the attempted coup .	-4.9699
As early as the day after the coup , Erdogan called the ' worship ' attempt , as he gave him the opportunity to ' completely clean up the armed forces ' .	-6.4787
But has Erdogan really got the army under control ?	-2.0416
At the end of February the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unbehagen im Militär-Hauptquartier " .	-4.8884
At the general level , there are concerns about an increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which manifests itself , among other things , in the lifting of the prohibition of headscarves for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-6.1512
In any case , the large-scale cleansing of the army and the security forces continues .	-4.8530
In mid-July , Erdogan ordered another 7395 officers to fire , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.4529
In doing so , it seemed that Erdoğan tamed the military .	-4.1074
The generals used to be the real masters of the country .	-3.6986
They threw three times , invoking their role as guardians of the secular order .	-4.5611
After winning in 2002 , Erdogan pushed the military ’ s power step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reforms .	-4.4119
Former officers say that Erdogan is pursuing a targeted Islamization of the armed forces .	-3.5007
In the Vocal Europe magazine , a not-so-unknown officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt to prosecute abroad , warned the Turkish army in a few years ' full of extremists and salafists ' .	-5.8098
If that is true , such a development could not leave Nato cold .	-4.3331
In any case , the alliance has doubts about the Turkish army ’ s willingness to act .	-4.5823
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are " weakened " , say NATO diplomats .	-3.2313
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card	-2.2489
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-2.3705
It proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas .	-4.3715
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.8139
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.9589
" This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries receive green cards . "	-3.8742
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.7906
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , ” Trump said .	-4.4400
Ministerium wants to rehabilitate race track for racetrack huts	-6.0175
Over the last few months we have been talking about the future of the racetrack huttles - now we want to go very quickly .	-7.8995
Before the end of the year , it is planned to be built on the marsh track on which the tourist track is going .	-8.0056
In order to secure the future of the racetrack hut in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work is to begin this year .	-5.4734
" With the decision to continue to order and rehabilitate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country is committed to this link , which is particularly important for tourism , " said Minister Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.1645
The cost of repairing the route was about EUR 2.5 million .	-4.1329
Of this sum , the country takes 75 % .	-3.3558
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future , is currently being definitively voted on , declared Sühl .	-7.1517
The Ministry and the South Tyrolean Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .	-3.6549
" This is the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated , " said Sühl .	-4.0734
The planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .	-3.5662
This should be the order for the racetrack shuttle on December 2017 .	-6.8455
The racetrack shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations , especially in .	-5.0052
Over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested to determine whether the distance is used by enough people to order it again in the future .	-6.8462
The route is also very flat in parts .	-5.2254
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried .	-2.3426
Just when you thought that 2017 cannot become even more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .	-4.4270
Yes , indeed .	-0.8419
Sex-robots are a big thing at the moment .	-2.6234
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .	-5.3934
According to Noel Sharkey , emeritated professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield , and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-3.2161
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the chest and the type of fingernails .	-3.9342
" People make fun of them , but the companies provide a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , " said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report .	-5.9346
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-4.5140
The user can also customize his robot according to his convictions , choosing everything from the robot 's eye color to the shape of the chest warts to the type or color of his finger nails .	-5.7144
But it will be even more worrying because many robots have " personalities " who would make a step-woman look progressive .	-4.9984
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.9119
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as shredding .	-4.9001
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of intimacy and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-4.7242
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as well as possible " , blackens the website of True Companion .	-4.0771
Whatever you like , it may not , whatever you like , etc .	-3.8724
She also has her votes during the day - like real people !	-4.5039
It can be tired , fixed to conversation or it can be " in mood " !	-3.8605
There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the submissive female characteristics , the allusions to rape when one takes a step on Frigid ( i.e. , reluctant ) Farrah , worry one most .	-5.7950
On his website , True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.8681
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have a Roxxxxy ? " says it on the site .	-4.3826
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toys .	-3.1188
Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional addition .	-4.5919
Most men , of course , will not hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes their rising popularity , they remain provisionally marginalized in consumption culture .	-5.4958
But what leaks through the periphery can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-6.1217
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-2.0638
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , where there is a president in the White House who has irradiated to have sexually attacked women .	-5.3233
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the winding bodies and the blown eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.7627
The Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump .	-3.1563
The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as possible ( albeit with pornography proportions ) .	-3.6475
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body .	-2.7193
But , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , the robots are not real women .	-3.3757
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply go away .	-3.6788
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation .	-4.0792
In other words , they are fake slaves .	-1.8922
Or , to put it bluntly in 2017 : Cities of Service	-5.6912
Trump ’ s great achievement ?	-1.4556
Mitt Romney is the epitome of common sense .	-2.0455
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have divided families in small format .	-3.1410
Around Christmas and Erntedankfest , there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s rel.	-5.6764
We are all pretending to let our filter bubbles burst .	-3.8333
Less notice has been the power of Trump to bring families together .	-2.3965
I mention this because my cousine , a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.5665
It reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .	-2.4689
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows it , including the Republican kinship with which she fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and curiously on the same side .	-5.0584
This is certainly a good thing to do in the dining table , but it seems to me that this also entails significant risks .	-6.5089
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the staggering effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .	-3.6585
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we are referring to the gruesome possibility that one day his patrons will no longer kill us .	-5.0663
There is , however , an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump normalizes right-wing Republicans , who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality compared to their standards .	-5.0604
I find myself today affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney 's urcomic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) - both of which are in fact a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-6.7900
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an incalculable improvement .	-4.5553
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York Park carousels , and the best three dollars that can be spent in the city if you don 't need a cafe .	-8.2794
The horses are huge , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarce and the animals are twisting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate-perming music conveys this in a strange way .	-6.2710
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.3820
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not completely out of the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a large roundabout in northern London .	-5.6766
The Central Park carousel , however , is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two-year , an 11-year old and two women in the 40-year-old and all have a great time .	-6.8414
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-3.6991
On the other hand , this week I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-3.9477
In the coffeehouse on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option of compensating for the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the charge .	-6.2170
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is needed .	-4.4406
The poor woman in the department store stood apologically grinsend , while I tired of the experience of reaching her credit card with five stars .	-5.7523
Oscar Pistorius with breast pain from prison moved to hospital .	-4.5255
Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.6711
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrestling , according to the prison authorities , following a case in his cell .	-7.1196
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence .	-4.2135
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine ’ s 2013 by throwing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-3.5835
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin .	-3.8714
The prosecutors have announced their intention , this time against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius appeal from which they say that it is too lenient .	-4.2941
The National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to the South Africa Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year .	-4.5828
Pistorius is in danger of being increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful .	-3.5493
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7371
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg .	-2.1658
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the quarter-clanters from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and into secondary schools .	-6.3119
Three of the school students will go to the school in the future , four to the real school .	-5.3905
Schulleiterin Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-3.2228
As a symbol for school leaving , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .	-5.5342
To this end , the muntere Schar introduced a musical entitled " Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf " .	-4.4622
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it erupt from his chickens .	-3.5212
Instead of a chicken hunter , a small eagle came out .	-5.0260
But the hope of making him a chicken was shattered , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain .	-5.5793
After that , the classes showed three and four in the graduation of Yvonne Frank a chicken .	-4.7171
The hens danced with the young gockles , the cylinders carried to the bet .	-4.2044
The eagle stands for integration , said Schulleiterin Angelika Sitte .	-3.4217
The boy is different from the other boys ( chicks ) , but belongs to them .	-5.2938
But he will never be like a chicken .	-3.8302
His rule is to be free .	-3.0827
She wished every four clerks that he felt accepted in his new school .	-5.8998
I would like to thank my fellow Members , former schoolmaster Michael Müller , who has repeatedly jumped into teaching bottlenecks and the parents ' representatives .	-7.8662
Sophia Schumacher explained the school 's teacher .	-6.1013
They leave their students very odd after two years of teaching , because it was really a great time .	-4.5916
Finally , they have been able to rely on the four-legged clandestine .	-6.4839
At the end of the day , all students had a song of summer time and holiday time .	-6.7049
There was great joy among children .	-4.5250
Eight first clampers have already been registered for the new school year .	-4.1969
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-2.0201
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .	-3.2498
On the morning of 1 August , a group of people living illegally were arrested in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-4.1409
On the same day , they were released while an investigation is under way .	-3.1448
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-2.3954
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camps and put significant fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-4.9857
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-1.8766
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-2.5380
Software update for diesel vehicles : What the people affected now need to know ?	-4.3662
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.8051
Do diesel drivers need to take part in the action ?	-2.7606
The most important questions and answers in the overview .	-2.3194
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-3.1311
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 cars .	-4.9694
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-1.7853
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives you an assessment :	-4.3968
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.1886
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.2034
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have thrust software " , says Anja Smetanin .	-3.8954
Their retrofitting has ordered the KBA .	-5.2160
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.0349
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but have not yet given a precise date .	-4.5912
Daimler has announced that he will write to all interested parties .	-5.7750
If an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within its framework .	-3.6794
How long should the overall changeover take ?	-3.9334
" Hey to say " , says Smetanin .	-2.7924
This depends on the manufacturer 's commitment and on political pressure .	-3.7922
" Because we have seen that car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the environment . "	-4.2875
How long should the update take ?	-1.4069
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.9753
It may be more time-consuming to get an appointment .	-3.6166
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-3.1137
The ACE avenues for waiting .	-3.0735
Presumably , foreign manufacturers would follow , Smetanin said .	-4.9232
Is there a massive drop in the price of Euro-4 cars ?	-3.6372
The ACE fears this .	-1.9238
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatening .	-3.6180
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.2182
The ACE advises to wait for a sale .	-3.1633
LL Cool J gets Kennedy Center Award	-2.1021
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glamorous events in Washington .	-4.0001
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political .	-2.4753
One of the winners does not want to come out of protest .	-2.6995
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious awards of the Kennedy Center .	-3.0930
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) .	-3.3994
Give the awards at the beginning of December .	-2.9286
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award ceremony with his wife Melania .	-3.4868
The winner Lear , known with progressive TV series , has already announced that he will not participate in the gala .	-6.5640
The " New York Times " he said : " This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and this is a burden on me " .	-5.7311
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view .	-3.4236
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.4549
The former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-1.9970
We make the city worth living	-3.8886
Roland Wacker , Haslach 's city builder , will retire next year .	-3.2303
The job is already posted - suitable applicants are rare .	-4.5995
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years .	-2.9002
And the work still gives him great fun as he conveys in the press talks .	-4.7617
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successors .	-3.5834
At the same time , he is amazed that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile .	-4.5708
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible time .	-4.1954
In this way - taking into account the regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a review .	-7.9204
Since Haslach acts as a sub-contractor for the administrative community , the applicant must present appropriate qualifications .	-5.2995
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case .	-3.7833
If they were no longer able to fill them , citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice .	-4.2811
But proximity to the people is important to the city and to the city itself , says Wacker , who reports of a good working climate and good mood between the authority and the citizens .	-5.7305
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have been accumulated , with pride on the Wacker .	-5.5622
" We make the city worth living " , he is sure about the building office and its staff .	-5.1872
In the future , however , there are also varied projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for example , are initiated .	-6.0340
The cinematic bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , the stadium renovation is still a topic .	-4.6408
The latter , with around EUR 1.5 million , will hit the bill , ' if we do it properly ' , Wacker estimates .	-7.2060
" All in all , great tasks await my successors .	-3.1879
The work here is fun . '	-2.1927
There is a lot of room for a town builder .	-5.5526
Haslach ’ s own farm and gardening can be reacted to a great deal of flexibility .	-6.0393
" You can move a lot " , so Wacker , and the design of the green spaces is often commended by citizens and visitors .	-5.1116
Since the old town is an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what suits " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing town builder stresses .	-7.9371
In any case , the mayor bears a high responsibility .	-4.5441
He is a builder , " in the end everything runs over my table " .	-4.9555
He can count on many years of work in the field of supervision and coordination : Markus Neumaier ( building ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( underground building ) has been in the process for 15 years .	-8.2164
Also that his successor stays long , Wacker wants : " We are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the job " .	-5.0567
For continuity is important not only for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .	-3.5201
Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed degree as a graduate or a Bachelor with a technical orientation in architecture and have a good knowledge of construction and construction planning law .	-9.7155
The City Building Office is subject to high and low construction , construction management , basic employment matters , administration of urban properties , urban farm with Bauhof and Stadtgärtnerei as well as suburban construction authority including monument protection .	-10.0487
Cycling on lines : Southern railway track closed .	-7.3332
According to the police , the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of Leobener Straße ( B116 ) onto the lines .	-4.3203
These were so badly damaged that the freight train approaching had to be stopped .	-5.2160
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-4.0657
Near the site there were witnesses of a rosaroter roller and a bicycle driver observed .	-6.2239
" This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich " , said ÖBB precher Christoph Posch to APA .	-6.3106
The perpetrators , or the perpetrators , would have put themselves at great risk and endangered rail transport as well .	-6.0120
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail passenger transport , passenger cars could also be made available to the perpetrators .	-9.7373
Overall , the speaker said to be ' significant ' .	-5.8927
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon , and rail transport on the southern route could be carried without disabilities .	-7.0921
Nearly ten passenger trains had lapsed on Friday morning , two of them related to long-distance transport .	-6.2912
Freight trains did not fall , but they were late .	-3.5238
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch , around 200 meters of overhead lines had to be exchanged .	-4.4010
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.5647
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help alleviate IBD ( inflammatory disease )	-2.1701
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.4081
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases .	-3.8410
The incurable state affecting some 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK causes stomach vampses and leaves , recurrent or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-5.2373
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote tolerant intestinal .	-9.0861
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body .	-4.2572
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-5.4732
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it may result in an inflammatory disease .	-3.1893
Experiments found that a kind of tolerant immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their inputs .	-5.4327
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-3.1045
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiomass , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-6.4528
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells .	-3.0187
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in Tryptophan promotes more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal , if the same system also affects humans .	-4.3855
The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immunal cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was housed separately , did not do so . .	-12.3508
She suspected that the difference was with the intestinal robioms of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-5.5645
The mice ’ s dams were sequenced to DNA , and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing from the mice .	-6.4777
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so they lacked a intestinal robiom , and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-5.9197
In order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated by the mice .	-5.2639
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .	-3.6938
When the active component was cleaned out of fluid , it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan-Metabolism , known as Indol-3 dairy acid .	-4.6672
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in mice ’ s feed , the number of such cells rose by about 50 % , but if the Tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.2888
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach intestinal tracts .	-3.3884
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to Tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory disease .	-4.8661
She said : ' The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.5283
Potentially high Tryptophane values in the present of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . "	-4.4712
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed Nemanja Matic to a " genius " .	-4.6219
At Manchester United , Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " , Jose Mourinho believes , after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-3.3716
The £ 40 million signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will .	-4.6720
Matic , however , was excluded from the preparation tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted had to improve before the Premier League season .	-5.7887
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football " , said Mourinho .	-1.7513
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-2.2458
Besides Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium as a Mourinho his start XI for the beginning of the season .	-4.4489
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to meet three of its four priority new commitments .	-4.6784
" To get three out of four , I thank the club , " he added .	-3.6794
" I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . "	-4.0010
Boeing " malt " Dreamliner in the Sky	-1.9388
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-3.1335
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , these are several thousand kilometres .	-6.0507
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.4107
On the radar screens the form of a Dreamliner was to be .	-3.9949
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.7971
Boeing had already made such advertising .	-2.5532
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .	-4.9810
New Deal for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem .	-3.2879
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still the leader of the SPD , Social Democratic Prime Minister always looked at Berlin with some concern .	-5.9013
The most important desire of the campaign campaigners was not just a headwind from the federal government .	-7.7826
This has changed radically since Martin Schulz leads the party .	-2.7703
Since then , the people from the Willy-Brandt House have been observing the events in the SPD-ruled capitals of the country .	-6.9515
What Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with headwinds .	-4.7500
These were deep strikes .	-2.9351
One after the other .	-2.1578
The Bundes-CDU looks after the surprising end of the rot-green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens .	-4.6276
" This shows once again : Red Green simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber of the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-4.0960
The surprising group leak from a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . . , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.2105
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red-green coalition thus lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-4.3790
The Green Leader , Michael Kellner , has called on the breakaway Lower Saxony Green Deputy Elke Twesten to return their mandate .	-5.9202
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate ’ s will .	-3.9200
Elke Twesten must return her mandate immediately , " said the German Federal Business Leader and campaign leader of the Greens to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-5.7349
" That must not be true at all , " a SPD campaigner , as the new Hiobsbotschaft reached the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-6.4661
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there without a government majority following the arrival of the Green MEP Elke Twesten .	-4.9617
It is the interim culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .	-3.9030
And no one knows what comes next .	-2.1088
The plight began with the unexpected defeat of the Saarland election in March .	-3.3122
A blue eye , more not , calmed the comrades at the time .	-3.9349
After the general election in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.5317
It was then made much worse - and that was all very much worse .	-7.3734
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the baptismal , the Dusseldorf bankrupt swept the .	-5.5478
In the weeks after that , the comrades rapped up again .	-6.5058
Then , when they had just gained new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg came .	-3.9290
And with him came the next blow .	-2.2277
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nimbus this weekend because he sat in Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-3.5845
And because , in crisis communication , he then made quite everything wrong that can be done wrong .	-6.5987
Since then Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-3.5075
So now Stephan Weil .	-3.0009
Due to the VW exhaust affair and its role in the supervisory board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticising for some time .	-4.7287
Miese surveys were added .	-1.9359
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because , in recent weeks , it has been increasingly trying to set accents in the covenant .	-6.8545
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was also not concealed in the context of Martin Schulz .	-5.2051
They allowed him to grant him because they promised to stabilize the party .	-3.8574
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.4848
Because there is basically no fault of the Lower Saxony Greens ' internal division .	-5.9916
And Schulz is not at all . . , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.0928
For the time being , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.6702
Your anger is directed at the Greens , and here , above all , at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten .	-5.1665
" It is intolerable and democratic , as Mrs Twesten puts her own careers ' interests above the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the Party Left in the SPD Bundestagsfraktion , the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-5.2822
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the regional list of the Lower Saxony Greens .	-7.5995
The logical consequence would be for them to return their mandate .	-3.0977
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestagsfraktion , laments an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.0914
" The electorate ’ s will was clear four years ago : people made Stephan Weil the prime minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the federal election , the RND .	-6.0485
" Now , the personal careers of a future CDU MEP distorts the election result , " said Oppermann .	-4.3975
He called for the background to be clarified .	-2.6897
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further pledges made by the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-4.3504
Funding for Ortskern III	-2.3054
Anyone who wants to rehabilitate his house in the years can soon receive support from the country .	-5.1254
Furthermore , the mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen .	-4.6787
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a review of what has happened so far .	-4.3296
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas .	-2.9174
At that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding .	-4.4865
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-4.0769
For Schindler , the previous remedies are a ' success project ' - it is important , after all , to promote internal development as well , and not only to open up new construction areas .	-6.6964
On April 4 , the President of the Government of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-4.4502
The amount of funding amounted to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the municipality of Empfingen .	-4.2328
What is the result of a rehabilitation area ?	-3.5197
You will continue to investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-4.1924
However , it also plays a role in whether there is any interest at all in the planned area .	-4.8073
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be postponed again .	-4.8852
The STEC represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-2.1989
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder-Programm " Soziale Stadt " , where the remedies would then be carried out .	-3.8940
The core of the programme is to revitalise urban areas , improve living and working conditions and maintain and develop infrastructure .	-4.7359
The measures would be carried out objectively , that is , per land .	-4.4009
The recovery area would then be defined as a statute .	-3.8906
The grant period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-3.6158
By September this year , however , the inventory would first be carried out , in which the parties involved in the recovery area would receive a questionnaire .	-6.9000
In November or December , as far as possible , the decision on the statute will be adopted so that the remedies can be started next year .	-6.7503
Pietzschmann then explained that any local authority had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .	-5.9789
It is about evaluating and deciding when to restructure urban planning .	-4.8164
It will also be registered in the basic book for the respective property .	-7.1138
Pietzschmann will come again to Empfingen and make a picture of the situation , she promised .	-5.1524
Gotzel stressed that the project is a key success factor for the participation .	-4.7592
That is why there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays .	-5.2322
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and land sheet " , which deals , among other things , with the building state and the restoration plans .	-6.1045
In grey questionnaires , the " household and housing arch " , information on the size , distribution and residents of a residence can be made .	-5.9736
The blue " operating arc " is only to be filled when business premises are operated in the building .	-5.4597
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time .	-3.4914
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .	-3.5425
Schindler still emphasized that the distribution of subsidies according to the " greyhound principle " - who comes first , mahlt first .	-5.6235
You can 't reserve any funds for later .	-5.5123
At the end , photos of the project " Ortskern II " were shown to make the present a restoration " tasty " .	-6.0679
British inventor sets himself up a microchip to get home and car with a hand movement .	-5.3524
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-4.1081
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq .	-4.2302
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisor at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-4.6535
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-2.8325
The company of Mr. Northam would also like to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .	-5.1420
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .	-4.4104
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands	-2.9876
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military ’ s data left to the TIME magazine .	-4.8147
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.8184
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and White House senior officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-2.9644
The Connecticut helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire-fighter from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .	-4.5039
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-4.0807
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his supervisor , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-4.0608
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July , at 7 am , and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-6.1608
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed , a second crew would be needed for return flight due to the limitation of hours .	-6.0702
The original flight crew was on the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground at the plane during the time .	-5.6660
The records made available by the TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .	-4.9124
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.2282
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate the rule .	-3.2700
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-3.7005
" If you are closed , " the deputy commander replied .	-3.6579
The " Made in America " event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-3.1329
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.7186
At the event , the President gave impetus to the reform of health reform , which was under way in the Senate , and he advocated efforts to curb government rules .	-5.3947
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous ends .	-4.8894
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.5684
But to demand their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .	-6.0079
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft ran in Melbourne , Florida against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors .	-5.6577
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made In America " - the products from all 50 countries made by American workers with American materials " , said Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-4.0200
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to set US President in the White House with precise centimetres .	-5.1500
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July , HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House .	-3.4988
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted when training requires the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-4.6097
In addition , helicopter units flew 11 hours on this day for ' non-presidential support missions ' .	-3.7401
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other requirements presented at the event .	-3.3092
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-3.2908
HMX-1 does not have budgeting for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.8314
According to hourly rates of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year , however , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour of flight .	-4.5904
Recordings of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-5.6912
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate .	-2.4426
" The cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for refunds is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.9391
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . "	-3.5090
According to a 2015 RAND study , the DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .	-4.3666
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-2.8013
" The idea is to present things that are made in America this week , " said Spicer .	-2.3282
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , depend on it .	-2.8831
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-3.2490
It is , of course , appropriate to highlight this ' .	-3.0500
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he came to South Lawn for the event , but he moved to the driver seat of a fire-fighting car .	-5.5517
In the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky ’ s representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products .	-3.4930
" I know Sikorsky very well , " the President said , " I have three of them . "	-2.4312

Top runner of the second tennis league will appear at the table third viewfinder SV .	-6.4513
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss starts tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table third viewfinder SV .	-4.1401
Despite five matches , the top runner of the second tennis league still has an impeccable record .	-8.1252
Team chef Marius Zay , however , has respect for the opponent .	-4.4691
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formations .	-3.3481

" As always , this is difficult for us .	-3.2096
You also need a good portion of luck . '	-2.8945
The Neusser team for the trip in the high north is practically standing .	-5.6269
His blue-white debut could give Maxime Janvier .	-1.9896

How America can harm OMV	-2.7239
Indeed , Donald Trump was not happy when he signed on Wednesday to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-4.5585
" In his haste to enact the law , " Congress has packed a few " unconstitutional rules " , he estimated .	-4.2028
The response from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US push .	-3.9710
After all , the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.5167
Since then , investors from the domestic OMV , which , together with other European companies , co-financed the construction of the Baltic Sea Stream 2 .	-5.7325
Drohkulisse is enormous .	-2.7001
However , it is too early to assess the impact , the official statement of the oil company .	-3.8365

Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel is placed at the center of the Netflix series .	-3.6209
Despite the second season of Narcos , which revealed Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-2.6787
The staging three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest males of the show .	-5.0008
With the third season , DEA has focused its attention on the world ’ s richest drug trafficking organization : the Cali cartel .	-4.1249
Led by four powerful patrons , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more state bribes and violent actions .	-3.9884

The clock is turned back in the urban nursery sites .	-5.1715
As of 1 September , Krefeld will take over the food supply in urban children ’ s daycare facilities ( Kitas ) .	-6.6052
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Director of Youth Assistance , this is good news : " We were all very pleased " .	-4.0097
Coke is still out of house : a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked .	-6.0135
In the Krefeld area , the city operates 46 daycare centres , in 44 children get a warm meal for lunch .	-5.7146
In the last Kitajahr , 2800 children were sitting on the tables , and demand is growing steadily .	-5.5157
" Meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week have lunch in Kita , " explains Pommeranz .	-6.2138
" The offer is also valid in the 35-hour service when children stay until 2 p.m. " .	-5.1726
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service from 1 September : they heat up the delivered food , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , carry the meal individually , leave the food , wash it and clean the kitchen .	-8.2976
" The employees are assigned to a kita " , says Pommeranz .	-3.2185
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides on the hourly range .	-4.6470
" The kitchen helpers now belong firmly to the Kita team " , says Pommeranz satisfied .	-4.3756
" So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for Kitaleitung " .	-4.8808
This is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-4.2954
" Children should help prepare food " .	-2.5429
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.8861

This continuity is important for children .	-1.3390
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the job of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .	-5.9137
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , besides improving the quality of the kitchen , also the charm it has shown in comparing costs between ownership and outsourcing for the city as the most economical , is the press office .	-8.5708
And that , although 46 part-time workers are being reset .	-4.0050
" But these hours are not so important to some 750 people in the educational field , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-5.0914

Men are trying to wipe out 13-year-old girls	-3.7496
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to deprive a 13-year-old girl .	-2.8390
According to information from the police , the men spoke to the 13-year-old , who had met friends at the Kolping Street , about 14.55 , because they wanted to telephone the girl 's mobile phone .	-7.6805
The 13-year-old refused the request and continued with her friends .	-4.0458

GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-1.7004
A trade union wants to make sure that the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie 's long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow .	-5.5612
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site .	-3.6237
More than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse alongside other products .	-3.7278
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £ 5 million in recent years .	-2.6252
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be the first to know if their activities changed .	-4.3383
In a letter to the company 's manager , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called for ' concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines would not be pushed forward ' .	-5.7574
GMB seniors organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Secretary about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply .	-4.5545
Generations of families have worked here , and workers are focusing heavily on the local community and the large area of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation .	-7.3730
That is why , from the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , rising cost of living and chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie .	-5.8955
A spokesperson in Pladis said : " The Filialleiter at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly because we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-5.3817
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where a number of issues were discussed openly . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.1359
We discussed with the staff that we , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.5864
She added : ' In recent years we have invested more than £ 5 million in our Tollcross-site site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-5.3592
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site , and if our operating processes change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this .	-6.4036
Has the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago about Ney?	-2.6634
The La Liga side may regret its interest in Marco Verratti	-3.1870
Paris Saint-Germain will not fall in its pursuit of Neymar , having made an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the World Record ?	-6.9318
The sensational approach fueled the summer transfer window , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record for more than twice the previous mark , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £ 89 million last season .	-4.5408
After the end , Neymar will become the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest paid professional sportsman .	-5.4515
Barcelona is furious about how Neymar forced his way out , even though a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to deal with it since its arrival in Santos in 2013 .	-5.0721
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president ?	-2.6826
When Manchester City declared interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.2883
" I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.9115
" We respect all clubs .	-0.8291
But if they try to sign one of our players , that will have consequences . '	-3.4749
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club beginning this summer expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti .	-3.6738
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International to travel from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar .	-4.8377

On Thursday evening , the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum , with his VW at 19.55 , was on the B 215 from Stolzenau , heading towards Leese .	-5.1292
In the area of Stolzenau , a car came up against him on his road so that he had to turn right .	-9.5173
At the same time , the tour operator touched the track schedule .	-6.9764
The damage caused by the car came into being .	-5.4263
The driver of the upcoming car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident .	-4.9558
It may be good , according to the accident , that the Mercedes-Benz driver had not even noticed the accident .	-5.0192
The police are now asking the witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the polluter 's experience , to contact the Commissioner at Stolzenau at 05761 / 92060 .	-5.3995

Christian Weisnder , Speaker of the Reforming Movement " We are Church " , explained after publication to the German Press Agency , he expects from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emeritated Pope Benedict XVI .	-5.0599
It would serve the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their misappraisal of what happened at the time .	-4.6249
The Vatican Council , on the other hand , criticized " Osservatore Romano " for having double standards in reporting on violence in the domain .	-6.8159
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it would be ' shameful and shameful acts ' that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but the ' degree of media manipulation ' , the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee .	-5.7444
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal " , writes Scaraffia .	-4.6786
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerische Rundfunk : " You are happy to go to the church and that is a attached frescoes " .	-6.1149
She also pointed out that , in her youth , ' a quite normal pedagogical tool ' was in order to cope with french children , as I was , ' .	-7.6685
They would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.6937
In connection with the reports on cases of abuse , Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-4.9426
Unjustifiably , the author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the memorial band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) , . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.9589
" I must protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he evaluates the results of the final report .	-3.4646
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?	-3.5766
A total of 547 Regensburg domains were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 domains .	-4.7942
In the final report , Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , says : " In summary , it can be said that in many cases , Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence .	-5.8177
Particularly with high emotionality , punishment for the pupils could also be more severe .	-5.5208
Despite this , contrary to many other accusations , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even have positive memories with him .	-7.9761
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger , in his opinion , relieved .	-4.8773
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the ' acts of violence against defensive persons in the Regensburger Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-5.9285
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity " .	-3.2186
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist , who became more handgrip when a dome did not perform musically .	-6.5695
How do you view this final report as his biographer ?	-3.0320
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is actually there .	-5.9989
Eight pages have just been devoted to it , and it is clear that every suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse has been released .	-7.6570
The violence of the preschool also took place outside its sphere of action .	-4.8722
You can accuse him of being too late or of not taking the first indications seriously enough .	-5.8027
The domain narrative on which he acted was perceived by virtually all respondents as " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-5.6440
Thus , the vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , also exhibits an excellent testimony , describing him as a " warm-hearted " , " sincere " , " competent " and " sympathetic " , as a highly tireless teacher who regularly sent the boys with cakes , biscuits and bonbonbons and was " always surrounded by children 's grapes " .	-7.7159
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which also led to excesses .	-4.6538
He has expressed deep regret and apologies to him not only with stools and threw the key league on the ground , but also distributed ear cowardly and excused young boys to the hair or ears .	-9.6137
But his salvation of honor must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question , the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , among parents and teachers .	-5.1387
Do you also know such ignition methods ?	-3.4053
Of course , I think each of us born before 1968 .	-2.4177
I too have seen this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-3.3761
Compared with what this report is about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence on the pre-school , these are , of course , dreadful .	-7.0871
This is where one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him .	-8.4243
After all , many of the Bavarian popes who have never understood him are still working diligently .	-5.1415
The truth is , however , that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-3.4717
In the media , a great deal has been said about the issue of abuse in the Regensburger domain lanes in connection with the report .	-5.8748
Will Georg Ratzinger , in the final report , also be charged with any involvement or participation in sexual abuse ?	-4.3494
Michael Hesemann : No .	-1.9773
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the domain master .	-3.9511
Not even the parents were consecrated .	-2.8467
" I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it , " said a affected deputy for the others , " I was very embarrassing " .	-8.5421
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent .	-3.4922
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings , it is certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator .	-5.7694
How do I assess Ratzinger ’ s role in the abuse cases ?	-5.0431
Michael Hesemann : As a questioned student put it , " Regarding sexual abuse ... do not see a case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrators .	-7.1645
I also think it is really absurd to assume that he ... has opened a bunch more intrusive or clearer or more open than to their parents , internship managers , trust teachers , etc .	-9.4863
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . "	-3.3538
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to them in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation ' .	-7.4508
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , therefore , Georg Ratzinger is to be released from any fellowship .	-4.7091
Nor can it be accused of preventing or displaying it .	-4.9775
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these appalling crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases .	-4.6330
In the media , much of " Gewaltexzessen " was to be read in the Regensburger domain lanes .	-5.6539
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of looking the way in the report .	-4.3506
Do he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.9404
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed and merged into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle , Georg Ratzinger .	-4.9892
But that , in turn , is an abuse of the report .	-3.2001
After all , there is a clear separation between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the domain lanes , between sexual abuse and violence , and , let us say , other accusations .	-7.8874
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir manager of the domain tracks .	-5.1450
The whole dreadful caning pedagogy , the cases in which infusions of sadistic teachers were truly harassed and maltreated , all occurred on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions have to prevail .	-7.6526
However , Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the dome encymnasium .	-5.9910
In this , as most witnesses emphasize , the theme " pre-school " was taboo .	-4.5209
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradisiacal " conditions .	-5.0545
What was different about the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-3.4258
Michael Hesemann : While there was discipline , there was no sadistic violence .	-3.2314
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories link with him ' .	-6.3423
At the most , the accusation remains to be swept away .	-6.1448
However , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the conditions on the pre-school .	-5.1351
For the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and was not responsible for the events at a school where he had just not worked and was not responsible ( so the witness ) , and then only about 1993 .	-8.6947
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears before the states ?	-5.0945
Michael Hesemann : No , because as long ago as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-4.1090
In this , he points out that ' caning is still practised in the pre-school ' .	-5.2707
In the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.7852
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when caning was banned in Bavaria .	-4.9267
Before that , they were in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-4.8276
It was difficult for him , too , to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized , and where the permitted limit had actually been exceeded .	-7.2135
However , we cannot say that he has always looked away .	-4.3142
That is simply not true .	-1.2297
In 1980 , caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-3.6635
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to the time .	-3.4355
How do you see that ?	-1.6608
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " Fallstrick of Anachronism " , that is , the danger of evaluating past by moral standards today .	-4.6203
The princes are right here .	-3.6278
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was odious at all times , nor to what was hidden in the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children ’ s souls , which goes far beyond what was then common practice .	-8.1293
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .	-4.2500
At the same time , however , I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-4.7319
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to say slap and draw on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-5.4732
As a physical punishment , he has also strictly adhered to it .	-4.3286
What image of his Regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger give in talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-5.0440
Can the subject of caning also be discussed ?	-5.3073
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict XVI , from his perspective , because the domains played only a minor role .	-4.6758
Nevertheless , I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.9422
But this must also be said : without this perfectionism , without demanding unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-5.9053
With biscuits and bonbons alone , you will not be a big singer or any success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-16.4957
When what kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book ?	-4.9742
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and have always seen him as a wonderful , humorous , ground-like , deeply believing and heartfelt person , one of whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything except a fly .	-9.2596
I regularly get to know how many former domains still today , 23 years after his emergency , keep in contact with him regularly , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-6.0705
So those who have not forgiven him until now that he was too strict are clearly in the minority .	-5.4318
Most of the domains are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music closer to them .	-4.3234
And that he is always a good , paternal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also an affectionate respect to which he was still standing up today and which he almost honoured .	-10.2087
And I would ask you , once again , to make it quite clear that everything you accuse him is a method of education that was on the agenda at the time .	-7.2962
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .	-3.8770
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media scapegoat .	-4.0300
It is all too obvious that there is a bad intention behind it .	-4.5718
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-3.0353
Now the decency would finally lead to a 93-year-old man who has gained a great deal of merit and who , without knowing the domains of Regensburg , would not yet be in peace without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany .	-10.6016
