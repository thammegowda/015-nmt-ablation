Munich 1856 : Four cards that change your view of the city .	-2.5538
A deception in which young people are to meet today .	-5.5511
A Gruftkapelle , now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel .	-4.3980
Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers .	-4.3475
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .	-2.7337
It nerves when maps are not up to date .	-3.1252
Everyone who has had to get off the ground already knows this , because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road .	-13.5460
The historical maps of the Bayern-Atlases digital map , an offer by the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but that is precisely why they are very revealing .	-6.5269
Especially when compared to current online cards .	-2.9368
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the burial area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century .	-4.6771
The Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that you don 't recognize as such .	-4.7404
For cities and municipalities , more detailed maps , so-called Urpositionsblätter , have been incorporated into the great overview map .	-6.8229
This was established according to the Bavarian survey management between 1810 and 1864 and was the first survey of Bavaria .	-5.9934
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.2394
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War .	-3.0222
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria for military purposes , of course .	-8.7587
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9 , 1801 , today ’ s neighbors created the idea of a universal Bayern card .	-5.9727
Kurfürst Max IV . Joseph continued the project , founded the " Topographische Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey management .	-5.5371
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek website .	-4.8340
The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the provincial capital .	-5.0010
The city has spread in all directions and has grown together .	-3.5023
An example of this is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-7.0106
Sendling was introduced 21 years after the map was created , in 1877 , when Munich was part of the district .	-6.0219
Today , Untersendling is located in the heart of the city .	-3.2798
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstrasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878 , a leader of the insurrection of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-4.3081
Where the West Park is today , there is nothing to be seen as fields - at first glance : when zooming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand-written numbered pieces of land from the so-called ' initial photograph ' from which the base tax was derived .	-9.1188
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the " Land in the Sun " facility .	-7.7734
A large green area is located north of Untersendling .	-2.5866
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century .	-4.7821
On the other hand the Isar gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.7909
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read not only the street name " am Gasteig " in the area of today 's Au-Haidhausen district or the height " Auf der Lüften " - but also in big letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-5.4994
Yes , here at the Auerfeldstraße people were once locked up with delusions .	-4.3042
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt " Auf der Auer Lüften " was born .	-4.0765
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-5.5385
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , anchoring the so-called irritation .	-4.5738
In addition , he has prohibited the personnel from using violence against the inmates , " says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Haidhausen Museum , who has worked with the institution for an exhibition .	-6.1420
There was room for 280 patients first , and then 500 seats later .	-6.2609
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905 .	-4.4534
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany , is located there .	-4.2841
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt young people are now meeting in Salesianum in Munich .	-5.6907
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities .	-4.2710
Westlich lies the football site of TSV München Ost , east residential buildings from the 1980s .	-5.0633
In 2015 , the children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built , in architectural style , following the original construction of the Irrenanstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War during bombing .	-8.1875
The Marienplatz was named " Main Square " by 1856 , the Kaufingerstraße was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.4679
A decisive change brought the Second World War to the heart of Munich .	-3.1853
The Allied bombs in December 1944 put many holes in the city centre .	-4.6534
A large one remained until today - at Marienhof .	-8.8719
The English Institute , small business houses and a medieval Gruftkapelle once stood at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work was carried out these days , and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn line line .	-7.6701
With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with today 's aerial photo - and fill the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.9884
Citizens ' Rights Group publishes travel warnings for Missouri	-2.7998
The National Association for the Promotion of Color has issued a warning to colorful people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State .	-4.5814
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travelers , visitors and missionaries to pay special attention to travel through the state and exercise extreme caution , since a number of questionable race-based incidents have recently been occurring throughout the state and are noted here , " says the group 's opinion .	-7.0859
A recent law passed by Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to gain discrimination , and the law enforcement authorities of the state , which are disproportionate to minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , said the NAACP .	-6.3195
" They have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-3.3276
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten up or killed , " said the president of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.5253
" We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . "	-3.0884
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US .	-2.4793
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.0889
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol in the state during the trip and was detained by the police of Missouri , without being accused of a crime .	-6.0028
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri General Prosecutor 's Office , which shows that black drivers in the state are held 75 % more frequently than whites .	-5.8577
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.9166
" People must be prepared to bring bail money or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state . "	-4.8357
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s Hasscrimes report program , which classifies the state as 16 in terms of the number of such injuries .	-12.3649
Travel warnings are also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-3.3445
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration offences , which , in the ACLU ’ s view , will contribute to further racial profi.	-5.1402
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.8444
Weidezaunprojekt is elementar	-1.8028
The Fischerbacher Weidezau project is a success project and will continue next year .	-3.0049
The CDU MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on the ground .	-4.5575
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-4.8608
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm , where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated five holiday guests .	-5.6343
The Black Forest Milk is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , Schwendemann .	-4.8116
On the table of holiday guests comes exclusively regional .	-4.4442
Since he is also the chairman of BLHV of Fischerbach , he described the Weidezaunprojekt as " elementary important " .	-4.4360
I cannot make a profit in such steep areas .	-3.7913
A lot of work needs to be done with the Motorsense .	-4.4779
" We have to fight with the conditions and topography here , " stressed Schwendemann .	-3.8526
In 2003 he took over the parental business and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not run a bio plant .	-5.6274
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipalities recognized the importance of the Weidezaunprojekt and are glad about the Leader project " .	-6.0760
At a cost of between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .	-3.5629
It is to be hoped that this will allow the reforestation of the land to be extended for a while .	-6.6229
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they continue to operate , " stressed the mayor .	-5.6434
Farmers are often criticised for their support .	-3.0413
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in by wheat mining .	-4.9279
The area of disclosure is thus 40 hectares which cannot be explored until at least 2023 .	-5.5685
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was promoted via Leader , a quarter contributed to the Fischerbach community .	-6.0381
Thus , farmers have remained at EUR 12 610 , which they have had to invest in 16.2 km of wheat fence .	-6.1557
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-2.3546
Kordula Kovac stressed : " Your job is good , without farmers and rural women it is not " .	-7.6060
Peter Weiß also said : " Best food is produced here " .	-4.3269
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of fences .	-4.1851
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.5481
The prerequisite is the existence of a support framework designated by the LPR .	-5.8923
In addition , the area to be fenced must not be traceable ( sloping over 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-7.0829
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 plots , who want to build almost 16 kilometers fence .	-6.0030
The open area is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-4.7633
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.0998
Now Trump ’ s White House is taking the Statue of Liberty in front of it .	-4.8304
The surest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues .	-2.5540
Americans , like everyone else , appreciate the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.6189
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the status of freedom .	-4.3761
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-2.2002
A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have borrowed him if he had done so .	-3.8113
But he grasped their importance , and especially the importance attributed to it , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-5.4015
When Miller Acosta shouted : " I don 't want to go into a complete story here , but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world enlightens .	-4.8500
The poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '	-3.7307
Miller is right , but , as he said himself , it is not really about history .	-3.9523
It is about the contemporary resonance on the shattering words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mosquitoes , your poor , / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely , / the elding waste of your rich coasts ' .	-7.2093
There was never a time when the ' wretched waste ' was better seen on our screens .	-3.8734
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome to Trump ’ s US .	-2.4854
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-4.1521
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act .	-4.9426
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in an abused classic image .	-5.3799
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-3.3115
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of exiles .	-2.6547
The link between poem and picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-3.3176
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .	-4.0941
The great horror of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservatives who bring the American flame to the world around : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.8295
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.5341
The torch should not go down the road to the United States . '	-3.6266
Limbaugh is quite unusual here .	-4.0412
The importance of the statue is , in fact , a question of the position of perception .	-4.4326
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , elding but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-5.0076
It is , in the truest sense , about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.5060
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the will they must hear .	-2.8021
Of course , that is not the prospect that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-3.5541
Their torch is not to be illuminated , but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power .	-5.4019
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team .	-2.3213
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team .	-2.7962
The UK athletic director , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team in the world championship ' .	-11.1938
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.3784
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and that the UK 's athletics must learn something from it .	-4.2549
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , " said Black .	-2.8871
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2886
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-5.2257
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-1.9332
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.7028
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.6877
Several of Scotland ’ s athletes are medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route , while Eilidh Doyle was elected as team captain .	-5.7455
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.5451
Her captain 's speech was unbelievable , " says Black .	-2.0728
" A number of athletes , regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-4.1978
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great . '	-4.5071
The Commonwealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400-m hurdles , says that it is " unbelievable " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.1931
Scotland ’ s best overall number of athletes in the World Cup has been seven in 1983 and 2015 .	-4.1577
Muir , the medium-range runner , is on this path and has set five British and two European records last year .	-6.7174
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m Läufen .	-3.4252
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot who should watch the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games after a great season .	-4.8312
Doyle recalls her first world championships when the only other Scot in the Lee McConnell team was .	-4.3403
The team chapter says that it is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of its compatriots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also in the medals and in the finals .	-5.8607
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me , makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-6.5853
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.0712
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.6952
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb podiums .	-3.4130
As regards my speech as a captain ?	-2.9022
Yes , I think it went well .	-1.5596
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a World Cup home .	-4.0566
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-4.5069
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . '	-4.3260
Blocking critics on Facebook : Don ’ t worry about a public office if you don ’ t have the power to fuel voters .	-6.6990
The father of our country knew something of a bad press .	-2.2023
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to swallow him for everything from domestic politics to its political principles .	-4.6832
He shifted in the criticism , safe .	-4.4358
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.3968
For in 1783 Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupid , we shall be led to slaughter like sheep ' .	-4.5682
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.2508
Hogan 's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-4.5680
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week .	-3.7487
The governor 's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Well , and ? " .	-6.6112
" It 's just Facebook , " many people said .	-1.8937
But it is important .	-0.7528
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.5478
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular .	-2.1394
He has the second highest approval of the nation ’ s 50 governors .	-2.9023
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-1.1187
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to principles .	-4.1422
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing his homeless head to chemotherapy on his side .	-5.4228
Therefore , blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called official and paid by public taxpayers - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-5.3906
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation .	-3.5335
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing online the stick .	-4.0229
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-2.1536
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a pastor , not a troll .	-3.2491
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful , and not profane .	-1.9483
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-2.5643
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hasserfüllt , but she asked for hate crimes .	-2.7748
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary area of the news program " The Post " .	-3.5706
" I do not appreciate this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then some people disregard it as a so-called collective effort and do not recognise it as a large group of affected citizens . "	-7.4816
What the governor 's staff called the " concentrated spam attack " would probably call " advocacy " .	-4.4060
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.8186
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same thing had been done to send staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest demonstrators and silence them .	-5.4210
But that is exactly what is happening in digital terms .	-2.8050
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-2.4660
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-3.3182
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia .	-2.2660
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page .	-4.0784
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.1715
That should not be so difficult .	-1.7346
At the time of Washington , the era of affordable portos had a similar effect to the Internet .	-3.7338
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters swallowed up his leadership .	-3.6162
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.4491
The people who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-2.7572
Petitions that overwhelmed his position on the Treaty of Amity , trade , and shipping with the United Kingdom were overwhelmed , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project .	-4.3423
But he did not silence them .	-2.0868
Freedom of speech , difference of opinion and discourse are the basis of our nation .	-2.8344
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.5841
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club .	-2.4316
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-4.4342
The Northern Ireland , which led links to the final round in the Archerfield last year before losing to Paul Eales , is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi .	-6.2475

He is an eager advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .	-2.9319
This is a great showcase for this course . '	-2.5592

Gary Orr , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday , returns to the action on homeland .	-3.9521
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-2.1653
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.3347
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .	-2.9010
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .	-2.1566
I am pleased about the way things have gone . '	-3.6280
With the trio in the field , former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty are .	-3.2912

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking	-1.7236
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.0043
This is the result of a study by the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) .	-3.8840
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases per year are due to passive smoking , " said study manager Heiko Becher .	-3.4502
In comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .	-4.6491
At that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking in Germany per year .	-3.8356
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-2.0580
Household connections prove to be very complex .	-2.6761
The construction works in Villinger Straße are in full swing and " are reasonably in time " , according to the head of the Bauhofs Fred Heinze .	-4.8061
In the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , because there is a lot of hidden underground , which is not recorded in the plans .	-7.0445
The transport , which constantly obstructs construction work , is a major problem for the construction of the Stumpp company .	-6.2203
" The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous " , says Heinze .	-5.3224

It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was admitted to Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum , when only 1,026 elders were to vote by public handing over to the occupying forces .	-5.4467

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of Asia ’ s worst child mortality and literacy rates .	-2.6467
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold country .	-2.0810
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Paniai , a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.8304
In 2015 alone , Freeport declined $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-2.4225
Moreover , Papua has an estimated $ 78 billion worth of timber resources .	-2.5910
These riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence .	-3.7223

One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and came back with four soldiers later , according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-7.4007
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .	-3.2285
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.4282
One child , 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma .	-3.4565

Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for calm and demanded the crowd to return home .	-3.4482
No one was in the mood to listen .	-2.2120
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .	-3.3252

Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to address historical human rights violations .	-3.7565
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.7501
" Most injuries occurred a long time ago .	-2.2059
Some were in the 90 's and early 2000 's .	-2.4465
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , " he said .	-3.8895
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.8301
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-2.2829
Wiranto , accused of " crimes against humanity " by the UN , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved , including the Paniai incident .	-9.7529
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim disbelief .	-5.0349
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.6621

" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.6721

His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.2448
He says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .	-2.3500

Surrounded villagers protested at the company 's location office .	-4.0638
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing hot shots .	-6.9928
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .	-9.6168
" We were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and was witness to how the injured were delivered here quickly , so the TIME .	-4.2333
" I hid me two days in my house . "	-3.4426
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for withdrawing the mobile police brigade from the area .	-3.8640
Paniai has always been an unrest for the Indonesian Government .	-3.0298
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal Mee , Moni , Dani , and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.5630
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-2.9924
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.4150
In response , thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained under the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-3.7089
Some never appear again .	-2.3670
Among the people in Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-3.4976
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.4069
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.4725
Bread is equally out of reach .	-4.7302
People here are building everything they eat : Nota and fruit and leaf vegetables in particular .	-4.4147
Agriculture is the job of women , who can work on four or five fields of sweet potatoes .	-5.1497
They retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.6812
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-2.2562
Over time , economic inequalities between local Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport .	-5.2595
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better educated and wealthier migrants .	-3.0615
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .	-3.4546
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money " , says John Gobai , chairman of the Paniai tribal council .	-3.5376
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.5440
Moreover , restrictions on international media coverage remain strained .	-2.7310
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , even though they were given the rare permission to film .	-6.6125
According to Phelim Kine , Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-3.4920
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-3.6548
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-3.4184
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Salomonen Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai Shipyard .	-3.4700
The same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.1710
The spokesman of the Indonesian State Department , Arrmanatha Nasir , rejected the group 's allegations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' In Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.9913
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-2.3597
As an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , Jayapura , visited on 4 May , locals braked their silence and pressed him " We want freedom " , according to a source who also attended the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .	-6.3800
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-2.7409
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai committees , " says Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council .	-4.4847
He wants Jokowi to know that , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , the Paniai people are in poor education and health services .	-3.3659
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their vote for Jokowi as a " guilt " he has to pay back .	-3.9029
" They don 't need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.4204
Despite threats and intimidation , Paniai victims ’ families carried out a last symbolic act of defiance : the victim ’ s corpse was buried on a territory just opposite the police and the military station .	-5.8175
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .	-3.6952

Fire captures the Dubai skyscraper for the second time .	-3.2958
A fire took place on Friday in one of the world 's highest residential towers in Dubai its diary and forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337 meters high 79-storey building .	-4.5274
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years , which is sometimes called the Torch Tower ( torch tower ) .	-9.1621
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.0035
" We slept and we stood up in the fire alarm and in the cries of the people .	-4.4592
We ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , " a resident who told his name as George , Reuters .	-5.2274
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that fire-fighting units fired at 4.00 a.m. local time ( 00.00 a.m. GMT ) fire and cooled the building .	-6.0114
The government said it is working to provide shelter for those affected .	-3.2663
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outskirts of high-rise buildings around the world .	-4.2423
An investigation carried out by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the lining , the exterior lining to decorate or isolate .	-6.0808
In the United Kingdom , the police said that they believe that the system of panels for insulating and covering the London Grenfeld Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died .	-5.3312
No Davis Cup Reform : Next Best of Five	-3.0930
The President of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has fallen through the General Assembly with his great Davis-Cup-Coup .	-4.4797
At the Ho-Chi-Minh City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup-Individuals only on two payouts was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-5.9811
This is often very long , but it is precisely for this reason that very esteemed five sets of classics are retained to the traditional competition .	-9.2889
63.54 % of the member countries voted in favour of the reform , so ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal was barely missed .	-4.6280
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members did not adopt the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup .	-2.6797
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical contests , " said Haggerty .	-2.8910
We will continue to work to improve the application .	-3.3030
It was not until the vote that , after many inconsistencies , the proposal had come to the conclusion that the final would be held in a neutral place .	-7.0785
New from 2018 are only comparatively small details : Finalists will have the right to win the Davis Cup and Fed Cup in the coming year in the first round .	-5.9340
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places and so on will be facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-6.5038
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring banned items to the plane , a survey finds out .	-5.1164
A survey of airline passengers revealed that more than 20 % deliberately or unconsciously banned items were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 % that entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades .	-6.6051
Less than 1 % claimed that they had been belatedly discovered that they had been irritated by firearms , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.9538
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers disregard the rules .	-4.9790
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % that were members of Generation X .	-4.3244
The most common items that were deliberately pre-mixed with TSA agents were food and liquids .	-4.6587
More than 3 % said that they knowingly carried items with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft .	-5.6384
The company said it consulted travelers throughout the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggling goods would have brought through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .	-5.3369
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggling goods , whether knowingly or unknowingly , through safety were those who fly the most .	-6.0317
However , the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.4988
People are often insecure about what liquids they can take with them or how much of them .	-5.3916
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids captured by TSA are prohibited .	-3.9822
For a while , the people who saw TSA could see books as smuggling .	-3.9237
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .	-1.8797
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order .	-4.8150
Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.8123
He has so far failed to accept that part of the customer has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-5.5513
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on revenue increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed another , less glamorous figure in announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet : the number of cancellations in the new mass market model 3 .	-6.6083
In the last few months , Musk has often promoted more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .	-6.3082
Now Musk admits : 63,000 of the 518.000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn .	-5.1004
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-2.5448
If cancelled , Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 and UK £ 1000 ) " Reservation Payment " completely .	-7.2679
Currently , 455,000 such non-binding reservations were made , Musk admitted at a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.4040
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling up to now could be a problem of around 12 % of all orders .	-5.8943
His argument is that the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-3.3587
Last year , Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.6551
2018 it should be - all models taken together - 500,000 , 2020 one million .	-3.7722
Demand for this is obvious .	-2.0109
According to Musk there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-3.1919
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum utilization .	-6.5768
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.8299
If there are major delays , however , then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become the problem for Tesla .	-5.6909
After all , the company cannot prevent discontented customers from getting away in droves .	-5.1433
EPA chief Pruitt is withdrawing from the Obama Era ’ s rules to reduce emissions , owing to the excise duty .	-6.7134
A day after he was indicted by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the chief environmental protection authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog caused air pollutants .	-6.4664
Pruitt presented the change when his agency responded to the needs of state environmental authorities more quickly than previous administrations have shown .	-5.4071
He did not mention the complaint raised against his previous post in a federal court .	-4.4894
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground level ozone .	-3.5989
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid " interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth . "	-3.7103
Pruitt , who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before he was appointed by President Donald Trump , has long been a staunch opponent of stricter environmental legislation .	-7.4708
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry oppose .	-3.9010
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.0596
Last month , a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage .	-9.2875
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards simply enhances the EPO ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-9.3268
" Under previous administrations , the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by groups of activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " Pruitt said , who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.8876
" We do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously .	-3.3425
We also take seriously the law and the authority that we have . '	-3.0088
However , the EPA 's opinion said that Pruitt will at some point use its ' power to delay and all the other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on sound policy and the best available information ' .	-5.3113
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of the ozone rules .	-2.9286
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.7526
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.2957
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that the EPO had sue for this week , said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure .	-5.1406
" The reversal of the EPA - following our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.7796
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington and the District of Columbia .	-1.8253
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight .	-3.4452
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for vulnerable groups of people , and every year thousands of premature deaths contribute .	-4.0128
Public health officials and environmentalists applauded Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-3.2024
" It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.4753
" We must continue to fight against the Trump administration 's ideological crusade of attacking polluters and their particular interests " .	-4.3378

Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique dörfliches gem " .	-2.9924
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergisches Urkundenbuch urkundlich : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber .	-5.4976
According to the text of the document , on the Tumlinger Berg , apart from the former parish church , there was also a stately courtyard , one of which belonged to the church or the patron 's right and not vice versa .	-7.4883
So there were also people there .	-3.3679
As shown in the description of the town of Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858 , next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen , the " mountain " was the third , the ruling settlement centre of the village .	-6.9461
Old maps dating back to 1600 underpin these historical realities .	-5.5078
The patronage law originated from the early medieval property law .	-5.2611
A lord who built a church and occupied it with a parish remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church .	-6.4786
It was connected with the right to appoint a parish or to propose a new parish to the bishop .	-4.6542
Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .	-2.3421
The greater of the two crushed at Christmas 1673 .	-3.2067
The new embroidered bell then drove for the first time in 1692 , but had to be handed down later in the Second World War in 1942 .	-6.3817
During the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the windows were inscribed and the bell ropes were stolen .	-4.1787
The roof was dark .	-3.3493
In 1796 , French troops moved near the church .	-3.3015
They broke out the chancellor and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-3.3911
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-3.1571
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler .	-3.6075
The cemetery was extended in 1823 and the Hilariuskirche church was broken off .	-6.8023
Only the church tower was left to stand .	-3.2693
In the New Year 's Eve 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .	-4.7936
To prevent an accident , the tower was broken down .	-7.6733
Only the tower dwarf , which still exists today , was preserved as a witness to the 750 years of the church history .	-6.6779
Today , Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the " Schaffigen Rentnern " as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius facility .	-4.5764
As organiser , the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens invite to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday , July 16th , for the sixth serenade .	-5.6013
This is done by the Combo des Kepler-Gymnasiums Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-4.0433
The previous speaker , Hartmut Romann , speaks the final word .	-4.0422
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.9716
Discount is from 3.30 p.m.	-3.8978
For the execution of the Serenade , a rebuilding takes place in front of the cemetery .	-5.7169
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest " , the organizers present the fantastic view .	-5.2445
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-2.9093
The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius plant , which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler .	-4.6878
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens are particularly committed to the homecare , as confirmed by Serenade organizer Walter Martini .	-5.5075
Verein will allow windmills to be tested .	-4.6876
" Boisheim defends itself " is not a legal precondition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat .	-5.0376
The association " Boisheim defends itself " asked Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette .	-4.2545
It is illegal .	-1.3404
The association argues that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette , no wind turbines could have been approved , because at the time in Viersen , only a wind force concentration zone existed on the border with Schwalmtal .	-7.0315
Within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle , but at the same time the concentration zone eliminates wind energy use for the rest of the city .	-9.3540
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being " blocked " .	-6.5026
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan , the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formal error .	-7.4284
" Due to the lack of planning requirements , the approved approval certificate is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn " , said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim defends himself " .	-6.3443
Current state of affairs : The City Council decided once again the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer recess ; a district government approval is still pending .	-6.3865
Erkens : " This means that the granting of authorisation for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded " .	-6.3032
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.5069
" The corresponding letters have been received by Viersen County since last week , " explained a speaker .	-5.3195
The circle is taking the opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-4.3399
However , they probably do not result in the procedure being stopped .	-3.8720
In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court , the circle did not want to comment on the content of the arguments of the Boisheim Association on Thursday .	-6.1066
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200-meter-high windmills on an area at the Boisheimer Nette .	-4.1652
Last year , the company , in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved , concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare estate .	-5.8266
The four wind turbines are designed to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .	-5.5278
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-2.0753
Last summer , Viersens Stadtrat gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and to participate in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district .	-4.6317
Car and tractor crash together : Mrs dies in a terrible accident .	-5.8863
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel ( Rhein-Lahn-Kreis ) .	-3.9848
A woman was fatally injured in this .	-3.1114
Two more people were slightly injured .	-2.2881
The road remained closed for hours .	-2.9950
According to police data , a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich , with her car in the course of the accompanying journey , with her 53-year-old mother , was able to accompany the L 333 towards Bogel .	-7.1574
City and traders plan " home shoots " weekend .	-4.3469
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-3.4375
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract the inhabitants to the shopping mall in the city centre .	-6.1714
As the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the " home-shop " weekend is intended to raise the awareness of customers of the offers offered by their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods .	-8.3861
It is therefore planned to have a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .	-4.5115
In addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their training places .	-4.2142
In addition , the shops of the city centre should invite you to the " Midnight Shoppers " .	-6.1405
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the region .	-6.1181
In preparation are advertisements on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags that point to the weekend of action , so Christian König .	-4.6939
Municipality and Gewerbeverein cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-7.3365
In this way the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project " Attractive downtown " .	-5.4940
These include new offers such as the first " Active Day " to the Brunnenfest and sold Sunday , talks with all traders and hosts to make them participate actively .	-5.5778
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .	-3.6603
In addition , customer potential should be newly or re-opened .	-4.1879
This includes guests and tourists .	-3.0770
However , many locals would also have lost their sights when shopping .	-5.8559
In the end , everyone would have to contribute to revitalising the city centre - right up to landlords , businesses throughout the city and clubs .	-5.8045
It came to overcome lethargy with a network that partly spread , King had said in the spring .	-4.5589
Birgit Streich , head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , said that the third " home shopping day " in Germany , for the first time , involved five Thuringian cities .	-5.8652
In addition to Bad Langensalza these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-2.3577
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities ' , so strike .	-5.1734
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his or her purchasing behaviour can influence his or her direct environment .	-5.8060
Two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school	-3.7402
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .	-2.8147
New people have been injured .	-1.7482
Two people were killed in a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis and nine more were injured , some of them hard .	-3.8822
According to the fire brigade , a wounded person was in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) .	-4.2672
A person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion .	-3.1243
A missing person was later also born dead .	-4.5534
The dead were school employees .	-2.3940
As an accident , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .	-3.2647
There were few people in the Minnehaha Academy building at the time of the holiday .	-4.9234
Trump pressured Mexico for leaked transcripts of telephone calls , owing to the payment of the border wall .	-4.9201
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-2.3915
On January 27 , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , Trump called on him to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.2862
The US President insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall , and he reportedly said to him : ' You cannot say this to the press ' .	-5.3752
Trump launched his presidential campaign , promising to build a wall on the US southern border , and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.0865
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.9761
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US was " ridiculous " , " bad " , and " stupid " , and that the insistence on trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a " dump " after proposing a ban on resettling refugees to the US .	-6.0819
Mr Trump ended the call after he said to Mr Turnbull that ' this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-7.2433
Moores Ford Massacre : Activists resume racist Lynchakt as a call for justice .	-3.7367
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumped to the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-4.2819
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .	-3.3286
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windscreen .	-3.9717
Drinks floated the inmates in fear .	-4.4002
" We want this n ---- r Roger !	-3.4299
" Get him out of the car ! "	-2.1105
Shrine torn the silence when a young black man was torn apart by the front-passenger seat .	-3.3336
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a reflection .	-4.2365
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost all of the people in the audience beat out very real sigh .	-6.8468
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to emulate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lifted by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-4.0973
No one has ever been indicted for the murders .	-2.5737
" It is truly incomprehensible that in all these years not a single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organise the adjustment .	-5.4007
" It is a jewelry on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-3.4048
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights activist .	-3.8352
For him , rendition serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.0548
" We want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , " he said .	-3.2804
'We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-3.5564
A medical counselor puts a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Moore Order , on July 27 , 1946 .	-5.8692
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process .	-3.8727
But no one has ever been charged .	-1.7837
Although the suspects have been at large for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-5.1570
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer .	-4.3890
Roughly at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black Farmpächter Roger Malcom stamped a white landowner , Barnett Hester , while fighting down - allegedly because of a woman .	-4.9356
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom ’ s wife Dorothy , and that the baby she was wearing was not from her husband .	-4.2684
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-2.3211
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.2655
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynchmob surrounded the car .	-4.4879
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes a FBI report .	-2.6712
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses " .	-4.4502
Brooks makes it even more concise .	-2.7244
" It was an electoral law massacre , " he said .	-1.9218
'They have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and if you vote , that will happen to you here ' .	-4.5525
For nearly a decade , Cassandra Greene has led Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde ’ s annual rendition .	-3.9220
Their presentation is vivid , moving and is based on a kind of deep racism , many of which want to believe that it no longer exists in America .	-6.5653
It is hard to see , and more difficult to look away , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.9926
" We don 't want to talk about the lynch , because then we will be confronted with its severity in all of us , " she said .	-8.7217
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done " .	-3.7227
The rehearsals for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and loudly when Greene had a well-rehearsed overview of the piece started .	-6.5219
Wade Marbaugh is co-director here .	-2.0192
He has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-3.1421
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-2.0632
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-3.2022
On the other side of the room , actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried to play their lines .	-2.8604
The piece begins with Malcom , who attacks Hester and afflicts him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-5.2181
" I said n --- he , disappearing from my property ! "	-1.9317
Rascona warms up the fire .	-2.1522
There is a break .	-1.1338
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-3.0279
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.5286
" What ? " , asked Rascona .	-1.8576
It is alarmed and confused .	-1.1484
Was it too hard ?	-2.1380
" No , " Greene said , still kicking .	-2.3147
" I simply do not think that white people said ' n --- er ' at the time .	-3.8149
" But " , one of the other black performers joked .	-3.9545
'You only have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-5.1565
And just as energy shifts in space , a sense of comrade replaces unease .	-5.2432
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.1586
The scene begins again .	-1.3897
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it strongly and forcefully .	-5.6979
Nobody is laughing .	-2.3900
This repetition ends violent and fast .	-1.8786
There is horror , shots and then silence .	-2.5728
A woman with a mourning sorrow stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays mourning praise " Strange Fruit " .	-5.2194
Your vote breaks with every second word .	-3.1361
About a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators know about sweat and tears .	-5.7526
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .	-2.2999
A couple came from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the road .	-4.0069
They have experienced Georgian moisture for almost eight hours , when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys .	-5.9630
To this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels sprawling .	-6.1433
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name .	-4.1492
Children raise their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whisper each other .	-4.4829
" They are not really dead , " murmurs a little boy as if he wanted to remember .	-3.9807
After a few minutes , Greene thanked the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-2.7931
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wipe out their tears .	-2.8738
Bradshaw embraced Marbaugh , the man who played the clan member .	-3.2637
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her poor , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .	-4.4542
" It is okay " , whispers one of the women .	-1.6716
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.8359
You did so for one reason . '	-1.9784
Later , the audience met the actors for dinner .	-4.7902
On a table , a white pair of Atlanta shoots over the adjustment with a black pair that they have just met .	-7.6191
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that have left a feeling of performance .	-4.3420
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you yourself and who do this because they look like you , " she said .	-3.6305
" What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on " , she added , " today the only police shooter is called . "	-6.2845
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks Hof keeps his table , he eats and reminds citizens ' rights .	-4.1458
He said he had already started to plan the performance next year .	-2.6724
" The adjustment is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-7.0951
" It is the case that if we learn nothing from it , it can happen again .	-4.5344
Those who do not study their own history , those who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat it . '	-3.0965
" Goddess Dawn " reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth .	-3.4812
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf is also setting a colourful staging in front of gigantic , six-killer scenes .	-5.9393
The revolving stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) shows a shabby street corner , including Mauerrest and Dönerbude in Berlin , a " Plaste and Elaste " logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-5.4287
Before that , an open Mercedes-Oldtimer , in which the Rhine daughters pose as rockers , or alternatively , an Isetta , is parked .	-5.8349
Gestapelte Ölfässer recall Castorfs leitmotiv - money , power and greed - that moves through his " ring " staging .	-5.1287
The three Rheintöchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as they did in the " Rheingold " .	-3.9256
Kess seduces Siegfried ( Stefan Vinke ) , dragging a body into the trunk in Hollywood fashion and giving the Krawallo clique .	-5.1994
Stephen Milling sings the wonderful fiesen Hagen , who surrounds the aura of a swordsman .	-4.9342
Brutal the scene when he hit Siegfried .	-2.8842
Later , Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) must believe .	-3.5359
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .	-2.8665
Foster , Milling , Vinke and Dirigent Janowski , who humbly and moulds his hands to the Merkel-Raute , are celebrated with dreadful .	-7.9910
Great applause is given to the festival orchestra , which is showing itself for the first time on the stage - in the face of the great heat again in a more sophisticated leisure dress .	-8.9326
The performance was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his director .	-3.5984
In 2013 , he still had to go through a leaning pipe concert , and five years later there was great cheer in which the isolated " Buh " cries fell .	-9.1911
Katharina Wagner , the director of the festival , is likely to have been pleased about this .	-7.6313
" It is noted that the audience has in some way grown together with the " Ring " , " she said just before the performance of dpa .	-6.1526
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but also grew an understanding of his view .	-4.1298
I draw a positive conclusion .	-2.2975
Max Menge works as a volunteer .	-1.9855
They work in their voluntary year in several places .	-3.7857
Where everywhere ?	-0.5786

It can be done from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .	-4.9218
It was very varied with me . .	-6.3973
I was also partly in the UCITS , in other words in afternoons .	-3.8836
For me , that was exactly the right thing to do .	-4.3734
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .	-3.1824
Unlike in the study of building engineers ?	-3.9248
Menge : Na klar , hier geht es nicht darum , Statiken auszurechnen .	-2.5309

Very interesting .	-0.5700
And you had no fear of touch ?	-3.1396
Lots : I am not the type for this .	-3.3562
It is an area that gives a lot .	-2.8719
Much love , much kindness .	-5.4180
There are also some negative moments , but so life is just that .	-7.0702

EPA reverses the decision to delay the Smog rule after complaints .	-3.7640
The US Environmental Protection Agency has revoked a decision to delay regulation of Obama ’ s administration , which requires states to curb Smog-caused emissions , one day after 15 states sue the agency for the move .	-6.8589
The EPA late on Wednesday announced the decision to push ahead with the so-called ' ozone provisions 2015 ' and said it shows the Agency 's commitment to work with states .	-5.5088
" We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , " said EPA-Chef Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.6210
In June , Pruitt announced the EPA ’ s intention to measure the ozone rules – in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country , in order to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards – to delay one year by October 2018 .	-6.8125
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal .	-3.4143
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to cut off a broad range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump claims to boost economic growth .	-5.1332
Efforts have , however , triggered the setback of the Democrats and nature conservation groups that worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health .	-5.4474

Community area	-1.6135
In the end , the decision was clear : with two votes against , the Municipality of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a Community area in the future Senior Citizens ' Residence .	-6.0016
Before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing part of the property was signed , reported by Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-5.1874
Although it will take some time before the church parish is part of the municipal council , there is no longer any planning hindrance for the project to be stamped by a private investor .	-8.8103
There is a discussion on a Community area .	-5.1321
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .	-3.2716
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price .	-4.1504
The administration and the majority of the municipal council propose that such a common area should not be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of senior-just housing , but open to the community .	-7.4747
As an example , the word " Strickcafé " made the round .	-3.7746
The decision taken last autumn by allocating funds to the current budget will be omitted by means of funding .	-6.2513
The building is located in the rehabilitation area .	-3.0998
The establishment of a Community area would , according to Tjaden , be eligible for funding at 60 % of 30 % .	-5.0637
The proposal for a decision provides for a signal to be sent to the investor that , in this respect , he does not want to throw a stick between the legs , stating that both saddle - which is modelled on ambient construction - and pultdach - which reduces the grape level and makes the construction of economic power possible .	-8.6438
Needless to say , not only does Wilfried Sohmer think that is this addition .	-5.3464
If it helps : unanimity , it happens to the body .	-4.8071
It is not as easy as the Community area .	-3.8678
Daniela 's reputation refers to the many own buildings with which we do not make such progress , for which we are now rejecting the Community space from the window , she says : ' I am struggling ' .	-8.7705
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against communal participation .	-4.0441
It sees a hidden subsidy to already-wealthy or even foreign investors .	-6.0719
That is not the case , because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant , but gives a real counterpoint , in case of doubt marketable .	-8.1749
There are three supporters of the Staigers motion to split up the draft decision accordingly .	-5.6494
Thus , with two votes against the original programme summarised by Stefan Haller , ' if we take the decision in this way , we will be taking a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-6.1130

This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg .	-2.6560
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-3.3221
A " Star Path " meets the information needs of many visitors to Harzbesucher , it was said .	-5.5256
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-3.3655
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-5.2520
In a first phase until 2018 , the association plans " well-attainable installations in five to six places " in Oberharz .	-4.8806
Infrage would come from St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeiß and Sieber .	-3.0109
The information on the panels should be supplemented by the Internet .	-4.3082
Therefore a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .	-4.7191
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-2.1163
Later , the Star Trap train is to be extended by train .	-5.1454
" The observer will learn a lot of interesting facts about the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-6.6608
They also learned why stars have different colors , or why a star brightens more than another , even though it is much further away .	-5.2341
It also mediates in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see .	-5.6231
Since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg , the highest situated observatory in northern Germany . the mountain , , , the mountain .	-11.2183

The earth shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away sun measures 70 centimetres .	-5.0395
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres .	-4.0738
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to stele with pluto .	-4.5790

" I am a former featherweight , " Garcia recalled .	-3.0609
" I grew up for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.8079
I am small for 140 .	-0.8044
I want to get down to weight .	-3.0327
And he must move on lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.4501
That is what the fans are asking for . , , is .	-5.4495
Let us give them that . '	-1.6833
Lomachenko agreed .	-1.0307
'Boxes need this fight ' .	-2.3125

Four injured at Reifenplatzer	-2.7718
In an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .	-3.5504
According to initial information , the rider of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the terminal market width probably after a tyre burner .	-6.6555
The car dragged to the right into the Böschung , where it was flooded and then remained on the roof in the green strip .	-6.8667
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .	-2.2116
During the initial rescue of the injured , the A7 was closed to the north for about one hour , and then the traffic on the left was transferred to the accident site .	-7.8822
Fortunas Hoffmann : " Dreierkette works better " .	-2.3112
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 season run against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue points .	-3.9159
With the first season game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , too , would not have been the two countertores at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-6.1449
" These were two backdoors too much , and we have to be even more careful in Aue " , says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.1896
In the Erzgebirge the triangle is to be further optimized .	-4.6983
And a gateway after a free ride , the fortunes no longer want to enter .	-6.8792
" For the future , it will be the case that no one will take the line next to Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-4.7491
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better even after the experience in preparation with the triangle chain than with the four-range .	-8.2059
" I do not yet know how we will act in Aue , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have just in the triangle on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-5.4591
" The prerequisite is that we harmonise even better and that we do not make so many mistakes in the construction " .	-7.2814
Of course , Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-2.9676
" But you don 't know whether you can talk about a failed start after a decision .	-5.2158
The performance could well be okay , " Hoffmann said .	-3.5331
" If , however , we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season break . "	-6.9006
His trainer did not want to know anything about this .	-3.2405
" I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the match of Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm .	-6.4838
" Now they can almost start the season with a home game , " Funkel and Hoffmann said that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher , because they don 't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing favorites in the bones .	-7.2718
" But they don 't know exactly where they are at the moment , " says Fortuna 's defender .	-5.1672
Although the guests from the Rhineland are going to the meeting in Aue ’ s final ( almost ) stadium as a light favourite on Sunday .	-8.3077
" That we sweep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is nonsense , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is very positive in the defeat against Aue from nine games .	-6.6930
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which must be beaten in advance " , says Fortuna 's chief coach .	-4.8434
" Such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant " .	-2.9479
And so Funkel doesn 't want to experience his players on Sunday .	-4.7388
New results of the Swedish asylum age assessment tests	-3.9686
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are over 18 years old , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-5.2579
The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) started carrying out the tests last year .	-3.7394
During the asylum procedure , they should be more precise in assessing the age after the Swedish migration authority ( migration sale ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage .	-7.6226
To date , migration sales have sent 6,880 cases to be tested , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-3.9491
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person " was possibly 18 years or older " .	-6.2042
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years old " .	-2.0163
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-3.0746
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been steady over the past few months .	-5.1472
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.5175
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age .	-3.4055
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that " suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older " .	-3.5340
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the 581 published results , it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-3.9910
The method of medical age assessment , in which X-ray measurements of Weisheitszähnen and MRT recordings of knee joints are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-6.3757
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went sooner or later than usual through puberty .	-4.1691
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.7979
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.8723
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend that we could ' , he told the newspaper Metro .	-3.7595
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low .	-3.3832
The greatest risk lies in the fact that the person is under 18 , in this case approximately 10 % . '	-5.3153
Complete in the Plan	-1.6125
Work on the three bridges on the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-3.3308
On Wednesday , a seven tonnes heavy concrete part was installed at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-4.0584
" We are very good at the time , it runs super " , says Reinhold Leicht , construction manager at the department of road and traffic in the government-presidium Freiburg .	-5.9836
In April , the work started at the same time on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-4.2390
The end of the construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is adhered to .	-9.1811
Coming from Schramberg , the first bridge leads across the Trombach .	-3.2302
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red brick and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-5.5601
It was built in 1900 .	-1.4715
Like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .	-3.7663
In order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .	-4.9721
The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach .	-5.9039
They are built from a reddish stone .	-4.4689
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 , or 10.60 metres long .	-2.9490
The Lauterbach bridge at the entrance to the village has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tonnes heavy so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning .	-6.4311
This is a marginal attachment , which is also used as an operating path .	-4.8662
On Friday the southern part of the bridge is to be used a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap .	-5.6207
The pedestrian route is to be followed .	-4.9487
The particular thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo .	-4.7346
The other two bridges are already covered with patented bridge caps .	-2.6622
Particular care has been taken to lay lines through the Lauterbach building .	-6.3326
There is also a glass fibre cable , to which many companies are connected .	-4.7366
The local residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by hand .	-8.1933
In addition , fish and cancer had to be fished first .	-2.9887
For bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .	-5.4370
For construction work on the bridge at Lauterbach entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " is completely locked .	-5.7432
The cost of the three bridge renovations is combined with EUR 700 000 .	-3.8012
It is financed by the country .	-2.2509
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protest bei deutschem Kartoffelsalat .	-1.6494

The parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , Left ) represented in the Vulkaneifel district are part of a broad alliance that shows peacefully flag this day , because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the " big campaign " poster .	-6.8331

The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , and they show a presence , especially at the station , which is only a few metres from the venues .	-9.4405
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-2.5927
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he had made an effort to organize this event and got the award .	-6.3016
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun , but got a cancellation there because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes not enough parking spaces are available .	-6.1509
So now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a beautiful event here " .	-3.4660
Looking at the event on Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.3014
This is also the case : at around 20 o 'clock , a band will take care of entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz , in the city hall of various speakers , including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD-Chairman Uwe Junge .	-8.0847
There are about 200 listeners in the Chamber waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the Deputy Chairman , Beatrix von Storch , to deliver their speeches .	-6.1567
The police presence has not changed , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.3103
The AfD event takes about an hour , the guests on the pitch have a longer breath , but there , too , is scheduled shortly after 21 o 'clock .	-8.0587

The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party .	-3.0809
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party .	-2.7837
Whether you like it or not , the Democrats have moved away from me , " said Governor Justice .	-2.3037

Coe praises " honest " Russian apology for doping scandal	-2.1528
The global leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday what he described as a blatant apology from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be reinstated in sport .	-4.4062
Russia ’ s athletic leader , Dmitry Shylakhtin , said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World athletics Championships that his country ’ s ban from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .	-4.9053
He said that he felt sorry for " all athletes who have been squeezed away in competitions of gold and silver medals " .	-5.8661
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found references to state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.0388
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-2.4197
" The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realised that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned . "	-4.9829
Coe said he was also " pleased " that Russia accepts the criteria for its reintroduction .	-3.5753
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to restore Russia , " said Coe .	-6.2510
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation .	-2.9684
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the deceased system , " he added .	-3.0989

Trauerakt für in Mali abgestürzte Soldaten .	-2.4585
During a ceremony in Fritzlar , Northern Hesse , around 1000 people were thinking about a helicopter crash in Mali .	-5.3342
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security precautions .	-3.3943
Defense Minister Ursula of the Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing about the unresolved crash .	-4.2309
She described the two pilots who were killed but as " experts of her profession " .	-7.1625
" We bow to this highest sacrifice which they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she explained .	-4.4234
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from Nordhessen died a week ago in West African Mali on Wednesday .	-3.5557
Their saws were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a German Armed Forces Totenwache in the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter .	-5.6223
At midday , only the relatives in the church took leave .	-5.7097
After that , the ceremony began in the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics .	-5.5779
Among them were Hesse 's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker .	-3.4385
Sadly , roses laid down , and the families stood in arms at the coffins .	-8.2795
In front of the church , Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .	-3.4419
Secretary of Defense of the Leyen called the killed soldiers " highly decorated " and experienced .	-5.1364
The Stabshauptmann built the airship of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar with one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regime .	-5.9323
Volker Bauersachs , the commander of the regime to which the soldiers belong , also said : " If this occupation could not avert the fall , then no one would have liked it " .	-6.3966
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Leyen : the deployment is dangerous .	-3.6881
But it is also of great importance ' to a country from which we are separated only by two states ' , she said .	-4.1249
After the funeral , the saws were taken from the cathedral .	-8.1549
When and where they are buried , the Bundeswehr did not provide information on this .	-10.6653
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife .	-2.2721
The Danish Queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-3.0246
This divided the royal house on Thursday .	-4.0573
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple is placed in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-4.4279
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already finished a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.2574
The queen agreed with the decision of her husband , it was stated further in the communication .	-7.0073
Where Prince Henrik is buried , it is still unclear .	-2.7483
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .	-3.7398
Prince Henrik never had a secret from the fact that he was not happy with his title .	-3.2473
After the death of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .	-3.4713
In 2016 , he retired and also released the title " Prinzgemahl " .	-4.8501
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief spokesman of the Danish royal house .	-6.5731
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be , it is still unclear .	-4.2630
However , he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .	-3.9301
He likes the country for which he has worked over the last 50 years .	-1.9995
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat , son of a French noble family , met Margrethe in London in 1965 .	-2.5972
He worked on the theme in the French Embassy .	-2.9811

In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark : " A few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticized .	-7.2207
My Danish was volatile , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of knitting socks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-3.3536

Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election	-2.6140
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony	-2.3253
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red-green majority of government , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country ’ s day , but he does not want to resign .	-6.0256
Because on Friday , Parliament was in favour of disbanding .	-4.5113
Previously , the surprising departure of a Green MP from her country faction in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .	-4.9905
Five months before the official date of the country election , the Red / Green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow single-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-9.4109
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-4.2701
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-7.4745
CDU leader Björn Thümler is recommending that his group include them .	-3.5837
This means that CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag , SPD and Green 68 seats .	-4.5628
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-2.1906
The new Landtag will be elected on 14 January next year .	-4.0475
Thümler said that the rot-green government must now decide whether it can continue to rule in this situation without a majority .	-4.2889
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the day of the land should be resolved as quickly as possible .	-5.9002
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is expected to decide on its future on Tuesday .	-3.3450
The constitution of the country also provides for the possibility that the country 's day will deprive the prime minister of confidence and elect a successor .	-5.9613
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.7906
These possibilities must be legally examined ' , said Thümler .	-3.8908
'All questions will be discussed calmly if they are legally considered properly . '	-5.2547
Thümler called Twestens Schritt " doch etwas kurios " .	-1.5033
The politician herself stressed : ' I am not a traitor .	-3.1810
I feel very good ' .	-1.3822
She called herself an advocate of black green .	-4.6116
The Greens asked the breakaway Members to return their country 's mandate .	-4.3995
" We assume , of course , that they shared with their country-day mandate , which they received via the green list , with immediate effect " , the state leaders Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-7.5311
The group chairmen of the Greens , Anja Piel , said : ' We regret the decision by Elke Twesten ' .	-4.3433
She deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group .	-3.3435
" Even in the light of the lack of substantive differences , we cannot understand this step . "	-4.2829
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Dutch Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-4.2188
" The behaviour of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate , but also betrayal of the Red Green , " wrote the Social Democrats leader on Friday on Facebook .	-5.5859
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to have the country 's day quickly re-elected .	-4.5953
The exit Twestens costs the majority Rot-Grün in Lower Saxony .	-3.8300
The politician " in her hurt vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country " , SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticised .	-4.2357
" It is scandalous that the CDU , in Lower Saxony , is involved in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to capitalise on it " .	-5.3587
Lower Saxony CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his fellow Members that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU .	-4.0301
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of distorting the outcome of the 2013 election with personal careers .	-4.8525
At the time , the CDU was the strongest force before the SPD , but the SPD and the Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the country 's day .	-6.4255
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.8087
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-1.4793
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.3326
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.2152
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in interview with the German ( RND ) editorial network .	-3.8247
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.4821
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .	-3.6723
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information on the respective egg charts .	-5.0067
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.8728
Although , as we know at the moment , health risks are virtually excluded .	-4.5903
Is Aldi now taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs from the offer - because the central role of enlightenment is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs ?	-6.0426
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states .	-2.7679
Nevertheless , my House has immediately opened itself up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since Germany became aware of this .	-6.9705
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.2577
Trade , like manufacturers , has to ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe to health .	-4.6698
If the maximum residue content of 0,005mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , they are not transportable .	-5.0280
However , unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed .	-2.7525
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-2.6721
Do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?	-2.8991
According to current knowledge , production companies are not directly responsible .	-4.4785
On the contrary , they must expect economic damage because of the alleged illegal practices of service companies .	-5.0976
As always , there are too few inspectors in the worst case .	-3.6247
Is it just a matter of staff or a matter of coherent competence ?	-5.8956
After all , it was the official controls that revealed the matter .	-4.3891
The truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 % .	-3.0718
It is precisely for this reason that it is vital to ensure that such events are properly investigated and that public prosecutors are handed over in cases where crimes can be committed .	-7.5071
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide a complete explanation .	-4.5361
Is there really a need for regular alarm bells in the case of food scandals ?	-4.8333
Consumers have the right to obtain food that is safe and safe only .	-3.5184
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-3.8216
The amount of money that has been allocated has led to manufacturers , dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-7.0931
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the attitude of food suppliers is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-4.6562
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .	-3.6056
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and consistently .	-4.3554
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-3.7117
The rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars ’ world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain , Spain .	-7.9516
Something that will have consequences for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA , because the leading organisation that supervised the European game has the power to prohibit teams from accessing the prestigious Champions-League tournament .	-5.3102
Financial Fair Play rules that were created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses .	-5.1988
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several $ 10 million a year .	-4.0716
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France .	-1.8357
PSG can certainly loosen the money to sign Neymar and bring him to a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar .	-5.9193
clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but must counteract legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break even in their soccer business .	-5.7892
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.6911
Former French players believed that clubs that had taken on enormous debt in their quest for success effectively defrauded and risked ruining when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-4.7115
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.0729
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter .	-3.7363
During the current three-year FFP adjustment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .	-4.1548
And , though Platini fell into disgrace in 2015 from the presidency , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , remains committed to discouraging excessive spending .	-3.4918
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.4745
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum , it may distribute the amount for the billing of the duration of its contract .	-4.6806
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption fee for the next five years can be expelled to the tune of EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts .	-6.5116
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .	-3.1748
The PSG received a fine of € 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 championships league remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .	-4.9954
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outlist their financial supervision by blowing up their revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club .	-5.9845
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates , UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income .	-4.8783
That is exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.9490
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments made by the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup .	-4.4438
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have contested that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could easily be found .	-5.5341
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.8863
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.1563
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.9420
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.2485
The accounts for the last fiscal year still have to be published .	-2.9087
PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising and jersey sales .	-3.6274
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after the signing .	-7.7019
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players , and it tried to prevent Neymars from moving by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.6471
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the president of the La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's eventual ownership of PSG .	-3.0933
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is owned by an American sports team , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .	-3.7214
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.1144
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.3895
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play , because different paths can be taken or different interests can be found when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-5.3324
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggilist .	-4.2615
In recent years , Chocolat Frey Bord-Schokolade has produced Swiss .	-3.8697
Now there is a possible end to cut-throat cooperation : the airline is rewriting the order .	-6.6627
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper " Nordwestschweiz " from Friday .	-3.5993
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.4121
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-3.4857
" With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied , " said the speaker .	-2.8740
Some 17 million small rotweiss packed chocolate boxes to 14 grams per year distribute the cabin crew before landing to passengers .	-6.9005
The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs .	-3.4544
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to " Northwest Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros-Tochter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs .	-5.0462
But the advertising effect is all the more important : it is a prestigious order for a shoggihersteller .	-4.8754
The Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants there are for the new tender .	-5.1670
However , only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-3.3084
According to the newspaper , Chocolat Frey wants to renew the treaty beyond spring 2018 .	-3.3058
For sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-3.4343
Chocolate dishes have been distributed by Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .	-4.0860
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migro ’ s daughter , Barry Callebaut , in collaboration with Hug , had delivered the chocolate tablets .	-4.1334
The opportunity to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.7906
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.4581
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are pampered by Confiserie Sprüngli , Business Class naschen Passagiere Schoggi von Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey .	-4.5797
Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short-haul route , both in business and economy class .	-4.5108

His brother Christoph , the 2016 Olympic Champion , failed in the national World Cup draw and could only look at the discus competition from the grandstand .	-5.7916
Also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski , who threw 65.13 meters far , qualified for the final fight .	-4.7752
Nostalgie goes into " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " into the niche .	-2.3898
This repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 's , for the 90 's Grunge-era ( when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things .	-5.2100
As a cultural artefact , it is also a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook enabled era of permanent memories .	-3.0087
But as a franchise , it feels like time is running out .	-2.6357
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a speaking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.3783
By hiding at the heart of the gag , middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they still managed to win back the last part of the joke .	-7.9774
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting cannon principle , including a reef to the stalker movies of the 90s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The hand that the cradle looks like " ) .	-6.1381
At one point , a character by an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates , and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.4628
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.2466
The loving Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now novelist , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-2.8213
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.7907
And there is another crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-4.8915
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-2.9472
It ’ s a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillon ’ s Unterlippenbart of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knight .	-9.5515
It 's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until it reaches what I assume as its logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the bands how they will visit the movie premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-5.8904
" Comrade Detective " in Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War by " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East-West Ringkampf-Ikonographie .	-4.3811
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism .	-4.2541
The main roles are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose Channing Tatum dialogues ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English are synchronized .	-7.3941
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.2169
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.3466
There are some beautiful gags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-3.9910
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game ' Find the voice out ' .	-2.7718
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .	-3.3665
At six long episodes , it drags on , and the comedy is not fast or often .	-7.4493
" Comrade Detective " , which has been redirected to a lesser length , could deliver its Agitprop saddle better , as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers .	-7.0567
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything feed for a gelage .	-3.8848

Killing Drug Mafia in the Land	-4.1710
The police have managed to strike the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-6.1375
On Wednesday morning many objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar circle , in Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday .	-4.7776
15 suspects were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 and arrest warrants have already been issued against them .	-4.3500
Moreover , officials ensured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine , firearms , and several hundred thousand euros .	-3.2515
At the same time , two people were arrested in Italy .	-2.6990
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italians .	-2.3449
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany .	-3.1247
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.2170
More than 300 police officers were deployed .	-2.7019
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder and robbery and blackmail .	-4.0630
Since the summer of 2016 , the prosecutor ’ s office has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-4.0932
Between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a rainy exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-7.9564
Therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large-scale deployment was also accompanied by four Palermo officials .	-6.1507
Ins Visier of the investigation primarily drew Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia .	-6.2838
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the account of the bands .	-4.9862
In this way , there are major gaps in the Foreign Register .	-5.8756
" Data from citizens who should not appear there " : according to a report , the Foreign Register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-5.5726
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-3.4226
According to a media report , the Federal Government ’ s representative for refugee management , Frank-Jürgen Weise , drew attention to major gaps in the Foreign Central Register .	-5.2079
Deficits in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures and deportations , " warned in an analysis presented by the " Süddeutsche Zeitung " .	-6.4839
According to the register , ten million people of foreign nationality are registered , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.5019
The data are thus managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.6026
Because the data had not been properly maintained , the quality of data in parts has not been good .	-7.2751
In individual cases , data from 1921 have been found ' by people who have not been alive for a long time or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register ' .	-5.9858
" Errors in data input can significantly slow return processes " , says the report .	-4.4585
The statistics on people with emigration include EU citizens who would not have to leave at all .	-6.1036
However , such false allocations led ' to a distorted debate on the handling of emigration sufferers ' , so it is stated in the analysis .	-6.9740
Meanwhile , the federal government seems to have started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children when they arrived there .	-4.6469
This is shown in an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-4.2599
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is carrying out such procedures with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 .	-6.5894
Since the end of 2014 , this has virtually been impossible , according to the newspaper , referring to the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.7082
According to the Dublin Agreement , the EU State is responsible for refugees that they first reach .	-4.8941
If a migrant travels to another EU country , the state can return it to the country of entry .	-3.8856
To justify this , the office now writes : ' In the meantime , the absorption capacity for families with minors in Italy has increased substantially ' .	-6.5387
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.3543
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.2407
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement .	-3.1800
The domestic spokesman of the left-wing faction in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : ' Families with children are threatened by inadequacies in the Italian asylum system with inhuman conditions of reception and a threat to the child 's welfare ' .	-6.9446
The second result has been achieved .	-2.9392
In total , 220 litres of blood from persons living in Oberreichenbach already provided blood donation services to other people .	-4.4133
At least the twelve citizens who were awarded the prize on Friday .	-4.4228
Jürgen Greule , first of all , who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .	-5.9015
Traditionally , at the meeting of the municipal council , the community pays tribute to the multiple readiness to donate blood .	-5.9772
" It is ingenious how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the donors who make their blood available to strangers , and also to this unselfish " , underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.8286
" A single blood donation helps several people " , explained the District Leader of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the cannons are broken into their components .	-5.6678
Three people could benefit from blood donation .	-3.9303
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach .	-4.6110
" This year , we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK District Leader .	-4.1073
Obviously , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .	-4.5635
Even before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 donations of blood each .	-4.3844
Half the number of Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spent ten times per 500 milliliters of their life juice .	-3.8504
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 % .	-1.0507
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and a slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about an increase .	-3.5305
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it kept interest rates on family income in the midst of increased pressure .	-4.5400
Monetary Committee ( MPC ) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members this month seeking an increase , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-5.4554
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % , and 1.6 % for 2018 , warning that pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-4.1613
But they signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the next few years to rein in the inflation fueled by Brexit , saying that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.4572
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth stimulus package issued a year after Brexit .	-3.6758
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - GBP 115 billion sterling .	-5.1961
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the MPC 's central forecast , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on household real incomes continues to strain consumption . "	-5.3403
At interest rates , she repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be necessary to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' level than the markets expect .	-4.7568
Markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.6104
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-2.5009
The Bank ’ s downward adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next are 1.9 % and 1.7 % projected in May .	-3.5659
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.2855
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .	-2.5415
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 , falling by 0.4 % to $ 1.11 .	-2.0720
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an increase in interest rates and GDP increased from 0.2 % in the second quarter of the previous three months to 0.3 % .	-5.2823
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year .	-3.7909
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage increases , as tightening will become even worse before it improves .	-5.3839
It added that , over the next few years , monetary policy cannot ' prevent ' the loss of income , but it added that wages will recover significantly at the end of their three-year forecast .	-5.1232
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending .	-3.8765
The decision comes one year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .	-3.9118
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for that to fully reach prices and the economy .	-3.5214
Before the Bank ’ s last verdict on interest rates , the call for an interest-rate hike increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-4.4952
Inflation fell from 2.9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that it was expected to do so and that it will rebound in the coming months .	-4.6088
The Bank said that exceeding the 2 % target is " very " to the weak pound .	-4.5285
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders are eager to look for deals and end the year in a positive way .	-5.6237
The market is particularly good for those who end the existing deals and complete the new mortgages , and many with zero-fee options and low rates are becoming more popular . '	-5.7000
NHS ( National Health Service ) is said to prescribe disputed HIV threats to 10,000 people .	-3.8841
Patients will be given access to a ' transformative ' HIV prevention treatment from September onwards following a fight against the High Court to finance the drug in the NHS .	-6.2379
NHS England announced that a pre-sexual preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , will now be delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people .	-5.8518
He agreed to fund the process after last year ’ s appeal court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-5.1766
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens as an " important new intervention , " while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a " decisive moment .	-8.6915
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and further clinics will follow in October before they will be introduced across England in April 2018 .	-3.9566
Preexpositional prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-4.2369
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infectious risk .	-3.2833
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.7177
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-2.9773
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals , and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully .	-3.4341
In clinics , appropriate participants identified who agree with the study , including men , women , transgenders , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.9824
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-7.8682
The program will be signed £ 10 million and NHS England a contract to deliver the medication this week after an international competitive procurement .	-3.9425
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as is targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.7158
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.4207
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity 's greatest health challenges . '	-7.9566
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.2173
PrEP , if it is targeted at people in need and at risk , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-5.0451
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner that will improve many , many lives .	-4.9530
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.5216
Ian Green , CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to carry out the study quickly across the country and to leave no one who has a risk to HIV .	-4.1207
Now that PrEP dentistry has been procured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-4.1309
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of government delay and hesitant implementation .	-3.6426
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be , as part of our approach to HIV prevention , and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.4438
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-2.3321
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help to bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society .	-4.8218
The great life lives : the mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-4.5147
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , declined from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-2.5753
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-2.9746
" Before that I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space , " says Joanne .	-2.2053
" I looked for something that was comparable to my price .	-2.6126
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-2.6811
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . '	-3.0935
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken .	-3.3290
Originally a one-room property with a nestled layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add space and an intermediate level to make the most of the generous ceiling levels .	-5.5544
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.8638
That was my request ' , she says .	-2.6796
To this end , she commissioned the architect and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.0529
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate level where one could stand .	-4.0809
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-2.1647
" The steel mill is rather complicated " , he explains .	-3.0911
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on each other without having to fill us .	-5.5051
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of creating the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . "	-7.5519
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other in full height - with much more drama .	-5.3371
For the mezzanine floor , a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area .	-4.3826
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.4832
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.8815
At both ends , a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer .	-3.8545
In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room .	-3.2636
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-4.4423
By perceiving a glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.7794
Combinable kitchens are nothing new .	-2.1362
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-3.0115
" A bit of engineering art went there " , explains Erfan of the stahlverstärkten , furnished MDF door .	-4.1214
" It is counterproductive , so when you push the door , it is very easy to slip . "	-5.2775
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne gained an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.9073
" At the end of the day you will sell the floor - or as your property is estimated " , says Erfan .	-3.4739
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . "	-4.2032
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.2354
" The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-2.8973
" You don 't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls .	-3.8833
They are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.1465
It shows that a flat can be transformed into something quite amazing by good design and increased square meters .	-5.0881
Indeed , like Joanne , you could choose not to leave them .	-2.3401
Brothers are fighting for $ 500 million in real estate .	-2.5602
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a dispute over one of the largest real-estate empires Victorias worth more than $ 500 million .	-7.0617
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared .	-4.7471
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-4.7492
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family bought a deal in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-3.2585
There , the Westco Jeans family founded a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.3282
It was sold in 1999 for USD 85 million .	-1.6531
This money has been invested in real estate , and De Lutis 's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .	-6.4405
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - has about two-thirds of corporate assets and Paul about one-third .	-5.3338
A court act says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million worth of property and $ 176 million worth of Paul .	-3.5693
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.4903
" The departments proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects , " he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015 .	-3.1417
Last Friday , after several failed mediations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.8797
The brothers are now also fighting to control the existing business – Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled out .	-4.6036
Colin argues that this is not true , but Paul pretends to manage some possessions incompetent .	-5.7844
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-3.3229
" My Italian legacy dictates that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.8448
The costs rise in the case of hundreds of pages of Affidavits , e-mails and reports of companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-4.2381
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-4.3220
They used the security to buy the Collingwood estate in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family .	-3.9313
Colin says that he began there when he was " in my last years the High School when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-4.3579
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons amicably .	-2.7747
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , " she wrote .	-2.2820
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis Group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when leaving the company .	-3.5654
Both Luke and Mark , Paul says , " have become embittered by the conditions of their financial separation . "	-4.7451
Colin resigned very much , though he was a former AFL board member and , after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , was the best friend of the TV star .	-5.2018
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.7224
Only Colin responded by SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case is before the courts .	-2.9725
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.6724
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands .	-2.5592
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.6576
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.5029
" Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts , " wrote Colin .	-2.5832
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstention .	-5.4597
Others have tried and failed .	-3.4426
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .	-2.1259
If so , it will be the first .	-1.3771
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the chief on a more equal footing .	-4.1468
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.3162
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met with senior executives on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that came into the hands of the president .	-4.6151
Kelly said to the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he received good information . '	-4.6565
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.6655
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.4704
" If candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of posts to be persuaded , " said former campaigner Sam Nunberg in February vis-à-vis Politico .	-5.2168
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady price of praise . "	-3.6430
Okay .	-0.8840
But the idea that Trump 's Twitter habit has ever been " under control " is ridiculous .	-2.0270
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know to others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions .	-4.3318
We will probably never hear anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.6324
If his staff managed to keep him out of trouble several times , their efforts have been rewarded .	-4.5901
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from generating controversy .	-2.4812
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing parties , people are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.5893
Politico - all of this history - reported in May about the preference of advisers to give the President questionable information for strategic reasons .	-6.1559
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.5338
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with disgraceful leaks , and that he is hiding to find out where they come from .	-6.1606
This is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the source behind a bunch of leaks in the White House .	-5.2996
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment , or that he did not provide concrete evidence , or that he had made false accusations in the past and revoked them .	-6.0425
Trump read the article and began to ask Walsh staff . "	-3.1232
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Secretary-General , Rob Porter , have " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram Trump receives . "	-4.5072
How did this work ?	-1.5423
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-1.5810
Perhaps he will prove himself to be more effective manager than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-3.8633
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.4031
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol	-2.6668
As the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped .	-4.1732
This summer , the police across Europe are sending postcards to dangerous criminals .	-4.1303
As the addresses of the sword criminals in question are not known by nature , indications from the population are hoped and requested .	-10.5411
On Friday , Europol reported on the action following the ' EU Most Wanted ' Advent Calendar of Winter .	-3.9493
Experience has shown that many fleeing holiday destinations are hidden , as Europol said .	-4.3311
There are 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries .	-4.2216
Since 2016 , the www.eumostwanted website has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .	-2.7494
36 of the online enquiries have so far been arrested , at least eleven of them on the Internet , on the basis of indications after publication .	-7.3056
Travellers negotiate a tomb and return to the Millions series .	-3.4597
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are again at war with some determined travellers who have negotiated a tomb drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions .	-6.7673
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the " Millionaire series " .	-3.8956
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters with them after they were thrown out in May , but without being deterred by a burial excavated by the Council in order to prevent their deaths .	-5.9381
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unblocked to find a way .	-3.7393
Outraging residents have afflicted the Solihull Council , which said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-4.9297
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They went there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-4.4053
The Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it , because it was useless when dealing with the problem .	-4.1959
Travellers were there in May , moved forward and are now back .	-3.8509
More came yesterday evening , probably even more today . '	-2.8477
She added : ' The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with this by keeping long instructions to protect its parks .	-4.0959
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-2.9187
A resident who did not want to be called said : ' It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-4.5675
The figures have increased this time and we have even seen a horse in the parking area . '	-3.9388
A spokesman for the Solihull Council said : " We are aware of an unauthorised warehouse in the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls police , taking the necessary legal steps to move forward as quickly as possible .	-6.5777
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-2.9976
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . '	-4.1541
From Birkenhof , Waldhotel Luise becomes Waldhotel Luise .	-2.8897
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise .	-3.0196
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.4988
These are good news for the city .	-1.5958
After all , with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time , as well as revenue from the city tax .	-6.2092
In the autumn of 2014 , with the dramatic increase in the number of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the county council as a collective accommodation , creating controversial discussions .	-7.0969
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.2524
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council at the time .	-6.4487
But , above all , Freudenstadt ’ s mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel ’ s location and spoke of serious interests at the house at the time .	-7.1657
He should be right .	-1.7013
The group of Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-5.1363
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object .	-2.1455
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.3708
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.7164
At the former Hotel Birkenhof , building boot containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are being carried out .	-7.3958
The floors were torn out , the ceiling partly dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-5.2523
The entire hotel building is a single building .	-2.7591
There is still much to be done by March .	-2.0931
" It is actually a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.6818
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-3.5163
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned , new windows are installed .	-3.9048
Everything should become " beautiful bourgeois " as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-4.5843
" We want to make a jewel out of it . "	-3.8164
Swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are also available .	-4.9680
You don 't want to position yourself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but already at an upscale inner city level , Scherer emphasizes .	-6.2522
The Waldhotel Luise , with its 60 or so rooms , wants to set itself apart , explains Scherer .	-5.4359
Both individual holidaymakers , groups or businessmen should feel at home in the hotel .	-4.1698
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause have already led , Scherer said .	-4.1920
The city 's ideas are identical to those of the hotel .	-4.9966
" We are on the same line . "	-2.0758
Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise about the level of investment .	-4.0402
Nearly less than a million euros , he expects . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.9719
The exterior equipment is also being forged , which is already clearly visible .	-5.8822
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace , open from the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-5.1069
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.1958
Russia affair : US Special Envoy appointed Grand Jury .	-5.1319
In the Russo-American affair with US President Donald Trump , Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-7.4657
In recent weeks , the panel has begun work , and the Wall Street Journal wrote on behalf of familiar people .	-6.6082
The newspaper valued the move as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations .	-3.9768
The CNN station reported that there are already initial charges from the board in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-4.3716
US intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time of targeting itself in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-3.6500
Mueller investigates whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-3.0670
The investigation focuses on several men who acted as Republican advisers in the election campaign .	-4.5144
According to reports , Mueller also looked more and more closely at Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.0306
The " Washington Post " wrote a few weeks ago that the special counsel , Trump , personally focused on investigating whether the president might have obstructed the judiciary during the affair .	-6.7077
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether charges should be made .	-5.1093
Grand Jurys are therefore also referred to as detention centres .	-4.1080
They are mostly switched on when they are major and controversial cases .	-4.0584
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .	-1.8308
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to interrogate .	-4.8865
According to CNN , charges have already been issued to meet Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.0867
People involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , as the report said .	-4.7703
They should also provide documents .	-1.3690
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s adviser and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and his former campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were also present at the meeting .	-4.8800
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the investiture shows that Mueller is not intimidating in his work and that , if necessary , he wants to act quickly .	-5.4377
However , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end in order to decide on the collection of an indictment .	-5.4864
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-5.1352
In the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-3.6082
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-2.8495
The issue gives democrats a chance to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-4.0288
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.4841
But he also usually works in secret , he emphasized .	-5.5908
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Counsel in a ' fair ' way .	-4.3720
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president was not investigated .	-3.8656
There is no reason to assume that something has changed , as stated in the statement .	-5.1221
But Mueller was only deployed after Trump fired Comey .	-2.4369
Because of this smokescreen , accusations have been made against Trump that he wanted to impede the judiciary .	-6.0122
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser , Michael Flynn .	-3.7345
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.2000
According to the US media , the White House collected material against the Special Counsel and his associates .	-4.5709
That triggered speculation about whether Trump wants to dismiss Mueller .	-2.7271
Unlike an independent congressional special agent , such as the Watergate affair , around the later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the behest of the president .	-4.8884
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.9931
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented on Thursday draft legislation that would make it impossible for the special envoy to be dismissed so easily .	-9.3787
Antarctica : Giant Ice Mountain is driving in Antarctica .	-6.4490
In the West Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg of just under seven times the size of Berlin has been separated from the Schelfeis .	-5.8996
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research reported on Wednesday .	-3.8110
The colossus , which exceeds a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres , is now going north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-6.2831
It is 175 kilometres long and has a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .	-4.3572
It does not pose a threat to people .	-3.7264
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear according to research findings .	-4.4427
In total , however , there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice cuffs in the region for some 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-5.1808
According to many researchers , this can be linked to global warming .	-3.0175
The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-4.5322
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.7450
As a result , it is growing ever further into the sea and breaking off regularly .	-13.4024
Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-8.1087
North of this slap , the balance of guard and breakdown was disrupted a few years ago .	-4.9544
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete skeleton .	-4.9267
There is much to be said for the Larsen-C-Schelfeis to be at risk , because the front edge has never gone as far back as it is now .	-6.8506
In addition , the ice plate is under suspense and could collapse if a key point breaks off a piece .	-6.2145
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level , as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it produces after melting itself .	-5.2215
However , the loss of the slap means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .	-5.6703
This could possibly increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for monitoring the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-4.9826
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shark of Antarctica , according to AWI data of almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-5.3609
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-4.2674
This is where it breaks off regularly .	-4.6245
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of British Swansea University .	-4.1242
" This is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the records , " he also confirmed .	-3.2941
Among scientists , whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is going to grow again or go back in the long term and possibly fall together , his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-6.6972
But this development will take decades .	-1.9392
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , many Antarctic ice cuffs have fallen apart in recent decades .	-5.3753
This long neck of the Antarctic stretches towards South America .	-3.4557
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.6671
The rise in temperature contributed to the decline .	-3.2420
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees in the last 50 years and is therefore one of the areas where temperature is fastest .	-5.8077
CDU wants domestic rates at the personnel .	-4.9679
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies , the CDU is calling for employers to leave to become more attractive .	-4.4526
Only just before the summer break did the district day cast 41 new posts in the administration .	-8.9944
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in Mettmann .	-3.2422
Now 17 trainees have left behind their first working day .	-7.3550
It seems that the apprenticeships are very much .	-5.9329
Some 620 applications were available for the seats to be awarded this year .	-4.6593
However , the number of staff is still lacking in order to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .	-5.2534
At the moment there are still 50 unfilled jobs in Mettmann County .	-5.2316
Doctors and engineers , as well as general administration , are invited .	-5.7406
The CDU , together with the FDP and the UWG , now wants to take the initiative to counter the shortage of skilled workers in administration .	-5.0757
According to the desire of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for human resources and human resources development .	-11.1386
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals , but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in the future .	-5.9247
The overall concept should be orientated inward and outward , should provide concrete measures for cross-beginners and include a training offensive , demand CDU , FDP and UWG .	-6.1946
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.1108
For the circle has to do with personnel problems that were previously not known .	-6.1102
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.9142
There is talk of a genuine ' competition of public employers ' .	-3.5629
In addition , a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-4.7288
It is therefore high time to act so that there are no more posts left unfilled .	-5.9765
But Klaus-Dieter Völker , the CDU ’ s leader , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.6221
He recently brought a faustdicke surprise to the circle when he publicly called into question the capping of staff costs and surprised other parties .	-10.7308
Peoples want to see to it all the possibilities that leave the local employers ' association .	-5.8672
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , then the district administration , with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding towns - should strive for a domestic tariff , " says peoples .	-7.6896
In this way , the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the collective bargaining system actually provides for the public service .	-5.9328
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed , increases or more money are available only if you change to a higher level , which is oriented towards career years .	-6.8871
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown ever more in recent years .	-4.2115
Only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act .	-4.4154
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .	-3.6449
Italy Steps Up to NGO Migrant Rescue Boats	-3.1600
Italy has warned NGOs working to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations .	-4.4027
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa .	-3.2302
Minniti ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Save Agency because its team had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.9410
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to give its opinion on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor , Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.0469
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-4.7278
" We can only judge all the accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation . "	-5.2427
The Italian authorities had monitored the ' Youth Rettet ' boat , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.9085
It is suspected that his crew is taking mud boat migrants on board , delivered directly to them by human traffickers , and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be reused .	-6.6235
At least such a meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media .	-4.6336
The occupation is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian coastguard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-4.1908
Under the code of conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-3.4685
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to keep their code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-7.3074
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , because they would not bring ' major changes or disabilities ' to their rescue operations .	-4.0312
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.3536
Minniti has meanwhile said that in recent weeks , the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen sharply , suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.8827
" In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.2972
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-2.9475
Anstiege and Trials	-1.8473
Neun Weilermer Biker , the " Berliner Außenposten " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy Trials and Sights for four days .	-4.0083
Three friendly guides were available for this .	-3.6118
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-3.1469
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.4550
The first tour led to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-2.9134
It was followed by lookout points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pfälzer Forest and the upstream plains .	-6.5886
In between , there have been prolonged increases for which long trials have been rewarded .	-5.2812
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-3.6324
Once again , lookout point , linked by " flowing " trials and moderate increases .	-5.2493
On the last two days , many elevations have been set .	-6.3733
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and caves brought welcome breaks .	-2.8792
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers breathe saltwater in the open-air inhalatory .	-4.9670
Neustadt was also fired .	-3.4306
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .	-5.1860
Console instead of grass - Bundesliga is preparing for E-Sport .	-3.9296
In the future , will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of struggling in the wind and weather over the stadium pitches ?	-8.7836
The fact is that E-Sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high margins included .	-4.8039
This is something that the first Bundesliga players have also recognised , which is increasingly committed to in this area .	-6.5253
In early 2015 , the VfL Wolfsburg , later FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart , founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .	-5.7808
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB " , says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.7625
He is sure " that there are still many clubs on this train " .	-4.9951
Next weekend the FIFA World Cup organizes the first Interactive Club World Cup in London , where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other .	-4.9960
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified .	-2.8019
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports .	-1.9616
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.7297
" Real football , in particular , has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-6.3559
And : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian ones .	-2.8070
With prominent e-sportsmen under the contract , they could be present on these markets much more often than just once a year to send the Bundesliga team to Asia .	-6.0972
What exactly is this about ?	-1.9488
In e-sports , computer games such as " League of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or FIFA football simulation are challenged at competitive level .	-4.6634
For a long time , as in normal sports , leagues have established in which professionals compete against each other .	-4.3897
And E-Sport is already part of the official program for the Asia Games 2022 .	-4.0559
But is it really a sport ?	-3.3572
For many , the idea is certainly useless .	-3.7108
Ingo Froböse has also long looked at the question .	-3.7967
For the professor at the German Sports High School in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions , which are also found in classical sport - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-6.1244
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and rapid responsiveness .	-3.5958
Professional gamers should train not only at the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .	-3.7423
" The fitte player is a good player . "	-1.7412
Froböse also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-3.8701
Controls are difficult to carry out when playing online , and the structures of classical sport were lacking in the scene .	-5.1491
On the positive side , the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-4.3650
The players are on the international stage , which is like a large global family , because there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.9263
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth for E-Sport .	-3.8998
In 2016 , it implemented EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship , and major tournaments .	-3.7666
Sales are expected to reach 130 million in three years .	-2.9351
That is little against the barely EUR 2.4 billion of the football league .	-4.3698
However , the E-Sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , writes the Deloitte consultants .	-5.6209
Many countries are already international .	-3.1954
Large markets are Asia and the US , where ex-baseball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseballstar Alex Rodriguez join the US team NRG eSports .	-3.9960
Hollywood-Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn .	-4.8891
There are also some things that are happening in Europe .	-3.7806
In a Norwegian school E-Sport was introduced as a teaching subject , Froböse says .	-5.8149
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , the first-league football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.1216
" In the European comparison Germany lags behind " , explains VfB-Vorstand Röttgermann .	-3.6783
It is only in nostalgia to fall , and to paralyse old times is no longer enough .	-5.7813
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company with the modern market .	-3.9715
" We live in a digitized world " , says Dutt .	-2.6976
'It is impossible to say that only football remains as it has always been ' .	-6.3928
Poison eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking	-2.9832
The poisoned eggs scandal is now affecting almost all the federal states .	-4.4418
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all eggs from the sale across Germany .	-4.1946
Only eggs are to be taken into the shelves , which demonstrably do not contain a fipronil .	-5.3711
Michelle Carter condemned for suicide because of the texts pushing Conrad Roy .	-3.9907
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .	-5.7457
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended in probation .	-3.9322
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing by Conrad Roy , who died on July 13 , 2014 .	-2.6448
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : ' My family is immeasurable .	-2.8459
My son was my best friend . '	-0.7890
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .	-3.1030
She was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered a mental illness .	-3.2884
In red trousers and a creamy blouse dressed , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and looking down when she was convicted .	-5.4555
" Your actions have killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.6426
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-2.3294
She has not assumed any responsibility ' , she said .	-3.1510
" She did not show repentance " .	-2.8775
But Carter 's lawyer said that it is a ' terrible circumstance that she utterly deplores ' .	-3.6644
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not find out that their " age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions " .	-3.4407
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy that there is ' no day on which I do not charge the loss of my beloved son .	-4.4199
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything , and I try to be there for his sisters , despite all the pains that we will bear for eternity with us .	-10.4708
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she was " persecuted " by the recognition that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children .	-4.2031
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep for the rest of my life with me , " she said .	-4.7637
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.4416
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.3855
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-3.0212
" Hang up , spring from a building , smell yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.6216
In the moments before his suicide , she wrote : ' You have to do it , Conrad ' and ' Everything you have to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . '	-10.2106
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press .	-3.4991
The case has divided legal opinion .	-1.9984
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murdering her British fellow resident in Italy before being released two years ago .	-5.0312
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , commented in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-2.8650
Joshua Kimmich : Learn from the new Mini Lahm of FC Bayern Bayern .	-3.4609
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to be captain of the Audi Cup is no accident .	-3.9030
The FC Bayern is mourning the Confed-Cup-winner for a big season - extra motivation does not hurt .	-6.4764
Something was different in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even though the extra garment was very , very small .	-3.8197
But , as far and wide as no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup , he made a stop to the arm of the .	-6.4227
" The trainer did not announce it " , told the Confed-Cup-winner afterwards , after his first use as a Bayern-Kapitän .	-5.0341
Good , the stand could have been better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-4.1994
But the sign of Coach could also interpret Kimmich .	-4.4124
It was not the eight-year old Arturo Vidal who was chosen as the leader of C-Elf , a young player , a debut player and a professional from the holiday .	-8.9521
Sugar is best distributed to those who would like to have a lot of confidence in it .	-7.8518
So anyone who has been expelled to take up the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well .	-6.0824
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-3.6095
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old fled the field as a mini-lamb .	-4.4870
Right behind , that is now his position , the white link at the arm did its rest .	-4.9630
And even Kimmich worked in this start-up formation like the one who can best take the rudder in his hand .	-7.0503
He gave instructions , tried to steer the unplayed force .	-2.6977
He had a glance at the whole thing , while many others were busy with himself .	-6.0415
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness ( scarcely folded ) ; Renato Sanches to get on with the achievements of the Asian trip ( also limited ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot did not negatively occur .	-9.0304
That , after all , worked very well .	-3.3454
Süle ran up next to Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acting sovereign .	-4.4739
The Napoli Storm was heavily occupied by the name , and Süle also tried to succeed in the construction of the game a few times .	-8.8425
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped ' .	-3.4978
But he also performed well in the debut .	-3.6238
Moving the game , changing the tempo : " For this style I was also fetched " .	-6.9077
How uninhabited this Bavarian world is for the new entrants , one saw after the match .	-5.4147
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two catacombs in the catacombs , but determined six or seven interviews .	-3.2114
After a couple of tough statements in the back of his new fellow players , Kimmich passed .	-6.4117
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is happening here , I have already noticed .	-4.3722
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game " .	-3.8362
After all , he no longer has to teach the new .	-3.4682
Alaba motivates ÖFB-Ladies	-1.8902
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies .	-1.9542
Austria ’ s most famous soccer player announced himself on Twitter just before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies well .	-6.9669
The Bayern-Legionär is almost Klubkollege von ÖFB-Kapitänin Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our Ladys .	-4.5222
The tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special splash of motivation .	-4.8647
Our ladies may well need the famous Bavarian dump .	-3.9948
Business satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissings Tempo	-3.8417
It was often unusually shaped , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.8179
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Economics Minister Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-4.0872
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy on T V 's question , and at the same time raise the old minister .	-7.1768
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Enterprises ( VTU ) , says : " Knowing responds to the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-4.4881
NATO ’ s biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy is that the loophole between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities .	-5.2509
This year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure , until 2021 the building law will be in place .	-6.5380
A role in the country ’ s plans is also played by the western circumvention of Trier , which is in the preeminent need of the Federal Railways Plan .	-6.5126
The goal is to start the route in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-4.4452
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.9632
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier , like Wissing , is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been going on for ten years .	-6.6338
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , praises the IHK .	-4.5617
The Trier Chamber of Craftsmen sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Meister-Bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-4.3409
A premium of EUR 1000 is foreseen for the best master-exam and EUR 2500 if graduates become self-employed within ten years of their master training .	-7.3552
But the country ’ s home-duty list remains long .	-4.0239
In the planned road construction , facts need to be created quickly , while the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glockauer , chief executive of the IHK Trier .	-6.3901
Of the 56 new engineers who want to adjust Wissing to mobility at national level , only 29 posts have been occupied .	-8.7938
The IHK asks for more orders to be given to external offices .	-4.1595
CDU Group Life Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than EUR 20 million in 2017 and 2018 less in the maintenance of national roads than proposed .	-5.2527
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it intends to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-4.7269
It is also sobering that broadband has been extended so far in the country .	-6.9588
In 2016 , regional companies only rated network supply in an IHK survey with the note 3.4 .	-5.1379
They complained about increased Internet connections and breakdowns .	-2.9891
On the other hand , former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is out of politics at the moment and is still on the supervisory board of the wind turbine company Pro Wind .	-5.5450
The Green Group left Lemke on April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe - where after four months of disagreement , she already cleared the field .	-5.4651
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-3.4941
One day before Audi announced that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles .	-5.9669
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-4.7827
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be modified to reduce their diesel emissions .	-3.1128
None of the companies described the company as a call back .	-3.6838
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-3.3753
But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-1.7825
The cost to car manufacturers to install systems for neutralising exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increases , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.8597
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with coddling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-2.8219
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which was able to regulate the use of what are known as switch-off devices , which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested but is driving back in normal driving conditions .	-7.9953
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , while others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.3135
Last month , Audi ’ s former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany .	-2.6871
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States .	-2.4478
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a question focused on the United States was extended .	-4.4090
The incorporation of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.6224
This message was sent to the Isar on Saturday .	-4.6848
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-2.1480
So that the visitors to the Isar will also be able to take a raft through Munich tomorrow Saturday , which has a special message .	-7.9722
On Saturday , the river Isar , which will see a large river between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke , will take place .	-8.2991
And that is not a usual flow , with Isar tourists .	-3.7277

On the river you can see a large Infotransparent .	-4.4910
It shows a garbage mountain .	-1.5645
The launch of a publicity campaign to appeal to visitors to the Isar .	-3.7330
With the motto " True Love is ... " the understanding of the Isar should be sharpened as a conservation wildlife flow .	-6.2657
Last summer , the flow of Isar and also this year , there were further actions and measures to achieve a cautious and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-7.6760
Mordillos Knollennasen and laughter for the suffering	-3.9542
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoons drawing , the node vases of his figures are his trademark .	-5.3294
Also with 85 the Argentine still draws and works on a film .	-3.9512
His message : laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-2.1078
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.8415
In his first years as an artist , he took on the role of drawing for greeting cards , which frustrated him .	-7.0073
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job was lost , " he said .	-2.4008
He was born in Lima , New York , and Paris in the late 60s .	-8.4538
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.3673
Again and again , the artist was inspired by cities .	-4.1809
Large , round Mordillo figures tumble into drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .	-4.7828
In the early morning , he says that he is still sitting at the table of signs , working almost ten hours a day .	-5.2422
Over calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , T-shirts , plushy and watches , his drollic figures continue to spread worldwide .	-6.1467
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a television series with his characters .	-5.4970
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos favorite animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent .	-3.8106
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come onto the cinema wall in 2019 .	-5.0874
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it 's strange for me " , says Mordillo .	-2.1601
The script is not written by him .	-1.5389
This is why he focuses more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without worries .	-6.1770
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change	-2.2027
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is under threat of climate change .	-6.7043
The lavender is declining because of the drought conditions and the diseases that cause insects , causing major headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.6336
Eric Chaisse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-5.1198
This affects the life of lavender .	-2.7345
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades , and there are a lot of them in very dry weather . ' , , the is . , the , the is .	-7.6609
And there is much at stake .	-2.0242
Lavender soles attract not only holidaymakers , but also perfume and cosmetics . , the are in , . , Lav, , , , , , , , , ,	-10.3261
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-6.1958
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.3296
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and a slowdown in evaporation from the soil , but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-5.0509
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön is celebrating its 1200-year existence this year .	-6.2797

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico	-1.6154
The weekly newspaper , Riodoce , usually meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime , corrupt officials , and ceaseless drug wars .	-5.4979
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.3960
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.0097
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children into office , who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-5.6003
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-3.2976
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and building feelings are enough .	-5.0827
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-3.9287
There is no respite from violence , and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are in the process : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 after attacks and threats under federal protection , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.9210
Among the latter is its editor and inspiration from Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.0003
" The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .	-3.2909
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-4.9549
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .	-2.6500
Although in 2010 a special office was set up to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated .	-6.0895
As with most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .	-3.8566
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating Sinaloa ’ s violence , even though it is immortal , and even though the terrain is more enigmatic .	-5.6859
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting for discussing security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-3.0980
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.7412
" As long as we do not know why , we mistrust everyone . "	-3.5151
On the morning of 15 May , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan .	-2.8654
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced out of his car and shot 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as the " Twelve River " .	-6.0350
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it near .	-2.8688
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.8206
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.6260
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan .	-2.3502
On the subject of Valdez , however , there is virtually nothing but silence . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.2738
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlegrounds , as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-7.0130
It does not matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the street every day , or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings , which are larger than many houses for the living .	-5.3560
Forget for one minute that there is a state of " calm " if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States .	-4.1348
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , has broken up with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .	-3.8141
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.5152
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival anti-trust groups in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.2898
This publication may have annoyed the sons , presumed Gangmitglieder bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-5.1974
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after confiscating another newspaper that had published the same story .	-3.3653
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.4630
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-5.5515
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold USD 50 holdings .	-4.9016
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the problem of drugs , " said Bojorquez .	-2.4678
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-3.8718
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard enquiries without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat .	-4.0557
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize for her reporting in Latin America .	-6.4494
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever it went .	-3.9871
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.7683
" I want to live on , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.5823
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV .	-1.6882
" You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb .	-5.1421
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.6727
The Riodoce team miss Valdez , the fun bird that could flood like a dock worker , the friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-4.1405
They trusted on their routine .	-2.2052
He would always bear his hat .	-1.8563
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .	-2.7615
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his derailment ?	-3.8207
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive .	-3.3888
" You don 't like it if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their homely runways , " to move drugs .	-6.5939
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.4377
The result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.5593
Trust your own instincts .	-1.0409
If it is wrong , stay away .	-3.1317
The trouble is , said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal , that " smell can be a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier . "	-4.8694
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states , where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is home .	-5.8906
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.5698
In the area where Riodoce ’ s staff met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . Days before , spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.8694
Draußen sought two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-3.3433
They were instructed by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan .	-3.5952
Half in the joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 % of the policemen who the governor himself called untrustworthy .	-4.7565
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-4.3852
For this week 's edition Riodoce has clicked on three main stories .	-3.9952
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.5490
They also had an exposé on government spending , which focused on the hometown of the governor .	-3.2679
And there was a group that , in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , removed a block from the prosecutor ’ s office , carried out a kidnapping .	-9.5172
There was no official word about who was abducted or what happened , so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.1634
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost the entire century all political levels .	-4.1050
Recently , several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption .	-2.8592
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.3378
Just a few months earlier , readers would have regarded Valdez ’ s column as the best informed source of abduction .	-4.3430
" In the past we would have known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of his slim body stature .	-3.3391
" Now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources . "	-2.8228
The Valdez office has been transformed into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because employees have become something they would never have expected themselves : activists on behalf of the press .	-4.8176
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-4.1826
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.8591
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.2719
Throughout the country , journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on wages and buildings .	-5.0455
On that day , director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-3.9817
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they said the truth .	-3.2604
She has since asked for the government to re-allocate it , because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-4.9161
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials involved and an equally valid society .	-4.4548
In his last book , " Narco-Journalism , " he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces involved in organized crime under a cover .	-4.8948
Last year , the media Guardian Group ' Articulo 19 ' allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and officials .	-4.0054
" In Mexico dies you because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-3.0749
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.2555
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-6.3942
Their body was found together with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel : ' I am here because of my reports ' .	-3.5385
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their separate head .	-3.6184
Some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.9114
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .	-2.6966
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled ' What do you want from us ? '	-3.5603
Some journalists have fled their home countries , or even the country .	-3.1850
It is a painful decision .	-0.7238
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.8517
And sometimes they are hunted , as seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015 , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City .	-4.2178
For those who remain behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-2.8640
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking frightens him .	-2.6784
" Mexico goes to hell , and so I became a reporter , " he said .	-2.6468
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was finished , the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to sum up .	-5.8747
A number of shootings with ribbons and security forces near Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .	-5.7377
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a series of antitrust companies in the region .	-3.1849
From the Bordsteinkante they have published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phones .	-3.9689
The front page had to be changed the next day .	-1.9228
Sirene stayed near - another shooting in the area .	-4.8855
Bojorquez threw a glance at the policemen who kept guards to see whether they were ready .	-6.1385
If they were even afraid , they did not .	-2.9906
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa , the staff of Riodoce followed his traces .	-4.5310
" How can you only think of closing " , said Bojorquez , " when on the same day that Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting . "	-5.2808
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade his enemies .	-2.6729
At first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.5153
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible nose horn of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as " Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs " .	-4.6210
It was so good that they were even able to see that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had had something of a " troubled past " .	-6.8650
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " called it " the best preserved preserved preserved dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaurs in the world " .	-4.2524
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier , which lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.5563
His unbelievably well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-4.1747
According to reports in National Geographic , the well-stocked vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-4.9592
It was found by Shawn Funk when he launched on March 21 , 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.9937
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rocks , and decided to look more closely .	-5.3178
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology .	-8.0318
They spent the next six years revealing the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth clump .	-3.9942
After all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.7552
" If you blink only a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it has slept " , said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is visible .	-5.1690
" It will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs . "	-3.9490
Researchers have found that this herbivore , though covered with armor and resembling a changing tank , was likely threatened by meat eating dinosaurs .	-4.6670
Dinosaur , which is heavily armored , used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-burial , which is also used by many modern animals .	-6.5628
This would have allowed itself to be better blended into its surroundings and to evade its enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-11.7040
The 110 million year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May for the first time and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.8777
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to discover it carefully .	-4.3400
Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists have made it possible to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-5.3720
They discovered the countershading , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-4.0313
Although the countershading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today 's animals .	-5.2728
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from meat dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.7418
But most contemporary animals that use counterfeiting - think of deer , zebra , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival .	-5.7088
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk age must have been , " said Brown .	-4.9031
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.0582
Scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence of his life , including his preserved intestine content , to find out what it eaten as his last meal .	-4.2384
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , came into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the sea bed .	-5.0722
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-3.3832
" This nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of animal , " said Brown .	-6.1206
" The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early chalk age .	-4.0844
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it . If you shoot only a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is at sleep . '	-6.1132
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs , which stood on two legs , ran through the earth .	-4.9584
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was driven by some of his fearsome ancestors .	-3.6442
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .	-3.0238
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Borealopelta was mumified after death in the sea and in the mud .	-4.4674
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he launched on March 21 , 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-3.5082
According to the museum it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the snout to the hip .	-3.4305
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.4152
It contained two 20-inch long tips that his shoulders were asking for .	-5.8092
Researchers believe that the armored plant frescoes were flooded by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-6.3893
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail .	-3.4844
The hidden remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover hollow panels along the dinosaur .	-12.6602
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is rare as a gain in lottery .	-3.4150
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.6484
Auxiliary remains of the skin still cover the wood panels that carry the skull of the animal .	-5.3418
His right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .	-4.0041
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-2.6861
In the thunderstorm : Mass karambolage on A8 : Many injured .	-4.2690
A serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carcass outbreak .	-6.9591
There are many injured , kilometres of congestion - and suitcases .	-3.8500
On the motorway Stuttgart-München ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon in a mass carcass outbreak .	-9.2840
According to the first data of the police , at 5 p.m. between the terminals of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) , during a thunderstorm , almost 30 vehicles , including probably lorries , were lost elsewhere .	-7.7600
The exact number of injured persons was initially not specified .	-5.1238
A police spokesman said it was a slight injury to the medium .	-6.8620
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site .	-5.5143
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .	-2.8993
In the direction of Munich , a backlog of around ten kilometres was formed .	-6.2214
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive obstacles on the counterroad - through numerous suitcases .	-7.0932
The fire brigade took note of the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who are now facing severe penalties .	-6.3702
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-3.1991
This resulted in a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-4.4184
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .	-2.9240
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.9999
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nothing punishes you sitting in the train and sleeping .	-5.3551
Or one is deepened into his work and has just a brilliant thought .	-3.7479
And then : pufff .	-1.3804
If the Schaffner arrives and wears an ungentle or rides the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-5.5903
Passport control .	-3.2065
But the time of interruptions is soon over .	-3.8081
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the complete ticket control .	-5.4521
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus devalue the ticket .	-4.8947
A test operation is currently running on two routes .	-3.5555
" If the offer comes , we extend .	-3.7954
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , " said a Bahn-Sprecher .	-5.0849
" Comfort Check-in " calls the train the ticket devaluation without Schaffner .	-5.0378
However , in order to be able to use them , a number of conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-5.1162
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do .	-4.4781
You also have to buy it via the train App , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of booking your ticket .	-5.5774
Last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-3.1048
For the " Comfort Check-in " works like this : You get up the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-5.3429
A button for electronic devaluation will appear on the test customers .	-4.9308
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that the passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-4.8567
When the train attendant comes to Place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online-ticket .	-6.8960
We can therefore continue to sleep , continue to work , remain silent .	-4.5585
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should be used for passengers .	-4.9406
" If you want to travel by train without ticket control , simply check in the DB Navigator .	-5.5424
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time by train " , says Michael Peterson , DB Fernverkehr Marketing Board .	-7.5249
Second Plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.2305
Those who often travel by train know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the greatest annoyances .	-6.3631
The fact is that it is often the case that one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents needed to devalue online-tickets .	-7.2468
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or a document you have to present .	-5.3084
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , which leads to a bad mood in the section or the area and delays in controlling your own ticket and ultimately takes time to deal with other concerns .	-7.9703
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.6949
And also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-3.0864
Further numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked .	-3.2651
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-2.7850
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-1.9943
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-4.2082
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School .	-2.3802
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " they said .	-3.9915
Confused because nobody else had posted the information on their feed , closed it Facebook and opened Twitter .	-4.2656
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline .	-3.5034
The rapper from the St. Louis area was killed by Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo . , live to .	-7.5808
He postulated an image of browns vivid body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours .	-5.4125
" This is wild " , Ferrell thought .	-3.1216
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.6313
She left her mobile phone to return to tweets on the Canfield-Drive in the evening .	-4.9224
There were photos of the police band and people shouting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father carrying a sign with the inscription : ' Ferguson 's police has just killed my unarmed son ! '	-4.3496
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellend dog .	-3.8810
In another video , she said , another policeman secured his gun and shouted : " I 'll kill you all ... animals . "	-4.1599
" This is not customary , " Ferrell recalled her statement .	-3.4828
'This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical ' .	-3.7337
At this moment I felt chilled .	-3.4830
I was angry and crying . '	-1.7856
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.9227
After landing at 23 p.m. , she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father ’ s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-8.4784
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from 11 .	-3.7287
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.3334
When Ferrell , with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , went to Ferguson , the two spoke a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state « .	-5.5971
" You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe in ? " she recalled what she said .	-7.6126
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.0432
I could not take it with me , " said Ferrell later .	-2.4730
" What has happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past . , , the , , , . , the , , , , , is , , , . ,	-8.6125
It needs to know it and see it and be raised in it .	-4.0375
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and black constitution , and what we must do to be free to free ourselves .	-3.7767
Although I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black women 's child .	-7.1497
I have the feeling that I would do her a disservice to keep her away from it . '	-4.4890
The first station , when it arrived in Ferguson , was on South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a campsite when activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.9987
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .	-3.4998
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.3906
Slowly , a new kind of activism began to take shape in Ferrell .	-2.1911
" My activism changed completely after 9 August , " she said and notes that she was a student at the University of Missouri St . Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on Essens-Justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.5715
" I had no experience in organizing .	-2.0532
Everything has come . '	-2.2314
Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.2478
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to document what happened .	-5.0639
One question came to Ferrell 's mind : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-4.3442
This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people , often white , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.2055
As Folayan recently stated in an interview , ' We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centralise their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-4.0881
Folayan had already cooperated with former co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death tract inmates .	-4.2866
His dedication brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals , followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years following Brown 's shooting .	-4.9345
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . " We talk , " said . , , , he , , , , and , , , and .	-6.4927
" That was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because that is how I will be presented . "	-5.3531
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement is not a messiah leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.0717
As a result , documents from Whose Streets show " surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-3.7470
" I felt naked " , said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-1.8640
" But I have understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people . "	-5.9906
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement .	-2.9546
Two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify as gay .	-3.4185
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and so we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-4.3060
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.2072
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.7152
She insists , however , that " this is not an affirmative type of action , " in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity .	-4.5272
" She was the person who shattered this energy , " she said .	-2.2702
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life at these crossings , as a black , gay woman is so much at stake .	-7.2086
You can feel your energy through the screen . '	-2.9737
In the meantime , the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue .	-4.1363
Ferrell is on currency for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.6299
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A Chaos " .	-3.7592
However , she clings to a song and she feels obliged to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-4.9116
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.0371
It is our duty to win .	-1.1033
We must love and support each other .	-1.2956
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-2.1651
From " dream " to " megalomania " : TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery .	-3.6514
The Bit Gallery moves people , although it is not yet built .	-3.5359
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-3.3920
Kalt hardly gives up the issue .	-4.6881
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.7130
While some say to the Bit Gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , the other side comes : " Do not a man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " megalomaniac ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.5679
While advocates are building that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , which will also benefit the other shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bloom .	-6.7583
In addition , the gallery is planned on the property where the farmer market hall is located , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-6.0454
This will stop at the start of construction work .	-6.8430
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside .	-4.5586
Simone Room : " We have been buying almost weekly in the farmer market hall for many years .	-4.7029
Our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women , are always very welcome .	-5.3979
We have also discovered the butcher ’ s shop for us .	-8.7883
We would like this offer to be maintained during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-4.0207
There are also other cities .	-3.4437
The small market hall in Frankfurt in particular is interesting . '	-5.0302
Gerd Densing : " Whether you are looking for direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , you will find the amount of the rent .	-6.1412
This should not be very low in the new project , though . '	-6.5100
Eva Kilic : " Wozu Einkaufspaläste in Bitburg ?	-2.5469
Whether clothing , shoes , drogeries or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-4.0101
That is enough in our city .	-3.1159
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-4.1622
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .	-4.8582
After all , the goods offered there are fresh ones , mostly offered directly by the producer and , above all , they are inexpensive .	-6.8044
As we can see , retail shops are only rented by larger companies in a shopping centre , because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer .	-7.1855
It is a pity that there are almost no more special deals and that what remains of them will probably disappear . '	-7.2313
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me .	-2.7997
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-2.2162
In particular , where is the farmer market hall to go during the construction period ?	-5.2685
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the Bit Gallery actually comes at some point .	-4.3383
Or does the ghost Bit gallery already manage to sell all shops from Bitburg ? '	-5.1273
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-2.2959
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-3.0662
I think it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .	-3.2013
But for a farm market hall , thanks to the insanity of many - I think - useless construction projects in Bitburg , there is no place anymore .	-6.7931
If the farmer 's market hall is destroyed , a bit of culture will disappear again . '	-5.6512
A suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA .	-2.6704
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost unnoticeable - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-4.5225
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-2.4460
Manning sent the sections from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst had a 35-year prison sentence , after making public diplomatic messages classified as secret about the WikiLeaks website .	-5.6276
The new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A Appropriate similarity ) .	-3.9191
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united its expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and Manning , a transwoman and pioneering dissident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-5.6068
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data , has created a sharp , though somewhat intellectual , comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.4232
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but who has been openly talking about identifying as a woman since her puberty , was sentenced in 2013 to 20 charges , including six breaches of the spy law , computer fraud , and theft .	-5.6048
Her image was suppressed by the prison , so much so that there was only one photo - a graceful , black and white selfie , in which Manning was visibly unwell sitting on a driver 's seat and wearing a platinum wig - with which she was associated .	-7.2804
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.6523
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers of forensic artefacts such as cigarette mute and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce an image of what these people might look like .	-4.8200
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.7183
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.1847
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you got in touch with Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-4.0218
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal friends of letters , which over the course of two years have exchanged several letters .	-9.1037
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's verdict would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-4.2938
Indeed , the fact that Obama would call for Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy coincidence .	-5.2092
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , because Donald Trump is waging a war against informers from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new , tweetful ways to further unleash the inflexible divisions that he should actually address .	-9.3139
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-3.1543
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for an end to " automatic fragmentation , based on gender , race , sexuality and culture " .	-4.8066
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-3.5585
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) as astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-4.2625
" What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-4.2917
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that is the 30 of these stories . "	-3.5090
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novels .	-4.4699
She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-on phone in the hands of the United States ’ disciplinary learning , such as King-Kong .	-6.7417
" When they make your speech cold , they have won , " it says .	-4.1752
" So never stop the mouth " .	-2.5233
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets from Philadelphia .	-2.6802
" I still get goose when I talk about it . "	-3.9472
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , by her own genomic simulacres that rally like hordes of protesters .	-6.1953
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Statur ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-4.1696
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.3607

Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford sought to kill for killing .	-6.0358
A country-wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and a university employee looking for suspects after a man was stoked in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with lethal injuries .	-5.5139
On Monday , orders for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as the acts of the Cook County Court show .	-4.3525
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-1.8801
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-3.5645
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.7820
Cornell Duranleau was declared dead on the site of the event , and detective investigated the stitches as murder , while the police actively searched for the two suspects , officials said .	-4.9154
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.0936
Alan K. Cubbage , the vice president of university relations , said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now in judgment and was excluded from the campus of Northwestern University .	-5.6113
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.0339
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.3525
A university spokesman and Somerville College said in an email that ' we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in every possible way ' .	-5.0830
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand .	-3.2382
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office , Anthony Guglielmi , said he strongly urge suspects to face up to the authorities .	-3.4994
" The police have an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , " said Guglielmi .	-3.0603
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-5.0150
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building owner of the Grand-Plaza building , who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008 .	-4.3811
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.1973
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July .	-2.6394
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.3894
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.5382
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-4.4883
" We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future " - the Russian Vice-Premier Mutko	-3.2864
Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented to restore the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.2841
" At a certain stage of compliance with the roadmap criteria , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.4206
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect " , explained Mutko on Thursday .	-3.0510
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and recently published on the organization 's website .	-4.1269
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia .	-3.2230
" Everything was announced , everything is implemented .	-2.1162
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.5646
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.2148
Regarding the matter Mutko said : " We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-4.2057
All measures have been implemented .	-1.4774
But there were no state programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-5.7244
Mutko ’ s words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission .	-2.8894
In talks with the Russian outlet RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.8689
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally , " added Smirnov .	-2.8408
RUSADA was ruled out by the WADA in November 2015 during the doping scandal of conducting drug controls in Russia .	-4.3853
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.4890
After a visit to Moscow 's headquarters in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving " in the right direction " in order to be reinstated . , , , , , , the , , , , , the , , , ,	-11.3997
For the time being , Aldi no longer sells eggs .	-2.5751
That was shared by the business groups .	-3.9465
It was a mere precaution that no health impairment could continue to be assumed , as stated in the communication .	-6.4982
From now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fipronile-containing anti-solvents .	-7.3455
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers .	-3.8401
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber .	-3.0188
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your staff at your e-commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .	-4.1689
Answers were often vague , unhelpful or , worse , fraudulent .	-2.5860
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.6273
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .	-2.3610
She called people from outside for help .	-2.2836
A new race of human resources startups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-4.3498
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , to address specific groups and demographic groups , to offer employees anonymity and complainant hotlines , and in some cases , to allow whistleblowers to bypass the C suite executives and directly address the management board .	-6.2666
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of your health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analysis tools are used by companies to measure employee commitment .	-3.7649
Errett said that she got a better insight into what your staff think and feel won with Glint in the three years .	-3.7488
In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a hit card of the company that at a glance shows which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can check why .	-4.7608
Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment that punishes those who have spoken .	-5.1378
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.6094
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could be worth more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let 's Talk Payments finance website .	-3.9634
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the midst of the Uber case discredited .	-4.0270
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.3937
Uber recently registered as a client .	-2.4664
Like Glint , Convercent allows companies to send customized " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas .	-4.5603
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior .	-3.3412
And when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-3.3622
" The court of public opinion has captured regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , founder and managing director of Convercent .	-8.1237
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotts , employee turnover and complaints , Quinlan said .	-4.9080
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant-chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .	-4.8037
In the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.3829
It was often intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of staff .	-3.2695
Now that Convercent employs , problems previously identified and addressed by executives in offices in cities or states can be concealed , such as discrimination , harassment , or unfair internships .	-5.8447
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree perspective in the experience with employment , " said Vitrano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.9976
" And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . "	-3.2973
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.8583
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .	-4.3473
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.7321
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .	-3.7847
It is a business model and an opportunity that Venture Capital will support investors who have supported both startups .	-4.9717
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-2.7343
Glitzern secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total financing to $ 60 million .	-3.2141
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture , and venture capital .	-2.2868
There is a growing set of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-5.0150
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only in use .	-4.0173
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.2849
" If people are glad to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.0642
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees are engaged and committed .	-5.1389
If the third-party analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.5118
The data on employee commitment to the experts in the workplace culture is important .	-4.5656
But the data is useless if managers of a company do not take action .	-3.1942
In fact , when a company asks for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.6369
And if change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees .	-4.3109
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data .	-4.6325
" Because if you do not follow staff will ask , " Have you really heard me ?	-4.0412
Do you care about it ?	-2.0601
And whom do you not care about why should I ? '	-3.3816
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , so Errett .	-4.1308
And , after receiving feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company by making decisions quickly and quality of communication , and add a communication training to address the problems .	-7.2528
At Ruby Tuesday , the company gets new insights about its employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-6.8847
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.9335
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.7662
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.3038
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the ruptures .	-3.7470
It goes up to 23 o 'clock when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team 's new practice fields on the campus .	-7.0526
Some have pulled out their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-5.3079
For a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break .	-3.7420
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center at 6 : 30 the next morning .	-5.0649
" This is a real treadmill for the guys for the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-4.0925
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .	-3.2137
Therefore , the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 19 : 15 to meet the players ' already packed schedules .	-5.3629
The compromise between the two days is more than a day on which the break in the beginning of the camp moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood practiced practical exercises .	-6.9573
They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August , 20 before formal game preparation for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-6.1348
Mora said that he supported changing the rules of the NCAA , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the player .	-5.6420
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.4835
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to plack , they are great people .	-4.5407
I think that once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-4.2210
The UCLA will put an end to its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which will not be easy , given the clear lines of its fields , given an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a high-class hotel that has already been advertised with footballs that have been clearing a safety net behind a gate post .	-9.1253
Bruins-Spieler is supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .	-4.3547
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.8997
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to record an exercise .	-6.8914
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is a pretty good business .	-2.9178
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces on car park 8 .	-3.1348
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.8879
I am therefore not too concerned .	-3.2212
We have a plan . '	-0.8067
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against fake news .	-3.3034
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reviews from third parties and then show their results under the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , one of its efforts to fake news .	-4.9980
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible wrinkles and send them to fact-checking fact-checking auditors who may show results of fact-checking from the original article .	-6.0929
Facebook was criticized as one of the main points of defense for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-3.7731
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hastily filled postings quickly as they did before the September elections .	-5.0973
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands , and Germany .	-3.6791
" In addition to finding out what stories are being challenged by fact-reviewed third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-4.8307
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the " related article " and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .	-3.6757
Creating a comic novel : A castle in the history of England	-2.1963
In his recent past , Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.9097
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-4.0235
" I think it is so nice to look at someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says .	-3.9345
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand " .	-2.5536
' A Castle in England ' covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney .	-4.3471
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional .	-3.0829
" I only reacted to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 's who worked for the Jakobiner , " he says .	-4.9208
" That is his down pressure !	-3.2026
And letters always smelt of smoke , because at that time , a fire was lit because of the light .	-5.8362
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there himself .	-3.8650
Oh , I love archives ! '	-2.3167
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( " To be honest , I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting " ) this seems all too beautiful to be true .	-5.1548
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , browsing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the monastic hymns on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .	-5.7503
He wandered through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape lovers , gardeners and sometimes also with artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-5.5379
Then , at night he drank " whiskey and began to write " .	-1.9753
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.7925
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees began to look after the archive he described as the " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , wirf it on the roof " .	-5.2238
Tagebücher , letters from the time of English empires , maps that represent who owned what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-5.2730
Young people , let everything go their own way ! '	-3.7254
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in English history on a broader basis , including The Labourer , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm rebellion of 1381 .	-5.3808
" There is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.3720
" The farm rebellion began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-6.1887
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-2.5176
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit pater , which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.7402
Or ' The Smuggler ' , in which the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted , staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.2150
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The gentlemen seemed to be pretty palate , keep making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-5.8191
Other generations of Darrell men redeemed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys , with a talent to promote empowerment . '	-4.8538
After the end of his work in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-4.5402
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki , the site of an early twentieth-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature .	-5.4910
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-2.5930
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.4530
It was like ' Ah , now I have to deal with the damned life again ' .	-4.6971
Campaign started : More than 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf is covered by a forest .	-7.0508
The town of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand in Rhöndorf .	-5.5652
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team will keep Nelson Artz 's logo and slogan secret .	-3.3054
At the end of August , there is to be a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth as the culmination of the campaign .	-4.3422
" Too good for us .	-2.5011
Or ? " , ask the actors of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-4.2694
" We don 't think this ( of course ! ) really " , they write on their website that was released yesterday .	-4.3830
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.7775
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems .	-2.2231
In fact , we firmly believe that we , as Bad Honnefer citizens , know very well the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.7471
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it continues .	-3.9544
" It is necessary to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistakable unique unique feature " .	-6.7372
After all , it is in competition with other municipalities .	-2.7359
The city of Bad Honnef can cost an average five digits of its new brand and campaign .	-5.2761
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdoğan ’ s Fear of the Army	-2.4598
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and promotions in the officer corps .	-4.4189
This week , too .	-2.3455
At first glance a normal procedure .	-1.9899
But nothing is routine for Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.7256
The sitting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as in the past , but in the Prime Minister 's office .	-4.8563
The five deputy prime ministers and the ministers for defence , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs have also participated in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government .	-5.9894
In this way , civilians in YAS were in the vast majority .	-6.5251
The government is pulling the gun in the military .	-3.1684
General Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the army commanders , the air force and the navy were deposed .	-4.8728
Since the failed coup , Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.5016
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army ranks – mostly because of alleged links to the exiled Fethullah Gülen movement , which Erdogan sees as the putsch ’ s draftsman .	-5.8341
There have been negotiations in Ankara this week against 486 people who should have been directly involved in the attempted coup .	-4.8927
As early as the day after the coup , Erdogan had described the attempt to overthrow as a " gift of God " , giving him the opportunity to " completely clean up " the armed forces .	-7.2512
But does Erdogan really control the army ?	-2.4221
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unbehagen in the Military Headquarters " .	-5.6178
At the General Staff , there are concerns about the increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which manifests itself , among other things , in the lifting of the ban on the headscarf for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-6.2527
Large purification of the army and the security forces is , in any case , continuing .	-5.0418
In mid-July , Erdogan , by decree , fired another 7395 civil servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.4035
Erdoğan seemed to have tamed the military .	-3.2758
The generals used to be the country ’ s actual masters .	-3.2409
Three times , they rallied to their role as guardians of the secular state .	-4.6837
After his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reform goals .	-4.3017
Former officers say that Erdogan is pursuing a targeted Islamization of the armed forces .	-3.7601
In the Vocal Europe magazine , a notorious officer who sought asylum after the attempted coup for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be ' full of extremists and salafists ' in a few years ' time .	-5.4249
If that is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-4.0917
In any case , there are doubts in the alliance about the Turkish army 's readiness to act after the clean-up .	-5.9477
Leadership structures and operational capabilities are ' weakened ' , say NATO diplomats .	-3.3807
Washington amends the Green Card Rules	-1.3722
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Trump said , cited by the media .	-5.6105
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas .	-4.0587
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.9842
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.8915
'This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries receive Green Cards . '	-3.9262
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.4070
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " Trump said quoted by the American media .	-4.4174
Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for racetrack huts .	-4.3764
Over the past few months , the future of the racetrack hut has been fought time and again - now it should be done very quickly .	-7.7257
Before the end of the year , it is planned to build on the maroden track on which the tourist railway operates .	-7.8249
In order to ensure the future of the racetrack hut in the long term , construction work on the track will start this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .	-5.5057
" With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country is committed to this link , which is particularly important for tourism , " declared transport secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.2679
The cost of repairing the route was around EUR 2.5 million .	-3.6356
Of this sum , the country takes 75 % .	-4.6846
The Treaty , on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country , is currently finalised , declared Sühl .	-5.7880
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .	-3.6418
" This is the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated " , said Sühl .	-3.9662
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .	-3.0790
This should be the regular order of the race steig-Shuttle on December 2017 .	-5.6591
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular train connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations , especially for tourists .	-5.1292
Over the past few months , a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by enough people to re-order it regularly in future .	-9.4670
The route is also heavily due to construction .	-5.9611
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it .	-1.7157
Just as you thought that 2017 could not be even more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the sex robots sector comes .	-5.8933
Yes , indeed .	-0.7939
Sex-robots are now a big thing .	-2.1347
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the in the next five to . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.1142
According to Noel Sharkey , emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University , and cofounder of the FRR , we need to start taking their rise seriously .	-3.2142
Customers can choose the eye-color of the robot , its shape of breast warts and the type of fingernails .	-4.0246
" People are making fun of them , but companies are delivering a great deal of it , and we will see them even more frequently , " said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-6.7081
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-4.6343
The user can also " customize " his robot according to his convictions , choosing everything from the robot 's eye color to the shape of the breasts to the type or color of his finger nails .	-5.9353
But it becomes even more worrying , as many robots have the " personalities " that would make a step-ford-woman look progressive .	-5.7742
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.4461
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows users to customize their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as timidity .	-5.2981
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-Robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which conveys the impression of shyness and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-4.2173
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as well as possible " , swarming the site of True Companion .	-3.8171
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you do not like , etc .	-2.8237
Over the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people !	-5.7119
She can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can be " in mood " !	-3.3499
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the submissive feminine features , the allusions to rape , when one step is taken on Frigid ( that is , striving ) Farrah worry the most .	-6.6983
On his website compared True Companion Roxxxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.4649
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men then have no Roxxxxy ? " says it on the site .	-4.0379
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-2.8597
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-4.4795
Most men will not , of course , hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes their rising popularity , they remain on the margins of consumer culture for the time being .	-4.4169
But what leaks out of the fringe zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-4.3821
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-2.1042
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women worldwide are under threat , when there is a president in the White House who has been irradiated to have sexually assaulted women .	-5.9731
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the winding bodies and the eye-blowing eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-6.1810
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-2.7049
The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as possible ( albeit with pornostar proportions ) .	-3.8892
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body .	-3.1367
But , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , the robots are not real women .	-6.5076
You cannot separate yourself from your pet or simply go away .	-3.6308
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission .	-4.1881
In other words , they are fake slaves .	-2.3650
Or to put it in 2017 ’ s Speech : Serbs	-4.9528
Trump ’ s Great Power ?	-1.7341
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense .	-2.0606
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have divided small families as well .	-2.9785
Around Christmas and Erntedankfest , there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump electing rel.	-4.2526
We are all allegedly trying to burst our filter bubbles .	-4.8182
Less noticed was Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.4682
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York . , , I , .	-7.4086
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-2.1574
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows them , including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and curiously on the same side .	-5.2743
This is certainly a good thing for the table , but it is also important to me that it carries significant risks .	-6.4846
The left was strengthened by Trump , but the distorting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .	-3.5810
When we talk about ' normalisation ' and Trump , we are referring to the gruesome possibility that one day his powers will no longer kill us .	-5.1872
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump normalizes right-wing Republicans , who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality when compared to his standards .	-4.8012
Today , I find myself trapped by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urcomic version of the crazy – the dog on the roof of the car , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) – both of which , compared to Trump , are actually very mild crimes .	-7.0630
When Trump goes , the Republicans ’ next candidate must be intellectually healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-4.1635
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to Central Park , the largest of New York ’ s Carousel Park Department , and the best three dollars that can be spent in the city if you don ’ t need a cafe . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.6719
The horses are huge , the Fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarcer and the animals twist to look at their own shoulders with fear - extremely finely and the climate-permitting music conveys this in a strange way .	-8.0670
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.1840
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is not , in fact , a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large circular traffic in the north of London .	-5.4148
The Central Park Carousel , however , is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two-year olds , one 11-year olds and two women in the 40-year old age can go on and all have a great time .	-7.4169
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-3.5815
On the other hand , this week I was forced in a department store to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-3.7966
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the valuation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .	-4.9647
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no one is needed .	-8.2698
The poor woman in the department store stood apologetic grinsend , while I tired of the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars .	-4.7842
Oscar Pistorius moved to hospital with breast pain from prison .	-3.7177
Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.0964
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts in his handwrights , according to the prison authorities , after a case in his cell .	-5.9465
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence .	-4.2227
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine ’ s Day in 2013 by shouting it several times through a door of toilet cabins in his house in Pretoria .	-5.7116
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was an intruder who hid in the cabin .	-3.7088
The prosecutors have announced their intention , this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too indulgent .	-4.1420
The national prosecutor said that she would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year .	-4.6524
Pistorius runs the risk of his punishment being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful .	-3.8105
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.8274
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg .	-2.6190
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the four-legged plaintiffs were fired from Fützen and Epfenhofen during the holidays and in the secondary schools .	-13.2596
Three of the dismissal students will go to school in the future , four to the real school .	-5.8285
On Tuesday evening , head of the school Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen .	-4.1503
As a symbol of school dismissal , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken house , but then is released into freedom .	-5.7231
In addition , the muntere Schar introduced a musical entitled " Der Adler im Hühnerhof " .	-4.9547
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it burst out of his chickens .	-3.4747
Instead of a chicken bowl , a small eagle came out .	-3.1015
But the hope of making a chicken out of him broke out , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and dec.	-5.4137
After that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance .	-4.9193
The hens danced with the young gockles , the cylinders wore to the bet .	-3.8415
The eagle stands for integration , said Schulleiterin Angelika Sitte .	-2.9319
The young animal is different from the other young animals ( chicks ) , but belongs to it .	-5.8879
He will never be like a chicken .	-1.6553
His rule is to be free .	-2.7295
She wanted every four-stroke artist to feel accepted in his new school .	-5.7918
It was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues , the former head of the school , Michael Müller , who always jumps into school passports , and the parents ' representatives .	-7.8566
The Kükenzeit is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-3.0389
After two years of teaching , they leave their students very reluctant , because it was a really great time .	-5.9789
Finally , they have been able to rely on the four-knife barrels .	-5.3764
At the end of the course , all the students had a song from summer time and holiday time .	-8.0190
Children were very pleased about this .	-4.7724
For the new school year , eight first-class students are already registered .	-5.3974
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.4468
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .	-3.7218
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal people were arrested in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.2444
They were released on the same day , while an investigation is under way .	-3.3436
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-2.2834
The Greek authorities have tightened up control over free campings and put substantial fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-5.3756
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.1287
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-2.8311
Software update for diesel vehicles : What those affected need to know now .	-4.1014
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-2.1133
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?	-3.1648
The most important questions and answers in the overview .	-2.3155
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.5375
They are supposed to improve the emission behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-5.0447
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt from this .	-2.7007
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :	-2.9763
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.3660
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.7223
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have debris software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-4.6387
Its retrofit has ordered the KBA .	-5.9053
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-1.8815
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet given a precise date .	-3.9759
Daimler has announced that it will write to all concerned .	-5.0825
If an inspection is already due , it will be done within its scope .	-4.2775
How long should the overall conversion period go ?	-4.6732
" Sword to say " , says Smetanin .	-2.9564
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure .	-3.2864
'For we have seen that car manufacturers have voluntarily failed to act on environmental issues ' .	-5.2722
How long should the update take ?	-1.9060
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.0981
It may be more time-consuming to get an appointment .	-2.6720
What are drivers not driving cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-6.7898
The ACE counsels for waiting .	-3.1675
Presumably , foreign producers would follow suit , Smetanin says .	-4.6002
Is there a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars ?	-2.9887
ACE fears that .	-2.1352
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten .	-3.6818
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.2795
The ACE advises to wait for a sale .	-3.1373
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award .	-2.3887
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glamorous events in Washington .	-1.8433
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to be political .	-2.5844
One of the prizewinners does not want to come out of protest .	-2.3913
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first Rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .	-2.9185
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .	-3.6500
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .	-2.6675
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Melania .	-3.4639
Lear , the winner of the progressive TV series , has already announced that he will not participate in the Gala .	-6.0614
He said to the New York Times : ' This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and this is a burden on me ' .	-6.0592
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view .	-3.7799
The Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.6281
The former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.1421
We make the city worth living .	-2.0088
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s Stadtbaumeister , retires next year .	-3.1490
The job is already advertised - suitable applicants are rare .	-4.2212
For 31 years Wacker has been a city builder .	-3.8947
And the work still gives him great fun as he mediates in the press interview .	-4.5853
He reports on varied but challenging tasks that await his successor .	-4.3930
At the same time , he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile .	-3.6769
The city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the earliest opportunity .	-4.4004
In this way , there is still enough time to be involved , taking into account the regular periods of notice .	-7.6098
Since Haslach acts as a subcontractor for the administrative community , the applicant must provide appropriate qualifications .	-4.6161
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case .	-3.9553
If they could no longer fill them up , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-4.4318
But closeness to the people is important to the city and to it itself , says Wacker , who reports about a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens .	-6.2522
In more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated , and Wacker looks back with pride .	-5.8507
" We make the city worth living " , he is sure about the building office and its staff .	-4.6320
In the future , however , various projects will also be on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatzes , for example , have begun .	-6.3575
The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , the stadium reconstruction is still a topic .	-4.3040
The latter alone will beat around EUR 1.5 million , " if we do it right " , Wacker estimates .	-6.0009
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.3879
Work here is fun . '	-2.2256
There is plenty of room for a city builder .	-5.3883
Haslach ’ s own building and gardening facility can respond to a lot of things quite flexibly .	-6.3613
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-6.4728
As the old town is listed as an ensemble , it is important to have " an eye for what fits " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing mayor emphasizes .	-5.9976
In any case , the Stadtbaumeister bears a high responsibility .	-4.5380
He is a builder , " at the end everything runs over my table " .	-4.6438
For ten years , Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been a member of Manfred Schöner ( Tiefbau ) for 15 years .	-10.4113
Also that his successor stays long , Wacker wants : " We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and stay with the job " .	-6.0919
Continuity is important not only for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city .	-4.0126
If you would like to inherit Roland Wacker , you should be able to present a completed degree as a diploma engineer or bachelor with a specialist in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of design and construction planning law .	-8.7019
The City Building Office is responsible for the construction , construction planning , basic employment issues , management of the urban properties , the Municipal Farm with Bauhof and Stadtgärtnerei as well as the suburbs of Baurechtsbehörde including monument protection .	-11.0654
Cycle thrown on lines : South railway line closed .	-5.5100
According to the police , the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway tracks in the area of Leobener Straße ( B116 ) onto the lines .	-5.0401
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-3.8372
The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-4.4927
Near the Tatort , witnesses were observed a rosaroter scooter and a bicycle rider .	-4.8836
" This goes far beyond a laughing bubble , " said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch on APA .	-4.6886
The perpetrator would have put himself at great risk and would also have put rail transport at risk .	-5.7921
In addition to the damage caused to the locomotive and the facility , as well as the delays and costs for rail replacement services , paedophiles of the railway customers could also be sent to the perpetrators .	-8.8523
Overall , the speaker said that it was a ' substantial ' sum .	-5.1790
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoons , and rail traffic on the southern railway line could be managed without obstacles .	-6.3123
Nearly ten passenger trains had lapsed Friday morning , two of them related to long-distance transport .	-5.9621
Freight trains did not lapse , but they were delayed .	-3.7149
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .	-5.1584
Isolators and masts have also been damaged .	-1.3915
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help ease IBD ( inflammatory disease ) .	-2.5971
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.6934
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory disease .	-8.9475
The incurable state of affairs affecting around 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK causes stomach and vesiculture , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-5.6807
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-4.8840
The senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not enter the body .	-4.1032
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .	-3.2064
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation , it may result in an inflammatory disease .	-4.0298
In experiments , it was found that a type of immune cell promoting tolerance occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their intestines .	-6.6119
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-3.1570
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the Darm microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.9040
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells " .	-2.7800
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan tolerates more tolerant , less inflammatory intestines , if the same system also affects humans .	-5.2829
Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immunology cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had been kept separate had not .	-5.8312
She assumed that the difference had to do with the intestinal robioms of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-5.4967
The mice ’ s dams were DNA sequenced , and six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells were found , but without them in the mice .	-5.7712
Mäuse was raised in a sterile environment , so they lacked an intestinal robiom and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells .	-5.7179
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - to unmature immune cells isolated by the mice .	-5.6745
The immune cells developed into tolerant cells .	-3.8573
When the active component was purified from fluid , it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3-Milchsäure .	-4.0760
If researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in mice ’ s feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but if the tryptophane levels were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.0401
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-2.7049
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-4.3712
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.3620
Potentially , high tryptophane levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . "	-4.4938
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a genius with Nemanja Matic .	-2.8451
At Manchester United , with Nemanja Matic , signed a " genius , " believes Jose Mourinho after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-5.1222
The £ 40 million signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game before the UEFA Super-Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the poster role , when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will .	-5.1809
Matic was excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the Blues and only managed 45 minutes , which allowed Mourinho to improve before the start of the Premier League season .	-5.7900
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football " , said Mourinho .	-2.0114
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-2.4329
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku stared in the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season .	-8.1859
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to meet three of its four priority commitments .	-4.4649
" Three out of four , for which I thank the association " , he added .	-3.6201
" I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken a great deal of trouble . , "	-5.9907
Boeing " malt " Dreamliner in the sky	-2.8058
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky .	-2.6278
The pilots flew from Seattle to the US State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in US State Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , which is several thousand kilometers .	-5.7279
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.5811
The shape of a Dreamliner was on the radar screens .	-3.3355
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .	-1.9863
Boeing had already made such advertisements in the past . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.1451
So the number " 787 " and the boarding logo was painted in the sky .	-2.9313
New setback for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem .	-2.5550
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was SPD boss , social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-4.6763
The main desire of the campaign campaigners was simply not a backwind from the federal government .	-7.6600
This has changed radically since Martin Schulz led the party .	-2.9886
Since then , the Willy-Brandt-Haus employees have been watching events in the SPD-governed state capitals with growing horror .	-4.9478
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds .	-4.3187
They were deep strikes .	-3.5765
One after the other .	-1.5217
The Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-4.8412
" This shows once again : Red Green simply cannot govern reliably " , said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-3.9310
Prime Minister Stephan Weil 's government has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil 's surprising group lease into a serious crisis .	-4.9534
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-4.3692
The Green Federal Managing Director , Michael Kellner , has asked the breakaway Dutch Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate .	-5.7853
Overcoming the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate ’ s will .	-3.8011
Elke Twesten must immediately give back her mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-5.2531
" All this must not be true , " a SPD campaigner sickens when the new Hiobsbotschaft reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-7.2566
Stephan Weil , the SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , is there without a majority of his own government after Elke Twesten ’ s rise to the CDU .	-6.2502
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD national associations .	-3.7509
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.8169
The plight began with the unexpected clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-3.5016
A blue eye , more not , was reassured by the comrades at the time .	-5.0143
After the regional elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.6689
It then became much worse - and that was all very much worse .	-6.6821
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the baptism , the Dusseldorf bankruptcy haunted the party .	-5.5499
In the weeks after that , the comrades quickly reappeared .	-6.6337
Then , when they had just exhausted new courage , the Hamburg G-20 summit came .	-4.5368
And with him came the next blow .	-2.5692
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-3.2640
And because , in crisis communication , he then made pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong .	-5.3126
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-1.7160
So now also Stephan Weil .	-3.0388
Because of the VW exhaust gas companies and their role in the supervisory board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been criticising for a long time .	-5.6825
Miese survey figures were added .	-2.2443
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , in recent weeks , Weil has been trying to place accents in the covenant .	-7.0936
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to extend his power in Berlin was not concealed by comrades around Martin Schulz .	-4.7668
They allowed him to be granted because they promised of Because stabilization of the party .	-4.8660
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.2813
Because the Lower Saxon Green Party 's internal dissension does not , in fact , blame it .	-6.8184
And Schulz certainly not .	-2.6841
For the time being , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.2804
Her anger is directed at the Greens , and particularly at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten .	-4.4684
" It is unbearable and anti-democratic , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of all the others " , says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD Bundestagsfraktion , the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-5.6951
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but because of the list of members of the Lower Saxony Green Party .	-6.4182
The logical consequence would be for them to give back their mandate .	-3.2185
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestagsfraktion , laments an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.6344
" The electorate 's will four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Weil the prime minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the lower Saxon SPD as a leading candidate for the federal election , the RND .	-5.7513
" Now the personal career memory of a future CDU member is distorting the election result , " said Oppermann .	-4.3386
He called for clarification of the background .	-2.6271
I want to know whether there has been more of this or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony .	-7.0689
Grants for Villagers III	-3.6676
Anyone who wants to renovate their house , which has been bought over the years , will soon be able to get support from the country .	-6.7365
On Wednesday , mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this .	-9.6765
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler gave another look at what has happened so far .	-4.3069
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen .	-3.9808
At that time , in the remediation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg still received two thirds of the funding .	-5.2652
In the 2005 to 2016 remediation area , the grant was still 60 % .	-4.1835
For Schindler , the remedies to date are a ' success project ' - it is , after all , important to promote internal development as well , and not only to open up new areas of construction .	-6.9164
On 4 April , the President of the State of Karlsruhe informed us that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-4.7863
The total amount of support amounted to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest from the municipality of Empfingen .	-5.4132
How will a rehabilitation area be created ?	-3.7388
They will continue to investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-5.4276
However , it also has a role to play , whether there is any interest in the planned area , to . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.2609
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be shifted again .	-4.3780
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-2.3923
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder-Program " Social City " , in which the restoration would then be carried out .	-4.5065
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of urban areas , the improvement of housing and work conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .	-5.0841
The measures would be object-related , that is to say per land , carried out .	-3.9330
The remediation area would then finally be defined as a statute .	-3.8920
The grant period for the funds has been up until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-4.7536
By September of this year , however , the inventory would be carried out once again , in which those involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire .	-6.3277
In November or December , the decision on the Statute should be adopted as far as possible so that the reorganisation can begin next year .	-6.7193
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary studies .	-4.9171
It is a question of evaluating and deciding on the extent to which urban problems will be remedied and to what extent .	-7.3220
There will be a notice in the basic book for the respective property .	-7.5992
Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen again and make an image of the situation , promised them .	-5.1275
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .	-3.6450
That is why there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .	-5.0925
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and property sheet " , which , among other things , deals with the structural state and the restructuring intentions .	-6.6167
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and housing sheet " , information on the size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made .	-5.2554
The blue " operating sheet " is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building .	-4.8250
However , Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .	-3.4501
Moreover , rebuilding measures are not eligible . , , , .	-6.5958
Schindler pointed out that the distribution of funding according to the " greyhound principle " works - who comes first , first , exhorts .	-6.0194
You can 't reserve any funding for later " .	-5.9245
Finally , photos of the project " Ortskern II " were shown in order to make the present a restoration " tasty " .	-5.8512
British inventor himself is using a microchip to get home and car with a hand movement .	-8.1774
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-3.9492
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between Daumen and Zeigefinger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq .	-3.8893
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .	-4.3909
The technology resembles a cats and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-2.8779
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .	-3.9976
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .	-4.3413
The advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars .	-5.0224
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to US $ 24,000 , according to the military data provided to the TIME magazine .	-4.4935
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.9343
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-3.1225
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine , a Wisconsin fire-fighter car and a Mississippi forklift truck .	-5.0156
The White House military office demanded the helicopter ’ s presence in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-4.4217
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superiors , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-3.8729
The news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m. and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.5231
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second crew would be required to return due to the restriction of the hours of service .	-5.8297
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event , while the unit ’ s security staff remained on the ground during the time .	-5.5888
It was not clear from the records made available by the TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately needed .	-4.8724
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.4267
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could violate the provision .	-3.8224
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-3.3678
" As if you were closed , " the deputy commander replied . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.7546
The " Made in America " event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.9691
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.9068
At the event , the President gave a boost to the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations .	-5.4600
The use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-3.2517
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip .	-2.7128
But to demand their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-4.4181
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential airliner carried out a survey against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , Taxidienste , and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor .	-5.9654
" The White House is thrilled by the show " Made In America " - the products from all 50 states manufactured by American workers using American materials " , said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-4.1501
HMX 1 crews often perform training flights around Washington and South Lawn in order to set the US president in the White House with precise centimetres .	-5.5839
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July , HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House .	-2.9172
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official .	-7.2829
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours a day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-3.5609
The White House said that taxpayers did not take the burden for any of the other props presented at the event .	-3.5137
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-3.1923
HMX-1 does not have budgeted names for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.5560
According to the Department of Defense ’ s hourly rate for the 2017 financial year , however , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $ 24.380 per hour of flight .	-4.2040
The aircraft ’ s flight time has been recorded as 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico , Virginia .	-5.6223
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate .	-3.0990
'Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refunds is highly misleading ' , said Walters .	-4.7291
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . "	-3.3498
According to a 2015 RAND study , the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract signing .	-3.8044
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-3.1020
" The idea is to present this week things made in America , " said Spicer .	-1.9473
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , of people depend on it .	-3.2118
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.3533
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.8933
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he entered the driver ’ s seat of a fire brigade .	-4.7270
In the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky ’ s representatives , and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-3.6592
" I know Sikorsky very well , " the President said , " I have three of them . "	-2.1241
TC BW Neuss with a tricky task .	-3.9066
The top runner of the second tennis league is in the table third viewfinder SV .	-7.7181
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss starts tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table third viewfinder SV .	-4.7225
Despite five games , the top runner of the second tennis league still has an impeccable record .	-7.8705
Teamchef Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-4.5003
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formations .	-3.6208
Especially on the back positions I find the team very good . "	-4.1662
For class and stability in the SV search centre , imports from the high north in particular are ensured .	-9.1438
" Their Danes and Finns can even point to wagers in the Davis Cup .	-3.8963
And they are also strong in double " , says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-2.5956
" As always , this will be difficult for us .	-3.3421
You also need a good portion of luck . '	-4.2944
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical .	-5.2511
His debut for Blue White could give Maxime Janvier .	-2.0722
The Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) , who is currently playing at the challenge tournament in the Italian Biella , does not create a Frenchman to the Bundesliga match , .	-13.2699
The hitherto unknown Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still in the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski .	-4.1935
He should be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp , Niels Lootsma ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Julien Cagnina .	-3.3418
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster , Máté Valkusz could again join the team .	-4.5834
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary , who was the number one junior world ranking in January 2016 , someone from the coaching school around Marius Zay will fill up the quay .	-6.4152
How America Can Loss OMV	-2.3353
Indeed , Donald Trump was not happy when he signed the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .	-4.3437
" In his hatred to enact the law , " he estimated , " Congress some " unc" .	-7.7505
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US push .	-6.4718
After all , the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.3974
Since then , investors from the local OMV , who , together with other European companies , have co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Railway Nord Stream 2 .	-6.1627
The Drohkulisse is huge .	-3.6555
Nevertheless , it is too early to assess the consequences , according to the official statement of the oil company .	-3.9076
In fact , Donald Trump himself would have to revive the sanctions by executive order .	-4.3069
Twelve weapons are his choice .	-2.0395

Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel in the hit series of Netflix will be spotted .	-4.7528
Despite the second season of Narcos , revealed by Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-5.3598
The stages three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest Bösewichte of the show .	-3.7883
With the third season , DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cali cartel .	-3.8116
Led by four powerful sponsors , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more state bribes and violent actions .	-3.3668
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.1675

Role backwards : The city employs 46 kitchen aids .	-3.7493
The city organizes the Kita lunch itself .	-3.6602
With strong contacts for the children and a assignment to the team .	-4.5609
The clock is rotated back in the municipal nurseries .	-4.4656
On 1 September , the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the city ’ s children ’ s day facilities ( Kitas ) again in its own government .	-6.6978
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Director of Youth Aid , this is good news : ' We have all been very pleased ' .	-4.3276
It is still cooked outside the house : a caterer takes on this task and supplies freshly cooked .	-6.9709
In the Krefeld area , the town operates 46 nursery facilities , in 44 children get a warm meal at midday .	-6.4651
In the last Kitajahr there were 2800 children each at the tables , and demand is growing steadily .	-6.2687
" Not only children who are served 45 hours a week are now eating in the Kita at lunch " , explains Pommeranz .	-5.8360
" The offer also applies in the 35-hour allowance , when children stay until 14 o 'clock . "	-8.7922
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the food delivered , they supplement salad , raw food and fruit , portionate the meal individually , give away the food , clean the kitchen , wash .	-12.2061
" The employees are fixed to a kita " , says Pommeranz .	-3.3152
The size - there are two groups as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the volume of hours .	-9.0278
" The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the kita team " , says Pommeranz satisfied .	-4.4594
" So they are much more integrated and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for kiting . "	-4.8885
It is also a question of healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-4.0304
" Children should help prepare food " .	-2.6562
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.4077
Also for children .	-2.0680
" They have a known force in the kita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people " .	-3.4506
This continuity is important for children .	-1.3810
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future . the .	-11.1779
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen service , also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical for the city in terms of cost comparisons between self-government and outsourcing .	-9.2817
And that , though 46 part-time workers are being reset .	-4.0400
" But these hours do not fall so much into the weight of some 750 people in the education sector , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-6.0238
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , according to the UN .	-2.1371
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .	-2.2856
Nicholas Haysom , President-in-Office of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will stand in the provinces in the Council elections , with three women standing for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters being women .	-4.7156
" The role of women cannot be overestimated " , he said on Wednesday in a statement .	-1.9077
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.7182
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.6544

Men try to rob 13-year-old girls .	-2.6150
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to deprive a 13-year-old girl .	-3.4994
According to police information , the men spoke to the 13-year-old , who was on the Kolping Road with friends , at 2.55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl 's cell phone .	-7.1563
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends .	-4.9118
One of the perpetrators then tried to attack the girl 's cell phone and necklace , but that was not the case .	-6.7812
Without loot , the duo fled .	-2.0574

GMB concerns about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.4801
A trade union would like to ensure that McVitie , a biscuit manufacturer , is in control of the long-term commitment to production at her plant in Glasgow .	-7.3786
GMB Scotland said that the company weighed over the future of investments at the Tollcross site .	-3.9971
More than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse alongside .	-4.8401
McVitie ’ s owner , Pladis , said that he has invested more than £ 5 million in recent years .	-2.9208
He added that employees and trade union representatives would ' be the first to learn ' if their activities were to change .	-4.0654
In a letter to the company 's head office , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called for ' to express concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines would not be promoted ' .	-5.7533
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross by the General Staff Manager is deeply affecting our members .	-5.1087
Generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation .	-4.9320
That is why , from the perspective of jobs , wages , and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , rising living costs , and chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie .	-5.0601
A spokeswoman from Pladis said : " Only yesterday , the head of the branch at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-6.0043
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-3.3587
We discussed with the staff that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate , are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-5.8594
She added that in recent years we have invested more than GBP 5 million in our Tollcross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.8804
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production facility , and if our operations change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know it . '	-5.5321
Did the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago against Neymar ?	-2.1297
The site of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti .	-2.5589
Paris Saint-Germain will not decline in its pursuit of Neymar , having made an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record attack ?	-6.1279
The sensational approach fueled the summer transfer window , because the league 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous mark , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for £ 89 million .	-4.2615

When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-6.2953

But if they try to sign up to one of our players , they will have consequences . '	-4.1543
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer .	-3.8233
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar .	-4.4592

Interview : " Domspatzen-Bericht entlastet Papst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger "	-1.9780
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves Papst-Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-3.7135
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.6878
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussion .	-3.8422
Christian Weisnder , Speaker of the Reform Movement " We are Church " , declared after publication to the German Press Agency , he expects from the former Regensburger Bischof and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI. , an apology .	-4.7956
It would greatly serve the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their misapprehension at the time of the events .	-5.1942
The Vatican Congress , on the other hand , criticized Osservatore Romano for using ' double standards ' to report violence in the domains .	-6.7081
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that they are ' shameful and shameful acts ' that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the ' degree of media manipulation ' , according to the authors Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee .	-6.2649
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-4.1912
Also Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian radio : " You are happy to go to the church and this is a frozen fresco " .	-6.4942
She also pointed out that , in her youth , ' beating was a normal pedagogical means ' to deal with young children , as I was one . '	-6.6498
It would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.4642
In the context of the reports on abuse cases , Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-5.6123
Unjustifiably , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the memorial band " My Brother of the Pope " with Ratzinger ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-4.5229
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger " , says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he evaluates the results of the final report .	-3.4633
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment Attorney Ulrich Weber ?	-2.7794
Altogether 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 domspatzes .	-4.5536
In the final report , Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , states : " To sum up , therefore , it can be said that , in many cases , domain master R. used forms of physical and psychological violence .	-6.0535
Particularly with a high level of emotionality , punishment for the pupils could also be more severe .	-6.1652
Despite this , contrary to many other accusations , many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases , despite violence , even have positive memories with him " .	-7.5540
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves his opinion .	-4.3610
Mr. Hesemann , the 440 page report on the " incidents of violence against defensive foals in the Regensburger Domspatzen " gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-5.2793
On the one hand , many students highlight their " humanity " .	-3.1829
On the other hand , he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist , who became more palpable when a domain record did not produce a top performance musically .	-7.5547
How do you view this final report as his biographer ?	-2.7876
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually comes in .	-6.3040
He is just eight pages devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.9239
The violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of action .	-4.2384
At best , he can be accused of not being sufficiently serious about it too late or of not having taken first hints seriously enough .	-6.9312
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by practically all respondents as - literally - " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-4.7664
Thus , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also exhibits an excellent testimony , describing him as " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " sympathetic " , as extremely good-natured teachers , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and bons and " always surrounded by grapes of children " .	-7.2876
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which led to outbreaks of rage .	-5.0676
He deeply regrets and apologizes not only that he threw the key bund on the ground , but also that he spread arrogance and pulled too cheerful boys on the hair or ears .	-10.0243
But , in his honor rescue , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question , the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , both among parents and teachers .	-5.6645
Do you know these methods ?	-4.0477
Of course , I think each of us born before 1968 .	-2.4337
I , too , have experienced this in a secular school , a state school .	-4.3951
Compared with what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violent police on the preschool , these are , of course , bagatelles .	-7.0887
One wonders if it is not about his fame and role as Benedict XVI ’ s brother , to do so , that many media have just plunged into him . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and , the ,	-9.8966
Many people who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope .	-4.3659
The truth , however , is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-5.7976
Much has been reported in the media in connection with the report on abuses in the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-4.8802
Will Georg Ratzinger , in the final report , also be charged with any involvement or cohabitation in sexual abuse ?	-5.3406
Michael Hesemann : absolutely no .	-1.9659
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted himself to the master of the domain .	-4.2482
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-2.2613
" I never dared to talk to my father or mother about this , " said a concerned deputy for the others , " It was all very embarrassing to me " .	-5.2716
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was , and is , that most victims remain silent .	-4.6821
If they did not even entrust themselves with parents and siblings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been , in some way , a colleague of the perpetrators .	-6.0226
How do the Domspatzen students rate rates for abuse cases ?	-5.2401
Michael Hesemann : A questioned student put it this way : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I see no case in which Georg Ratzinger could have had timely insights and stopped the perpetrator .	-6.0018
I also think it is really absurd to assume that he or she has been given a more urgent or clear mandate than to her parents , supervisors , trustteachers , etc .	-10.2557
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.9116
As a result , the report concludes quite clearly : ' The fact that pupils and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation ' .	-7.1969
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free of any complicity .	-4.7661
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented him or brought to the notice .	-4.7758
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these illegal crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-4.1000
In the media there was much to read about " Gewaltexzessen " at the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-4.4050
Georg Ratzinger , the former master of the cathedral , is accused in the Wegschauen report .	-4.6429
Do he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.5419
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed up and mixed up in the coverage , becoming a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle , Georg Ratzinger .	-6.3329
That , however , is precisely the abuse of the report .	-4.3235
There is a clear separation between the preschool and the gymnasium of the domains , between sexual abuse and violent practices and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.3570
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir conductor of the Cathedral Traces .	-6.1107
The horrific caning pedagogy , the cases in which boys from sadistic teachers were harassed and maligned , and suffered horribly , all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions had to be avoided .	-8.1599
But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium .	-5.3751
On this was , as most witnesses emphasize , the topic " preschool " taboo .	-3.6748
One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even " paradisiacal " states .	-8.3394
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-3.3095
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but not sadistic violence .	-3.8440
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that " many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases , despite violence , even combine positive memories with him . "	-7.5644
At most , the accusation of having looked the other way remains .	-5.7714
However , despite all the efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the conditions at the preschool .	-5.2434
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and was not aware of what happened at a school where he was not working and responsible ( as the witness said ) , and only then again around 1993 .	-7.7727
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently listen to the conditions ?	-4.2200
Michael Hesemann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.3713
In it he points out to them that ' the caning penalty is still practised in the pre-school ' .	-8.2370
In view of the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.5860
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was in place when caning penalties were already banned in Bavaria .	-4.7893
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as we all know .	-4.4656
It was also difficult for him to assess where the people concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised , and where the permitted limit had actually been exceeded .	-6.0277
However , we cannot say that it has always been looked away .	-4.6364
That is simply not true .	-1.4020
It was only in 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-3.4721
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to the times .	-3.9537
How do you see this ?	-1.8508
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " pitfalls of anachronism " , in other words the danger of judging past by today 's moral standards .	-4.2950
The princes are right there .	-3.3721
But that does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was odious , nor to what was concealed in the pre-school of dissent and violence against innocent children ’ s souls , which goes far beyond what was then the practice .	-7.2155
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .	-4.4544
At the same time , however , I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.4141
His means of disciplining and punishment , in other words earfeiting and pulling hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-5.7989
When physical punishment was then banned , he kept strictly to it .	-4.6330
What image of his time in Regensburg has Georg Ratzinger given in the talks with you for the book " My Brother of the Pope " ?	-5.1840
Is the subject of caning also mentioned ?	-4.2319
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , because the domain treasures played only a side role .	-5.5195
Nevertheless , I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.8989
But that must also be said : without this perfectionism , without the insistence of absolute discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class fame , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-6.6500
With biscuits and bonbons alone , you don ’ t have to be a big singer or a great success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-9.7472
As a person , did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the discussions on her book ?	-4.5684
Michael Hesemann : By working on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have always seen him as a wonderful , humorous , ground-friendly , deeply believing and heartfelt man , from whom it is impossible to imagine that he could only do something for a fly .	-8.3935
I regularly get to know how many former domains still today , 23 years after his retirement , keep in regular contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-5.3939
So those who have not yet forgiven him for being strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-4.3784
Most of the domain treasures are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them .	-4.7727
And that he was always a good , father-in-law teacher - a strict father , certainly , it may be - but it was also a respectful man to whom they still look up today and whom they almost worship .	-9.1698
And I would ask you to make it quite clear once again that all you accuse him of is educational methods that were on the agenda at the time .	-7.4534
We can be glad that we have long overtaken this period .	-3.9269
But it is highly unjust to make a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother , a media scapegoat . .	-7.0664
There is all too obvious the evil intent behind it .	-4.1367
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.0891
Now the decency would finally make peace for a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit and who , without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps still no one in Germany , would know the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-8.9300
