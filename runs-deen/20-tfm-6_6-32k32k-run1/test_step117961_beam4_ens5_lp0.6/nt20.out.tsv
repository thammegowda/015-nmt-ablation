The chemical factory had already made headlines in the past , for example , when a leak leaked the gas from methanthiol in 2013 and the surrounding area went far into bad eggs . In 2015 , after an industrial accident , around 2,000 litres of mineral oil went into the city ’ s wastewater system .	-9.9838

Oil tanker Stena Impero left Iranian Port	-7.5133
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities , the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " left the port of Bandar Abbas this Friday .	-3.6748
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian Government on Monday , but initially it remained in Iranian waters .	-4.0808
The " Stena Impero " was charged on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz with violating security rules , but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker before the British-owned Gibraltar .	-6.7464
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the world ’ s most important shipping routes , connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean , and shipping much of the world ’ s oil exports through the straits . Tensions in the region have intensified enormously over the past few months , and merchant shipping has been dragged into the US-Iran conflict , with several incidents involving tankers and drones .	-7.7283

Musk Waits for Delivery Record	-2.7385
Tesla ’ s quarter may be holding a record ; despite the delivery boom , losses in the electric car group have been reported .	-7.4713
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries , " Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek " .	-5.8116
Tesla has a strong demand for 110000 orders , according to Musk ’ s newsletter .	-8.9804
In the second quarter , Tesla delivered more than 950,000 cars , reaching its previous peak .	-6.6277
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals , and in 2019 he plans to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars , with six-figure figures in the current and next quarter , especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 , but here the profit margins are low .	-8.8537
Solving puzzles : That ’ s why we cannot tickle ourselves .	-5.1240
A kind of brake in the brain prevents people from ticking themselves , as scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with experiments on rats , as they reported on Thursday evening , with progress being made on why children are so fiercely opposed to tickling , only to demand more .	-9.0371
After all , it has also been shown why only the sewing of a tickling hand causes laughter before touching , lying on a deep layer in the hive , which causes laughter when waiting for the tickling .	-10.2773
According to the data , earlier research showed that rats react with " laughter " in the ultrasound area when they are kicked by humans .	-5.8057
Laughter is suppressed while Self-Contact	-4.6250
The researchers of Berlin have now found in the experiments on the rats that the laughter and the activity of the area of the brain ring are suppressed during a self-touch , even if living creatures are plastering themselves .	-10.9964
However , if self-touch and contact through others at the same time is also suppressed , this indicates that the rat 's brain cannot distinguish between self-touch and contact by others .	-8.2334
In addition , the rats had been trained to tickle themselves , and so in the experiment they sometimes broke off this initiation , showing escape behaviour or scaremongering .	-11.3126

The chemical factory made headlines in the past – for example , when a leak leaked gas from methanthiol in 2013 , and the surrounding area rushing far into lazy eggs . In 2015 , some 2,000 litres of mineral oil went into the city ’ s wastewater system after an industrial accident .	-8.2945
Brexit : Johnson ’ s Own Sister	-3.8757
The prime minister ’ s sister commented on Boris Johnson ’ s speech in Parliament ’ s first session after the forced break on Wednesday evening , when the prime minister threatens to lead the country from the EU without an agreement on October 31 if Brussels does not agree to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement , but how he will achieve that is unclear .	-7.7577
Through Cox , who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union , the Prime Minister said : ' The best way to honour Jo Cox 's memory and unite that country would be to leave the EU ' . Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016 .	-5.6465
Remembering the Oslo and Utoya attacks	-4.9269
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya , with 77 dead , a memorial in honour of the victims will be unveiled on Saturday in Norway .	-5.7190
The project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled in the same place - the roses were forged by people from all over the world , including survivors and victims .	-6.0046
On 22 July 2011 , the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first fired a car bomb in the government district of Oslo , and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the Social Democratic Workers Party ’ s Youth Organization on the island of Utoya , killing 77 people in the attacks .	-6.9414
Iran Frees British Tankers	-1.5041
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict , but now there is less of a problem , and the Iranian-held British oil tanker " Stena Impero " could once again be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Rouhani 's peace plan . the were . were , , and . were . , , and .	-11.3433
Stena Impero , a British oil tanker held in the Strait of Hormus in Iran in mid-July , is back in international waters .	-4.7495
The crew of the " Stena Impero " left Bandar Abbas 's port and now , among other things , are going to Dubai for medical investigations , said Reedereisef Erik Hånell .	-9.3180
" This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas , and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law , " said a Friday communication .	-5.2629
According to Hånell , seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September , and the remaining 16 crew members were doing well in accordance with the circumstances .	-10.1622
The British Government suspected a similar incident in Gibraltar following the establishment of the Stena Impero : at the beginning of July a supertanker with oil from Iran , which was supposed to have been destined for Syria , had been set in the chain , and the delivery , according to the authorities , failed to comply with EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria .	-8.6921
In the mid-August , the " Adrian Darya-1 " was finally released , and London vehemently rejected allegations that it was a bargain to free the " Stena Impero " .	-7.9039
The Strait of Hormus is one of the world ’ s most important shipping routes , connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean , and shipping much of the world ’ s oil exports through the straits . Tensions in the region have intensified enormously in recent months , and merchant shipping has been dragged into the US-Iran conflict , with several incidents involving tankers and drones .	-7.8671
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries , with the Americans accusing Iran ’ s leaders of wanting to build nuclear weapons , which Iran rejects . The US had unilaterally withdrawn from the international nuclear agreement in 2018 , which was supposed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb while ending its political and economic isolation . Since then , the US government has been pressuring Iran ’ s leaders into imposing massive economic sanctions to impose a tougher and more extended agreement on other areas .	-8.7535
Due to the dispute over the Stena Impero and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia , the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region .	-4.4405
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York .	-3.6678
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policies .	-2.8192
In view of the punitive tariffs imposed on Chinese manufacturers by America 's President Donald Trump , foreign producers in the People 's Republic are forced to reassess , with Asian leaders considering moving their production from China to another country , India appears to be one of the preferred alternatives in a survey by UBS , but this has nothing to do with the vagaries of the Sino-American trade war , with a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers creating India as a way to play a more important role in the globally wide production chain .	-9.8397
But now India has become Trump ’ s focus , with the White House hoarding as the “ Kingdom of Tariffs , ” America removed the emerging-market country ’ s trade preferences for 2000 products in early June , with the US accusing India of prohibitively high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods , mobile phones , spirits , motorcycles , and more .	-7.1516
On the world map of trade wars , however , friction with India is nothing but a sideshow , and America also views the world ’ s largest democracy through its security glasses . Delhi and Washington share concerns about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean . Against this background , a salvage of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely , and India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who has just assumed a second term in office for five years , is likely to prevail .	-9.4246
But the problem lies elsewhere : the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development is a difficult one in the Socialist Republic of India , and in Modi , too , its reform zeal is aimed mainly at the bureaucratic madness that has stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long ; firms are now receiving faster construction permits for buildings ; they benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure ; and a more griffy insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for liquidating seemingly dead companies with high levels of debt .	-10.7308
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings , but much of has changed for the better in India over five modes .	-14.3613
In the West , Modi hangs on the nimbus of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country economically . This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what Western managers ’ vocabulary is . At its core , however , the India First Advokat never depended on protectionist economic policies , preventing Indian firms from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus fit for global competition , while businessmen who survive thanks to the closure of their industries are among the tribal constituencies of Modi ’ s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and lament this short-sighted policy .	-9.4671
Insertion of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday	-2.7384
According to a report , former French President Jacques Chirac is to be buried in Paris next week , and the former Head of State will be buried at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital on Monday , according to the AFP news agency , referring to the Chirac family , with the funeral being in the close family .	-7.9789
Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships .	-4.9505
In the first run of the men over 5000 meters , Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to waver dangerously , barely standing on his legs 300 meters before the goal , ran into an unhealthy attitude when Braima Suncar Dabo , from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau , suddenly stopped him and propelled him to the last half stage round .	-10.5885
" I just wanted to help him , and everyone in this situation would have done the same , " said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone , when he drew the attention of the assembled journalists , shying away first , didn 't want to talk about his heroism at all , after all he wanted to set up his personal best time , and when he realized that this would be difficult , he just wanted to help a loved one , and anyway he would only be proud to represent his country , which was invited by the World Cup , and in normal circumstances he should not even have started . , " , , I , , , and .	-14.7680
In the end , Dabo was disqualified by the World Athletics Association , just five minutes after the Ethiopians Selemion Barega , who won the race .	-9.8559
Dabo , who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon , had come to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha .	-8.4702
Millions of Migrants : Egyptians are preparing for Wild Protest Day .	-4.7468
In Egypt , security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible anti-government protests .	-5.7219
In the last few days , the police had stepped up their road controls , and pedestrians ' mobile phones were partially searched for news and photos related to the protests , hundreds of which were arrested according to two non-governmental organisations .	-7.0969
Opponents of Al-Sisi	-1.4330
Last weekend in Cairo , Alexandria , Suez and Mansura , hundreds of people protested against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi , who accused critics of corruption and mismanagement .	-5.2807
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms ( ECRF ) reported more than 1,570 arrests until Friday .	-11.5241
Arbitrary arrests	-0.4951
HRW has been accused of being " arbitrarily arrested " , " just because they were " in the wrong place at the wrong time " , and has been accused of detention on the basis of lawyers .	-10.9463
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country , so the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi .	-3.6977
Online Dealers : Mailing Dealers Should Donate Returns Easily	-6.4977
For online retailers , many returned packages are lost goods , leaving around 20 million returns to waste , but there is an alternative .	-6.7050
The Treasury has shown online traders like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products rather than destroy them .	-4.0202
Although companies could not be exempt from the VAT on material donations , the ministry raised a question from the Green Party group , which was reported by the radio media group newspapers on Friday , but traders could set the market value of unsold returns so low that they would have to pay no or little VAT .	-9.5203
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens would return every sixth package of Internet orders , with around four per cent of the goods - around 20 million products - then dumped , and donating it would cost companies additional money under current law , because the financial authorities rate contributions like a turnover on which sales tax would then accrue .	-11.1954
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called for Finance Minister Olaf Scholz ( SPD ) to make it clear by a decree that companies can evaluate non-saleable products and donate them to non-profit organisations free of charge .	-7.2879
Banksy Art for Auction : There was never a better time to sell this painting .	-2.6461

For Branczik , Banksy ’ s work emphasizes the “ reconstitution of the world ’ s oldest parliamentary democracy into the animal and tribal attitudes ” .	-7.6742

Most recently , Prime Minister Boris Johnson , at his first meeting in the House of Commons on Wednesday following the repeal of Johnson ’ s forced recess by the Supreme Court , came up with a crackdown with the opposition , and Johnson wants to see Brexit , already postponed twice on October 31 , without any agreement with the EU .	-9.6121
It is not the first time that Banksy , whose identity is still unknown , has interfered in the Brexit debate . In Dover , in the south-east of England , he painted a picture representing a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a knife , seeing thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom every day .	-6.0606
The Brexit Debate is like a Park Walk	-3.4505
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’ s violent verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred , according to his top adviser . Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum , the current controversy is a " walk in the park , " said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation . " We enjoy it , we will leave ( from the EU ) and we will win . "	-7.0545
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament hard in recent days , accusing them of , among other things , " treason , " on the people , making accusations that it could put MEPs at risk because they could , for example , become targets for death threats , a " humbug . "	-9.4287
Cummings said that the only way to restore calm was if MEPs finally respected Britain ’ s decision to leave the EU . It is not surprising that people were upset that the UK had still not left the EU three years after the referendum .	-5.7200
On Friday , even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint in the face of the convoluted mood . ' We should talk with respect ' , a statement said . , , and , . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.5735
Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Khan Calls for Uno Intervention in Kashmir	-1.6250
In an emotional appeal , Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly .	-3.9890
Otherwise , a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely , Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday . " If that is going badly , one hopes for the best , but be prepared for the worst , " The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir .	-7.1925
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947 , two of them around the divided region of Kashmir , and both nuclear powers control part of Kashmir , another part of which belongs to China . In early August , India had stripped the region of Indian Kashmir of its autonomous status , dramatically increasing tensions with Pakistan .	-7.1836
Not even a bottle of water	-0.9170
The protesters in Cairo are demanding the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi .	-2.4294
The government ’ s response to the current protests in Egypt is a tough one , with heavy ammunition firing on the population , more than 2000 detainees joining the 60,000 political prisoners already in prison , and protests in Egypt have never been safe . But , since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013 , the state apparatus has been doing everything it can to avoid a scenario like the one in the Arab Spring .	-8.5355
But one of the causes of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation : poverty , lack of prospects , and the sense of being stifled by one ’ s own government drove millions to the streets , and that is a problem that El-Sisi ’ s regime , no matter how tough it is against adversaries , has even deteriorated .	-6.8803
Today , one in three people in Egypt lives below the poverty line ; since 2016 , the currency has lost more than half its value , the inflation rate is at 10 % ; if you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket , you have to decide whom to finance : Nestlé , Coca-Cola , or the military , which is not only responsible for repression , but is also the biggest economic actor .

Tv-checks at the terminal : BER boss : No more " showstoppers " for the main city airport .	-7.4173
The operator is satisfied with the course , but the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER .	-6.2964
After large-scale Tüv checks at the terminal of the future capital airport , the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year , as was certain , said Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control panel .	-7.5509
Airport Chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test , but also said that there are still deficiencies to be dealt with in the terminal .	-6.8699
However , there are indications that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large , and the notification of construction completion will now be submitted to the construction authority during the first quarter of 2020 , which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year .	-8.1848
Hundreds of electrical cables have yet to be remedied ; the Tüv wants to examine them by February .	-7.1924
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is a question of missing proof , less of new cables , and that there is still no clearance for nononozzles on which the cable lines hang .	-7.9083
In addition , the fire protection at the crossing to the station under the terminal has not yet worked satisfactorily , and the problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago , this time about smoke burns that go down like a screen in a fire , so that the smoke does not spread out , so that 36 engines will have to be replaced , so that at the beginning of the year there will be new tests with hot gas smoke .	-12.1008
The airport was originally scheduled to be operational in 2011 , and costs increased from two billion euros to approximately 6.5 billion euros in the opening of next year since the start .	-9.9640
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then , those in charge are planning to expand the airport , which is what the Chairman of the Supervisory Board announced at a special meeting on 18 October .	-6.4581
The airport company is now looking for two new Managing Directors : Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster moves to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year , Head of Human Resources Manfred Bobke-von Camen retires next year , as Bretschneider said , and thanked F.	-11.3249

There are many private Koran schools in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria , replacing the often deficient state institutions , with the region ’ s people suffering from frequent attacks by armed gangs , which , according to the UN Refugee Agency , has led to more than 40,000 people crossing the border to Niger .	-8.2547

World Football Battle : Further charges of Messis and Klops Kür	-4.1047
Football " Signature Not Valid "	-2.7904
Jürgen Klopp , Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded the prize .	-2.3902
With a gala in Milan , the Fifa World Football Association is the best player , the best player and the best coach of the year .	-5.0193
After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he had never voted in the World Cup election , charges have been levelled at Fifa from other countries , and Egypt has not been rated on a strange grounds .	-8.1650
In recent years , much of Fifa ’ s work has proved to be deceitful : the World Cup awards , the dubious plans of its President , Gianni Infantino , the general behaviour of various corrupt officials .	-17.1316
But , having already complained that Nicaragua ’ s captain had not voted at all , further inconsistencies are emerging : Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account ; indeed , they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview .	-6.0470
The Fifa apologises in the sense that " the signatures on the electoral forms were written in uppercase and therefore not valid " .	-6.5480
Sudan ’ s Trainer	-1.9208
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election , and while the situation in Egypt is understandable , the Sudanese Association states that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally judged : with Lionel Messi in first place , Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three .	-7.6667
Nicaragua 's captain , Juan Barrera , had also been accused of not voting for the # TheBest2019 Awards .	-6.2732
On Friday , the Association announced that it was right , but of course there was no intention : the completed electoral documents were " mistakenly " marked with the name and signature of Juan Barrera , the captain of the Nicaraguan selection , as stated in a communication from the Association , but in fact the second captain , Manuel Rosas , was elected , " We take responsibility for the administrative error , " as stated in , but both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte voted for Messi , " all the way in the official FIFA list " .	-11.1745
The other cases are now being examined by Fifa in an investigation , but it is emphasised that the electoral process has been externally supervised by the consultancy PriceWaterhouseCoopers . As Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world election - and Jürgen Klopp the world coach of the year .	-8.7066
Ukraine ’ s Affair : Senior Republicans advocate official investigation	-4.8012
" I think the investigation is important , " says Republican Governor Vermont Scott . " Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being determined . " He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken .	-5.8855
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations , which showed that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine , according to Scott , " for years . "	-5.3383
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump over the Whistleblower affair , and few have been uneasy about it . Scott ’ s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party , with the moderate governor of Virginia having repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies , such as the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration rules .	-7.6485
" It is a deeply disturbing situation , " Baker said . " The right approach and the responsibility for Congress is now to investigate and get to the bottom of the matter . "	-9.1310
Scott and Baker , as Governor of US states , have no formal say in the case of Trump being decided in Congress , so their statements are mostly symbolic , but Republican senators have also been critical of the situation . Mitt Romney , for example , who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament , said that the case was " extremely disturbing , deeply disturbing . " US media also reported that the Republicans were making initial internal fissures .	-10.5552
The affair could lead to the impeachment of Trump , with House Democrats announcing an investigation , accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit .	-6.2640
There is no precise timetable for impeachment ; with a majority in the House of Representatives , the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment , but the decision on actual impeachment would be in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans have a majority , so there is little chance that such a process will succeed ; so far , no US president has been impeached by an impeachment procedure . in . in , in , in , in , , , , , , ,	-13.0184
Were torturers on board of Racketes " Sea Watch " ?	-1.5305
Three men have been arrested in Sicily and raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps .	-2.6214
The German captain Carola Rackete ( 31 ) was arrested in June after having illegally managed the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 Libyan refugees on board .	-4.8047
" We cannot rule this out , but we do not have any secure information about it , " said " Sea Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency .	-6.7680
In mid-September , the police said that the suspects in the North African country had raped , tortured , and even murdered : Mohammed C. ( 27 ) from Guinea , and the two Egyptians Hameda A. ( 26 ) and Mahmoud A ( 24 ) . " The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence , " the communication said .	-5.9574

Musk Waits for Tesla ’ s Extradition Record	-2.6666
Tesla CEO Elon Musk gave his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures .	-5.8685
" We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries , " wrote Musk in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek " .	-4.6455
Tesla is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world .	-9.0211
In the second quarter , Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars , reaching its previous level .	-6.4419
Musk needs records in order to achieve its high goals , and in 2019 he plans to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars , with six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter of the year .	-8.3808
US budget dispute : Bridge-financing	-4.4826
The new financial year will start in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget ; the Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing until 21 November .	-4.9991
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years , the United States once again has no spending plans before the new fiscal year begins on October 1 . The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing ( continuation resolution , CR ) until November 21 . Without such a decision , a shutdown would have occurred on Monday at midnight , a partial shutdown of the federal administration .	-7.3759
Absent Shutdown	-2.0071
For the time being , the Federal Government is to be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019 , which will end on Monday , because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities , so the Federal Government cannot , for the time being , benefit from the extended spending framework for the new financial year from $ 1.3 trillion to $ 1.4 trillion .	-9.1322
In the House of Representatives , where they have the majority , the Democrats have completed ten of the 12 laws , but the spending laws reflect Democrats ’ priorities , which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate , and the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the 12 spending plans that are barely capable of majority voting .	-6.5270
In the Senate , the Republicans seem to be trying to force $ 12 billion to build the Wall , one of President Trump ’ s major priorities . The Democrats are bothered by the Wall building plans and their funding , which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects .	-7.8692
Ghosts Break at the Wall	-3.8338
At the moment , it is unclear how the parties will move forward on this issue ; more likely than agreement on all 12 spending laws over the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond November 21 , and a shutdown is not ruled out .	-6.7250
In the light of the Congress ’ s persistent inability to agree on the 12 spending laws in good time , and the associated risk of a shutdown , ideas about automating the process are gaining popularity .	-10.7279
France Allows Artificial Fertility for Lesbians and Singles	-3.1168
In France , artificial insemination will in future also be open to women and lesbians living alone : the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a bill by the government that allows all women to benefit from in vitro fertilization , which should significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations .	-7.7378
In the three days of emotional debate , critics on the right warned that many " children without a father " could grow up in the future .	-6.7386
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Minister of Health , Agnès Buzyn , defended as an " opportunity " for society , portraying the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents .	-6.4394
Prohibition of sperm from dead husbands	-4.6408
By a narrow majority , the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their dead man for artificial insemination ; in Belgium , Spain , and the United Kingdom artificial insemination is permitted ' post-mortem ' ; in Germany , there have been cases in the past where women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased man ; in Paris , opponents of the offense argued that such a certified child would carry a ' particularly serious fate ' .	-9.1730
Many members of the governing party La République en Marche ( The Republic on the Move , LREM ) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had called for artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner , stressing that a widow would be given a " double mourning " if her husband 's death left her wish to have children unfulfilled .	-7.0504
The initiators of the amendment that has now failed consider it unfair that in future a widow can be tainted with the semen of an unknown , but not with that of her own partner .	-6.1186
In France , artificial insemination is permitted only to heterosexual couples who cannot bear children , who must be married or live together for at least two years .	-5.9719
In Germany , artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples .	-3.4942
Climate Compensation : Calls for a flight levy for universities are rising louder .	-4.9575
There is a lot of flying at universities , which is why the country wants a climate tax to be imposed there too , and the rectors say that they have no money for it , but now they are under internal pressure .	-8.4640
The universities should also restrict themselves to flying .	-5.6487

Russia Retreats North Korean Fishermen	-2.8999
According to the FSB secret service , the detainees have been illegally fished in Russian waters , and 10 days earlier , 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested , at which time there was a change of fire between the border guards and the crew of the boat , injuring three Russians and a North Korean , who later suffered serious injuries , but this time there were no injured , it was said .	-8.7238
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages , so North Korean fishermen were on the way to Russian territorial waters , where , according to their own data , Russia ’ s coastguard patrols to protect its marine biological resources .	-6.0266
30,000 octopus seized	-2.3320
During the re-inspection , 30,000 octopus were discovered and confiscated on the boats , and three fishing and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok .	-6.6816
Russia ’ s fisheries authorities had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year , even after appeals from local entrepreneurs , and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been detained there for a while this year , according to the media .	-6.3463
The head of the union of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje , Georgi Martynov , recently complained of the high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen , who were fishing with synthetic nets banned in Russia , which would also take small creatures out of the sea , and would simply dispose of the nets in the sea , where they needed 200 years to be dismantled .	-7.6894

The " most generous nation in history " : Donald Trump , here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House .	-2.7782
The world ’ s richest country is closed to asylum-seekers : as Washington ’ s State Department confirms , the ceiling on the legal influx of refugees will be lowered further , with , in the future , mainly threatened believers and Iraqis being granted asylum .	-7.4664
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low threshold for receiving new refugees once again . In the 2020 marketing year that runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020 , the US State Department declared that the limit is still 30,000 people .	-6.6102
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has slashed acceptance for guardians from around the world in recent years . Under Barack Obama ’ s previous administration , far higher reception limits had been set .	-6.3463
The proposed ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was launched in 1980 , but the State Department still called the US " the most merciless and generous nation in history , " a phrase that strongly resembles the language used by the incumbent US president .	-6.4568
A " responsible handling " of refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild them , Trump declared .	-6.4728
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to shut down . Trump has imposed the National Emergency to finance the construction of a border wall . Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear .	-6.7439
According to the Foreign Office , the US government intends to focus on receiving two groups of refugees : people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and who are in danger as a result of this , as stated in the State Department statement , while Honduras , Guatemala and El Salvador are to receive a maximum of 1 500 refugees .	-8.1189
The United States wants to see people from this ' northern triangle ' of Central America , in particular , seeking asylum in other countries , and it is against this background that the United States concluded migration agreements with Guatemala , and now with El Salvador and Honduras , in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico .	-7.0174

Stocking Brexit Negotiations : The Risk of No Deal remains acute	-4.1770
In fact , Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made it clear that he will not guarantee a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations , but what has been said about the polarizing British is perpetual . The Supreme Court ’ s recent ruling in Britain hovers like a sword of Damocles over the Blonjahr . His suspension of the parliament in order to be stubbornly able to carry out his bit ’ s course until the exit date was annulled earlier this week , and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral talks until 31 October in the event of failed negotiations with the EU .	-10.4809
Boris Johnson Believes Deal Still	-2.3116
But the pressure does not seem to pass him noticeably either , and in the meantime , when he visited a hospital , he suggested that if he did not , he would support an extension of negotiations until the end of October :	-7.2067
You know , we will abide by the law .	-2.9383
At the same time , however , we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October .	-1.9052
And best with a deal , I am cautiously optimistic that will .	-3.7320
And time is gradually running out of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels , with the EU and the British negotiators having some six weeks left to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement . But the recent talks have again failed to achieve a breakthrough . An agreement by the end of October now seems rather difficult to imagine . If the British Prime Minister does not bring the law into force , the withdrawal date will be postponed again , but the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister ’ s words , fearing that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal .	-10.0355

A phone call in Ukraine , and everything is broken ? US President Donald Trump could actually face impeachment proceedings after the tumultuous revelations of the past few days , the Democrats want to check this with their House inquiry as soon as possible - we are talking about weeks before a decision would be taken .	-7.0319
At the beginning of the scandal , the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj is supposedly the telephone call . The charge of the whistleblower , who ultimately brought the conversation out of concern for national security and for US democracy with his complaint , is monstrous : the president used the power of his office to orchestrate another country ’ s government for influencing the 2020 election , using Ukraine ’ s dependence to blackmail and force it to act against a political opponent .	-9.5093
The core of this project is also to be found in the now-published caption of the conversation with Selenckyj , though it does not reflect the full text . But July 25 ’ s phone call is only an episode of a much larger story , centered on Trump ’ s personal lawyer , Rudy Giuliani .	-9.7047
History begins from the public 's point of view in May 2019 , when Rudy Giuliani 's New York Times reports travel plans to Ukraine ; he wants to meet in Kiev with just elected President Selenskyj , and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate . " We are not interfering in an election , we are interfering in an investigation into what we have the right to do , " he says the newspaper , " it may be inappropriate , but " there is nothing illegal about it , " Giuliani wants to be prosecuted in Ukraine for which there is little basis - " because this information will be very helpful , very helpful for my clients and could prove helpful for my government . "	-9.7486
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiratorial fantasies fixated on Trump ’ s opponent in the 2016 election : Hillary Clinton has conspired with Ukrainian actors , critics said at the time to construct grounds for the US investigation into Russia , but that charge was never serious .	-7.4805
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk about so prominently on the phone in July with Selenskyj . The version of Giulianis and the president is that the former vice president and currently promising candidate for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden , as Obama ’ s Ukrainian envoy , urged the dismissal of the then Ukrainian public prosecutor , Viktor Shokin , to stop the gas company ’ s investigation , in which his son , Hunter Biden , worked on his board , to blackmail Ukraine financially to cover up his family ’ s corrupt machinations .	-9.6613
Indeed , when Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian Attorney-General to go , the investigation of the gas company had already been completed , and Hunter Biden was never directly affected , and Shokin was also accused of deeply corrupt behavior , the US government was far from being the only Western partner to press for his release , and the Obama administration even explicitly investigations .	-7.1815

Does Britain ’ s government want to circumvent Brexit law ?	-9.2813
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been obsessed about whether he is seeking ways to circumvent the law against an unregulated Brexit recently enacted by Parliament , and , on a Friday ’ s question , merely told journalists that his government would abide by the law .	-8.8287
The Act requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal deadline if no agreement with the EU was reached by mid-October , Johnson criticizing it as a " surrender law " that made negotiations with the EU more difficult .	-6.8022
On Thursday , former British Prime Minister John Major suggested that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law , and Johnson could use a trial trick to postpone the law 's entry into force until after the EU leaves .	-6.5263
Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union . ' We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October and the best way forward is by agreement ' .	-4.3554
Iran appears to be hovering on uranium enrichment	-7.3348
Iran 's president , Hassan Rowhani , has increased pressure on Europe 's partners in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal . " Unfortunately , European states show incompetence or unwillingness to take concrete action , " said Rowhani at a press conference on Thursday at the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York .	-6.1196
The US withdrew from the deal in 2018 to force Iran to change course in what is considered to be an aggressive Middle East policy , with President Donald Trump ’ s administration seeking to negotiate a new deal with tougher conditions , and has now returned to tough sanctions against Tehran with a resumption of the treaty ’ s limited uranium enrichment .	-12.5175
The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used , or at least prepared for use , the uranium centrifuges installed at the beginning of September , and , according to IAEA data , Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges .	-4.9607
Perhaps Europeans are not prepared to bear their share of the deal , and so left the Iranians alone with the costs and burdens of stifling US sanctions , alleged Rowhani , but there will still be further talks that we hope will resolve .	-10.2124
Rowhani continues to deny Iran ’ s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia	-2.0735
But the conflagration changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September : Germany , France , and the United Kingdom followed Monday ’ s US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack . Initially , Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had committed to the attack , which the US viewed as a false commitment .	-10.5274
" Those who make such accusations must provide evidence , " said Rowhani , but European leaders would not have been able to do so in talks with him during the UN General Debate ; instead , they would simply have called for the rebels in Yemen not to launch an attack like this .

Comet of Another Star Cruises Solar System	-3.3657
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space , which was first successful , and the comet allows conclusions about other solar systems .	-7.0229
What was initially only an assumption is now confirmed : an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system .	-5.0768
The farthest comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea with a self-built telescope of 65 cm diameter .	-5.3251
2I / Borisov , after 1I / ' Oumuamua of 2017 , is only the second interstellar object that was spotted during a flight through our solar system .	-4.3646
" The current speed of the comet is high , about 150,000 kilometers per hour , which is far above the typical speeds of objects circling the sun , " said Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa in a communication .	-6.4291
According to the analysis , the comet is on the way to a so-called hyperbolic orbit that takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin , as the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) announced .	-7.1078
Astronomers are lucky : In contrast to 1I / ' Oumuamua 2I / Borisov has already been spotted , leaving many months for researchers to investigate .	-6.4904
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor , including a team around Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii , who had already guided the characterization of 1I / ' Oumuamua , in a first investigation , determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers .	-6.5791
Researchers of the Canary Islands astrophysical institute ( IAC ) have already obtained a first spectrum of interstellar welders that provides a kind of fingerprint of their chemical composition .	-13.0682

Wanting in Washington : Trump wants to find anonymous tippers in the Ukraine affair	-5.6877
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of US President power , Donald Trump wants to find possible leaks in the White House .	-3.9619
" I want to know who gave Whistleblower the information , " Trump said Thursday to staff of the United Nations Mission in New York . the person concerned was almost " a spy , " and they have " a bit different " in the past than they are today .	-7.9439
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate whistleblowers , but several US media reported on Friday ’ s speech , and Democrats reacted outrageously to the president ’ s statement .	-8.5930
On Tuesday , US House Democrats announced preparations for an impeachment trial against Trump , based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence worker making serious charges against Trump and his headquarters . on public pressure the statement on Thursday .	-8.3571
As part of his work , the Whistleblower wants information from several government officials that the US president " uses the power of his office " to get another country to interfere in the US election in his favor in 2020 .	-5.5263
At the center of the charges is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukraine ’ s President Volodymyr Selenskyy in late July , in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that might harm his political rival , Joe Biden , about former deals by Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his spin-off from Ukrainian justice . Biden is ahead of the race for the Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election .	-7.8363
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to Ukraine ’ s telephone call : senior government officials have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling .	-7.1077
The New York Times reported that it should be a member of the CIA .	-8.3143
On Friday , Trump again questioned the credibility of the source ; in a series of tweets on the subject , the president wrote , among other things , that the “ whistleblower ” has distributed second-hand information that would have proved to be inaccurate , so there may be no typing or spies at all .	-6.9265
As Trump said in New York about the information that the whistleblower was supposed to have received , he ignited outrage . US House Chairman Nancy Pelosi was alarmed and lamented that Trump ’ s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government .	-7.2366
In the House of Representatives , various investigations have been underway against Trump and his environment for months in various committees , and , in the face of Ukraine ’ s charges , the Democrats are now launching an investigation with renewed vigour to initiate a possible impeachment of Trump .	-8.1241
" The Whistleblower has given us a road map for our investigation , " said the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , Adam Schiff .	-10.6125
More than 300 former US security and foreign policy officials , most of whom were democratic but also Republican presidents , backed the Democratic inquiry launched on Friday for a possible impeachment . If the allegations were true , Trump said it would be " an unscrupulous abuse of power . "	-10.9072
With a majority in the House of Representatives , the Democrats could pursue an impeachment process , but the decision to actually impeach him would be taken in the Senate , where Trump ’ s Republicans hold the majority , so there is little chance that such a process will succeed .	-8.7009
Works Council : Jobs are being ' silenced ' .	-4.7863
The Volkswagen brand ’ s plans to reduce production costs further could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe , a concern that drives the works council of the car manufacturer to reduce its annual factory costs of EUR 10 billion by EUR 2 billion by 2023 , of which EUR 500 million is to be saved this year .	-7.3690
The " Future Pact " , which was negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 , already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020 .	-5.4648
However , as our newspaper has now learned from business board circles , jobs in production that are not actually available are being " stealthed " through a different route - that is , bypassing the official course , often leaving vacant regular jobs unfilled .	-9.6670
In these cases , the works council has no way of forcing the re-establishment of the company ; meanwhile , many jobs are lacking , the work compression is increasing , the worries about the gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants are increasing , so there is also a growing fear that vehicle production might gradually be diverted from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world .	-12.0368
The Volkswagen brand aims to further standardize production worldwide and centrally control new projects .	-6.4665

An actor and Youtube attributes Egypt ’ s ruler : for the time being , Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad .	-4.6725
The two men who have an influence over whether blood will flow on Egypt ’ s streets have both been abroad last week , and one of them was back at Cairo airport on Friday . President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly . The ex-general , who in 2013 removed the Muslim Brotherhood Mohammed Morsi , the country ’ s first freely elected leader , had spent a pleasant time in New York : US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi ’ s actions against political Islam and not lost a syllable about human rights violations on the Nile – a week in which Egypt ’ s security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president .	-12.7675
Mohamed Ali , of course , remained abroad , evading the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil .	-7.0509
He goes to the head of state directly and in a very rustic language ; while the people are hungry , the president is hovering in luxury and are building magnificent new palaces , he says ; the army , on Sisi , accusof corruption and enrichment ; , because in in as , , , , , , and , and .	-13.4565

When Provider Promises Too Much Performance	-1.9211
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider , there are various testing possibilities .	-4.7433
If you sign an Internet contract , you do not need to trust the speed data of the providers blindly ; customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved if there is something to show .	-8.5589
Finally , the previously promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved , says the Consumer Centre of Bavaria .	-5.0126
If the connection always appears to be much slower than advertised by the provider , there are different ways of checking , for example , the measuring tools of the Bundesnetzagentur ( BNetzA ) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract .	-6.9342
" However , the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to the supplier specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively " , says the Consumer Centre of Bavaria on its side .	-12.5021
If the connection is much slower than announced , customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days for the supplier to produce the promised service .	-5.2471
If this does not apply even after several requests , customers may cancel and may also claim damages .	-7.9664

Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy in a phone call to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine , for Trump has been watching Biden " for years . "	-5.2500
Republicans have so far withstood criticism of Trump over the Whistleblower affair , with few showing unease . Scott ’ s statements are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party . Scott , a moderate Republican , has already opposed Trump ’ s policies on several occasions , such as the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration rules .	-10.5347

The Canadian Grünen boss holds a reusable hand in a photo , but now it came out : the cup was manipulated .	-7.2466
Ottawa / Canada - It has not been noticed for quite a long time - and has finally come to light .	-8.5733
Green bosses must answer for photo pans	-4.8714
The National Post then accused May of manipulation , and that the Party produces fake news in order to be more credible on the issue of environmental protection , in the midst of an election campaign for the House of Commons , in which Trudeau has become increasingly difficult because of a corruption scandal .	-7.9087
The photo went viral in the social media and raised the discussion about fake news .	-5.3419

Influencecerin wants to upgrade free of charge : a life-long flight ban at Cathay . .	-11.2339
Jaqueline Ng was reportedly promised an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific , but when she asked for it at check-in she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly again with Cathay Pacific .	-5.7824
Once you are upgraded to Business Class , many passengers dream of it , sometimes they are lucky , and the check-in staff offer a free Economy Class change .	-8.5487
This case shows how not to do it : A self-declared influenza cerin has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade .	-7.2972
Jaqueline ’ s staff refused to upgrade on their way to the airport , despite the fact that they had sent a mail telling them that they were planning an upgrade to Cathay Pacific .	-11.0369
This time Jaqueline was reported to have shown the same mail , but with another reference number .	-8.5376
The airline staff at the airport cancels Jaqueline 's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific .	-6.3802
In her case , the Influencercerin turned to Elliot Advocacy , a company that represents consumer interests , because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket , but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket back .	-8.7909
Jaqueline ’ s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight , which Jaqueline does not want to settle for - and is now hiring a lawyer .	-8.2868
Oil Prices After Report on Armistice in Yemen	-3.7159
The U.S. dollar is the highest in the world , and the U.S. dollar is the lowest in the world .	-11.1397
The coup was triggered by a Wall Street Journal report on a cease-fire in Yemen , with Saudi Arabia reportedly agreeing to a ceasefire in four areas .	-5.1371
In mid-September , a drone attack on Saudi Arabia ’ s oil facilities had halted five per cent of global oil production . The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had claimed the attacks ; Saudi Arabia , like the US government , blames Iran ; a ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region .	-7.0484
If an agreement is reached , it can focus on growth and demand , said Ole Hansen , Head of the Commodity Strategy Department at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency .	-4.5118
Oil prices are continuing its downward trend in recent days , with a barrel of WTI oil costing almost $ 59 a week ago , Brent costing almost $ 65 .	-4.8690
Most recently , according to Insider , Bloomberg reported that oil repair work in Saudi Arabia was progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September , so that production had returned to a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back to the original quantity .	-8.4290
Most recently , there have been press releases calling on insiders to report rapid progress in repair work by the Saudi Aramco state-owned oil company , but raw materials experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is planning a stock exchange and is trying to avoid negative headlines .	-8.7465
At the same time , there was some sense of relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries : the British oil tanker ' Stena Impero ' is on the way to leaving the port more than two months after Iran 's arrest and the recent release of the vessel , which is now preparing the departure while the ship is still on the dock , the shipping arm Erik Hånell informed Swedish radio on Friday morning in an SMS message .	-14.2850
But the US announced that it would move defense missiles and soldiers to Iran ’ s arch-enemy , Saudi Arabia . Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom at times pushed up oil prices sharply in recent weeks .	-5.9222
Recriminating Trump	-3.3921
In the case of US President Donald Trump ’ s possible abuse of power , allegations of cover-up have been made against the White House . Several senior officials would have worked hard to prevent access to the talk ’ s text after a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenkkyy at the end of July , as an anonymous whistleblower explained .	-8.7940
North Korea ’ s Third Trump and Kim Summits	-3.0992
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon take place on the nuclear issue . The sense and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of a lack of progress in implementing first-summit agreements in Singapore , said senior diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday , according to the KCNA agency .	-6.1667
The US has not yet done anything to implement last year ’ s summit decisions , said the North Korean Foreign Ministry ’ s adviser , and has criticized tougher US sanctions and joint military exercises by the US and South Korea , but he hopes for a “ wise ” and “ bold ” decision by Trump to bring the rapprochement back .	-10.3881
On Monday , Trump said that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he declared himself ready . Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second Trump and Kim summit in Hanoi in February , and both met in June in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states , agreeing to revive the talks , but with little success .	-7.1497

Pound Under Pressure - Reduction in Interest	-3.8618
British Pound under Pressure	-2.1373
With interest rates cut soon , the pound will lose value against the euro .	-4.1860
Frankfurt speculated that the Bank of England ( BoE ) would soon cut interest rates on the pound sterling .	-5.6232
The sales triggered statements by central banker Michael Saunders , who called for a cut in interest rates even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted , because uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future , a statement that is surprising , given that Saunders is regarded as a champion of restrictive monetary policy , as Brokerhaus ActiveTrades analyst Ricardo Evangelista said .	-7.5130
Last week , the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy caused by the Brexit hack , without sending a direct signal of a cut in interest rates . Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take his country out of the EU by 31 October , even without a divorce agreement .	-7.5586
Moreover , with his provocations , the British Prime Minister took a high risk , but he could pay off , says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel .	-5.5584
Doping : Further Russian Manipulation	-1.6809
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman , the former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( Wada ) and the current Chief of Integrity of the World Athletics Association .	-5.4397
In January 2019 , the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency ( Wada ) .	-3.7484
In December 2014 , systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed , and the Wada had banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( Rusada ) for three years . During this period , Russian athletes were not banned from the world stage altogether . The International Olympic Committee , after an individual test at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio , had some 270 athletes of the country compete under a neutral flag , while at the Winter Games in February 2018 , 168 Russian athletes were on the start , and they were in in the World Cup , in Russia in in . in , in , , , , and . , , , , , , , and , , , , ,	-13.5134
Positive findings are missing .	-2.0099
In the following September , the Wada lifted the Rusada ban , but demanded access to the laboratory and the specimens in question .	-6.9655
" Yes , we received the data nine months ago and we should check that the task force has received the correct data , " said David Howman in Friday 's " Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung " interview .	-5.2832
Not affected by the World Cup	-1.9140
This is confirmed by the position of the IAAF : The athletics association is the only organisation to hold the flag of Russia , with 30 Russian athletes flying a neutral flag at the World Cup in Doha , having to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests .	-8.4797
At the beginning of this week , the Wada had already thrown up manipulations and asked Russia to respond within three weeks to the accusations , and Russia is now threatening to freeze the Rusada again and , in the worst case , to exclude the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo .	-7.8278
