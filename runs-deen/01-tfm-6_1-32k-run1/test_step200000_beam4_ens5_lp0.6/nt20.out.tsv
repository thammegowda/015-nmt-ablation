At the beginning of the scandal , the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj , the charge of the whistleblowers , who ultimately brought the conversation out for concern for national security and democracy of the US with his complaint , is monstrous : the president used the power of his office to use the government of another country to influence the 2020 election , which has blackmailed Ukraine ’ s dependence in doing so to force it to act against a political opponent .	-9.3068
